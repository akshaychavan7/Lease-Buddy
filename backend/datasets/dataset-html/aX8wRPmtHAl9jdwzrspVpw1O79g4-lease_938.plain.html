Identification: Clearly mark trees to be removed. Safety: Comply with Forestry and Arboriculture Safety and Training Council Safety Guides. Felling: Cut down and grub up roots of shrubs and smaller trees. Fell larger trees as close to the ground as possible and remove root ball. Work near retained trees: Take down trees carefully in small sections to avoid damage to adjacent trees that are to be retained, where tree canopies overlap and in confined spaces generally. Stumps: Obtain approval before removing stumps by winching and do not use other trees as supports or anchors. 181 SITE CLEARANCE Clear site of rubbish, debris and vegetation. Large roots: Grub up and dispose of without undue disturbance of soil and adjacent areas. 210 MATERIALS ARISING Ownership: Excavated materials, including topsoil, surplus to requirements for filling remain the property of the Employer unless the Contractor: - Is instructed to remove them from the site, or - Purchases them at a price to be agreed.

          <p id="s1p293">GGlanville 220 STRIPPING TOPSOIL General: Before beginning general excavation or filling, strip topsoil from areas where there will be regrading, buildings, pavings/roads and other areas shown on drawings. Drawing references: prefixed ST8150511. Depth: Remove to an average depth of 200 mm and keep separate from excavated subsoil. Give notice where the depth of topsoil is difficult to determine. Around trees: Do not remove topsoil from below the spread of trees to be retained. 230 BENCHING Surfaces of excavations with a gradient greater than 1:5 (20%) and which are to receive filling: Provide horizontal benches cut to match the depths of compacted layers of filling. 240 ADJACENT EXCAVATIONS Proximity: Where an excavation encroaches below a line drawn at an angle from the nearest formation level of another higher excavation, the lower excavation, all work within it and backfilling thereto must be completed before the higher excavation is made. Angle of line from horizontal: 45deg. 250 PERMISSIBLE DEVIATIONS FROM FORMATION LEVELS Beneath mass concrete foundations: +-25 mm. Beneath ground bearing slabs and r.c. foundations: +-15 mm. Embankments and cuttings: +-50 mm. Ground abutting external walls: +-50 mm, but such as to ensure that finished level is not less than 150 mm below dpc. Carriageways: +0 to 50mm 260 INSPECTING FORMATIONS Notice: Make advance arrangements for inspection of formations for all permanent works. Preparation: Just before inspection remove the last 150 mm of excavation. Trim to required profiles and levels, and remove loose material. Seal: Within 4 hours of inspection, seal formations with concrete. Notice: Obtain instruction if the formation contains soft or hard spots or highly variable material. 270 FOUNDATIONS GENERALLY Give notice if: - The formation contains soft or hard spots or highly variable material. - A natural bearing foundation of undisturbed subsoil is not obtained at the depth shown on the drawings. 280 TRENCH FILL FOUNDATIONS Excavation: Form trench down to formation in one operation. Safety: Prepare formation from ground level. Inspection of formations: Give notice to employer before commencing excavation. Shoring: Where inspection of formation is required, provide localised shoring to suit ground conditions. Concrete fill: Place concrete immediately after inspection and no more than four hours after exposing the formation. Ref: ST8150511/NL/DW/005 2 Issue 1: 29 July 2015</p>
          <p id="s1p294">GGlanville 310 UNSTABLE GROUND Generally: Ensure that the excavation remains stable at all times. Give notice: Without delay if any newly excavated faces are too unstable to allow earthwork support to be inserted. Take action: If instability is likely to affect adjacent structures or roadways, take appropriate emergency action. 320 RECORDED FEATURES Recorded foundations, beds, drains, manholes, etc: Break out and seal drain ends. Contaminated earth: Remove and disinfect as required by local authority. 330 UNRECORDED FEATURES Give notice: If unrecorded foundations, beds, voids, basements, filling, tanks, pipes, cables, drains, manholes, watercourses, ditches, etc. not shown on the drawings are encountered. 360 EXCESS EXCAVATION Excavation taken wider than required: Backfill with the material specified for backfilling. Excavation taken deeper than required: Backfill with lean mix concrete. DISPOSAL OF MATERIALS 441 SURPLUS SUBSOIL Excavated material to be retained: Stockpile in temporary spoil heaps. Retained material: Refer to geotechnical remediation specification. Protected areas: Do not raise soil level within root spread of trees that are to be retained. Surplus excavated material: Remove from site. 450 WATER Generally: Keep all excavations free from water until: - - - Formations are covered. Below ground construction are completed. Basement structures and retaining walls are able to resist leakage, water pressure and flotation. Drainage: Form surfaces of excavations and fill to provide adequate falls. Removal of water: Provide temporary drains, sumps and pumping as necessary. 454 GROUND WATER LEVEL Give notice: If it is considered that the excavations are below water table. 457 PUMPING General: Do not disturb excavated faces or stability of adjacent ground or structures. Pumped water: Discharge without flooding the site, or adjoining property. Sumps: Construct clear of excavations. Fill on completion. Ref: ST8150511/NL/DW/005 3 Issue 1: 29 July 2015</p>

Proposals for processing and reuse of material excavated on site. Test reports as required elsewhere. 510 HAZARDOUS, AGGRESSIVE OR UNSTABLE MATERIALS General: Do not use fill materials which would, either in themselves or in combination with other materials or ground water, give rise to a health hazard, damage to building structures or instability in the filling, including material that is: - - - - - - - - Frozen or containing ice. Organic. Contaminated or noxious. Susceptible to spontaneous combustion. Likely to erode or decay and cause voids. With excessive moisture content, slurry, mud or from marshes or bogs.

Free from deleterious salts, contaminants and cement. Obtain from only one source and ensure that all sand supplied has consistent grading. Maintain at even moisture content which will give maximum compaction. Sand squeezed in the hand should show no free water and bind together when pressure is released. 290 SAND FOR JOINTING (NON PERMEABLE FOOTWAYS): Clean free flowing kiln dried silica sand. Do not use sand that will stain paving blocks. Free from deleterious salts, contaminants and cement. 291 GRIT FOR JOINTING (PERMEABLE PAVING) To Hanson Formpave specification. Vibrate blocks again and remove surplus grit. 300 LAYING BEDDING: Determine by trial on site the depth of loose bedding material needed to ensure the specified thickness after final compaction of paving. Maintain an prepared area of bedding not less than 1m and not more than 3m in advance of the laying face at all times, and not more than 1m at the conclusion of any working period. Do not leave areas of bedding exposed; proceed with laying blocks/pavers immediately. Do not deliver bedding sand to working area over uncompacted paving. Prevent disturbance to the bedding course by pedestrian or wheeled traffic. Fill, rescreed and recompact any parts of the bedding layer disturbed by removal of screeds rails or trafficking. 310A LAYING BLOCKS/PAVERS: Commencing from an edge restraint, lay blocks/pavers hand tight with a joint width of 2-5 mm. Maintain an open working face and do not use mechanical force to obtain tight joints. Place blocks/pavers squarely with minimum disturbance to bedding. Supply blocks/pavers to laying face over newly laid paving but stack at least 1 m back from laying face. Do not allow plant to traverse areas of uncompacted paving. Continually check alignment of pavers with string lines as work proceeds to ensure maintenance of accurate bond. lnfill at edge restraints as work proceeds. Wherever the type of bond and angle of edging permit, avoid very small infill pieces at edges by breaking bond on the next course in from the edge, using cut locks/pavers not less than 1/3 full size. 315A OBSTRUCTIONS: After laying full paving units, trim blocks/pavers neatly around drainage fittings and other obstructions, with joints not exceeding 5 mm and without reducing the thickness of the blocks/pavers. Provide and install 'special' block units as agreed with the CA Where this is not possible, form a rectangular in situ surround of grade C35 air entrained concrete, maximum aggregate size 10 mm, to BS 5328, with a minimum thickness of the combined depth of blocks/pavers and sand bedding, and a minimum width of 100 mm all round the obstruction, colour matched to approval.
