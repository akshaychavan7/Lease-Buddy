The Lessee is also granted the right to locate mineral deposits under the mining laws (30 U.S.C. 21-54), which would constitute by-products if commercial production or utilization of geothermal steam continued, but such a location to be valid must be completed within ninety (90) days after the termination of this lease. Any conversion of this lease to a mineral lease or a mining claim is contingent on the availability of such lands for this purpose at the time of the conversion. If the lands are withdrawn or acquired to aid of a function of any Federal Department or agency, the mineral lease or mining claim shall be subject to such additional terms and conditions as may be prescribed by such Department or agency for the purpose of making operations thereon consistent with the purposes for which these lands are administered; and (e) The right without the payment of royalties hereunder, to reinject into the leased lands geothermal resources and condensates to the extent that such resources and condensates are not utilized, but their reinjection is necessary for operations under this lease in the recovering or processing of geothermal resources. If the Lessee, pursuant to any approved plan, disposes of the unusable brine and produced waste products into underlying formations, he may do so without the payment of royalties. Sec. 2. TERM (a) This lease shall be for a primary term of ten (10) years from the effective date and so long thereafter as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial quantities but shall in no event continue for more then forty (40) years after the end of the primary term. However, if at the end of that forty-year period geothermal steam is being produced or utilized in commercial quantities, and the leased lands are not needed for other purposes, the Lessee shall have a preferential right to a renewal of this lease for a second forty-year term in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Lessor deems appropriate. (b) If actual drilling operations are commenced on the leased lands or under an approved plan or agreement on behalf of the leased lands prior to the end of the 4 primary term, and are being diligently prosecuted at the end of the primary term, this lease shall be extended for five (5) years and so long thereafter, but not more than thirty-five (35) years, as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial quantities. If at the end of such extended term geothermal steam is being produced or utilized in commercial quantities, the Lessee shall have a preferential right to a renewal for a second term as in (a) above. (c) If the Lessor determines at any time after the primary term that this lease is incapable of commercial production and utilization of geothermal steam, but one or more valuable by-products are or can be produced in commercial quantities, this lease shall be extended for so long as such by-products are produced in commercial quantities but not for more than five (5) years from the date of such determination. Sec. 3. RENTALS AND ROYALTIES (a) Annual Rental - For each lease year prior to the commencement of production of geothermal resources in commercial quantities on the leased lands, the Lessee shall pay the Lessor on or before the anniversary date of the lease a rental of $2.00 for each acre or fraction thereof. (b) Escalating Rental - Beginning with the sixth lease year and for each year thereafter until the lease year beginning on or after the commencement of production of geothermal resources in commercial quantities, the Lessee shall pay on or before the anniversary date of the lease an escalated rental in an amount per acre or fraction thereof equal to the rental per acre for the preceding year and an additional sum of one (1) dollar per acre or fraction thereof. If the lease is extended beyond ten (10) years for reasons other than the commencement of production of geothermal resources in commercial quantities, the rental for the eleventh year and for each lease year thereafter until the lease year beginning on or after the commencement of such production will be the amount of rental for the tenth lease year. If any expenditures are made in any lease year for diligent exploration on the leased lands in excess of the minimum required expenditures for that year, the excess may be credited against any rentals in excess of $6.00 per acre or fraction thereof due the Lessor for that or any future year. (c) Royalty - On or before the last day of the calendar month after the month of commencement of production in commercial quantities of geothermal resources and thereafter on a monthly basis, the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor: (1) A royalty of 10 percent on the amount or value of steam, or any other form of heat or other associated energy produced, processed, removed, sold, or utilized from this lease or reasonably susceptible to sale or utilization by the Lessee. 5 (2) A royalty of 5 percent of the value of any by-product derived from production under this lease, produced, processed, removed, sold, or utilized from this lease or reasonably susceptible of sale or utilization by the Lessee, except that as to any by-product which is a mineral named in Sec. 1 of the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended, (30 U.S.C. 181), the rate of royalty for such mineral shall be the same as that provided in that statute and the maximum rate of royalty for such mineral shall not exceed the maximum royalty applicable under that statute. (3) A royalty of 5 percent of the value of commercially demineralized water which has been produced from the leased lands, and has been sold or utilized by the Lessee or is reasonably susceptible of sale or utilization by the Lessee. In no event shall the Lessee pay to the Lessor, for the lease year beginning on or after the commencement of production in commercial quantities on the leased lands or any subsequent lease year, a royalty of less than two (2) dollars per acre or fraction thereof. If royalty paid on production during the lease year has not satisfied this requirement, the Lessee shall pay the difference on or before the expiration date of the lease year for which it is paid. (d) Waiver and Suspension of Rental and Royalties - Rentals or royalties may be waived, suspended, or reduced pursuant to the applicable regulations on the entire leasehold or any portion thereof in the interest of conservation or for the purpose of encouraging the greatest ultimate recovery of geothermal resources if the Lessor determines that it is necessary to do so to promote such development, or because the lease cannot be successfully operated under the terms fixed herein. (e) Undivided Fractional Interests - Where the interest of the Lessor in the geothermal resources underlying any tract or tracts described in Sec. 1 is an undivided fractional interest, the rentals and royalties payable on account of each such tract shall be in the same proportion to the rentals and royalties provided in this lease as the individual fractional interest of the Lessor in the geothermal resources underlying such tract is to the full fee interest. (f) Readjustments - Rentals and royalties hereunder may be readjusted in accordance with the Act and regulations to rates not in excess of the rates provided therein, and at not less than twenty (20) year intervals beginning thirty-five (35) years after the date geothermal steam is produced from the lease as determined by the Supervisor. Sec. 4. PAYMENTS - It is expressly understood that the Secretary may establish the values and minimum values of geothermal resources to compute royalties in accordance with the applicable regulations. Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, all payments to the Lessor will be made as required by the regulations. If there is no well on the leased 6 lands capable of producing geothermal resources in commercial quantities, the failure to pay rental on or before the anniversary date shall cause the lease to terminate by operation of law except as provided by Sec. 3244.2 of the regulations. If the time for payment falls on a day on which the proper office to receive payment is closed, payment shall be deemed to be made on time if made on the next official working day. Sec. 5. BONDS - The Lessee shall file with the Authorized Officer of the Bureau (hereinafter called the &quot;Authorized Officer&quot;) shall maintain at all times the bonds required under the regulations to be furnished as a condition to the issuance of this lease or prior to entry on the leased lands in the amounts established by the Lessor and to furnish such additional bonds or security as may be required by the Lessor upon entry on the lands or after operations or production have begun. Sec. 6. WELLS (a) The Lessee shall drill and produce all wells necessary to protect the leased land from drainage by operations on lands not the property of the Lessor, or other lands of the Lessor leased at a lower royalty rate, or on lands as to which royalties and rentals are paid into different funds from those into which royalties under this lease are paid. However, in lieu of any part of such drilling and production, with the consent of the Supervisor, the Lessee may compensate the Lessor in full each month for the estimated loss of royalty through drainage in the amount determined by said Supervisor. (b) At the Lessee's election, and with the approval of the Supervisor, the Lessee shall drill and produce other wells in conformity with any system of well spacing or production allotments affecting the field or area in which the leased lands are situated, which is authorized by applicable law. (c) After due notice in writing, the Lessee shall diligently drill and produce such wells as the Supervisor shall require so that the leased lands may be properly and timely developed and for the production of geothermal steam and its by-products, including commercially demineralized water for beneficial uses in accordance with applicable state laws. However, the Supervisor may waive or modify the requirements of this subparagraph (c) in the interest of conservation of natural resources or for economic feasibility or other reasons satisfactory to him. If the products or by-products of geothermal production from wells drilled on this lease are susceptible of producing commercially demineralized water for beneficial uses, and a program therefor is not initiated with due diligence, the Lessor may at its option elect to take such products or by-products and the Lessee shall deliver all or any portion thereof to the Lessor at any point in the Lessee's geothermal gathering or disposal system without cost to the Lessee, if the Lessee's activities, under the lease, would not be impaired and such delivery would otherwise be consistent with field and operational requirements. The retention of this 7 option by the Lessor shall in no way relieve the Lessee from the duty of producing commercially demineralized water where required to do so by the Lessor, except when the option is being exercised and then only with respect to wells where it is being exercised, or limit the Lessor's right to take any action under Sec. 25 to enforce that requirement. Sec. 7. INSPECTION - The Lessee shall keep open at all reasonable times for the inspection of any duly authorized representative of the Lessor the leased lands and all wells, improvements, machinery, and fixtures thereon and all production reports, maps, records, books, and accounts relative to operations under the lease, and well logs, surveys, or investigations of the leased lands. Sec. 8. CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS - The Lessee shall conduct all operations under this lease in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable statutes, regulations, and GRO orders, and all other appropriate directives of the Lessor to prevent bodily injury, danger to life or health, or property damage, and to avoid the waste of resources, and shall comply with all requirements which are set forth in 43 CFR Group 3200, including, but not limited to, Sub-part 3204, or which may be prescribed by the Lessor pursuant to the regulations, and with the special stipulations which are attached to the lease, all of which are specifically incorporated into this lease. A breach of any term of this lease, including the stipulations attached hereto, will be subject to all the provisions of this lease with respect to remedies in case of default. Where any stipulation is inconsistent with a regular provision of this lease, the stipulation shall govern. Sec. 9. INDEMNIFICATION (a) The Lessee shall be liable to the Lessor for any damage suffered by the Lessor in any way arising from or connected with the Lessee's activities and operations conducted pursuant to this lease, except where damage is caused by employees of the Lessor acting within the scope of their authority. (b) The Lessee shall indemnify and hold harmless the Lessor from all claims arising from or connected with the Lessee's activities and operations under this lease. (c) In any case where liability without fault is imposed on the Lessee pursuant to this section, and the damages involved were caused by the action of a third party, the rules of subrogation shall apply in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction where the damage occurred.

RESERVATIONS TO LESSOR - All rights in the leased area not granted to the Lessee by this lease are hereby reserved to the Lessor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing such reserved rights include: (a) Disposal - The right to sell or otherwise dispose of the surface of the leased lands or any resource in the leased lands under existing laws, or laws hereafter enacted, subject to the rights of the Lessee under this lease; (b) Rights-of-way - The right to authorize geological and geophysical explorations on the leased lands which do not interfere with or endanger actual operations under this lease, and the right to grant such easements or rights-of-way for joint or several use upon, through or in the leased area for steam lines and other public or private purposes which do not interfere with or endanger actual operations or facilities constructed under this lease; (c) Mineral Rights - The ownership of and the right to extract oil, hydrocarbon gas, and helium from all geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources produced from the leased lands; (d) Casing - The right to acquire the well and casing at the fair market value of the casing where the Lessee finds only potable water, and such water is not required in lease operations; and (e) Measurements - The right to measure geothermal resources and to sample any production thereof. 10 Sec. 18. ANTIQUITIES AND OBJECTS OF HISTORIC VALUE - The Lessee shall immediately bring to the attention of the Authorized Officer any antiquities or other objects of historic or scientific interest, including but not limited to historic or prehistoric ruins, fossils, or artifacts discovered as a result of operations under this lease, and shall leave such discoveries intact. Failure to comply with any of the terms and conditions imposed by the Authorized Officer with regard to the preservation of antiquities may constitute a violation of the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-433). Prior to operations, the Lessee shall furnish to the Authorized Officer a certified statement that either no archaeological values exist or that they may exist on the leased lands to the best of the of the Lessee's knowledge and belief and that they might be impaired by geothermal operations. If the Lessee furnishes a statement that archaeological values may exist where the land is to be disturbed or occupied, the Lessee will engage a qualified archaeologist, acceptable to the Authorized Officer, to survey and salvage, in advance of any operations, such archaeological values on the lands involved. The responsibility for the cost for the certificate, survey, and salvage will be borne by the Lessee, and such salvaged property shall remain the property of the Lessor or the surface owner. Sec. 19. DIRECTIONAL DRILLING - A directional well drilled under the leased area from a surface location on nearby land not covered by the lease shall be deemed to have the same affect for all purposes of this lease as a well drilled from a surface location on the leased area. In such circumstances, drilling shall be considered to have been commenced on the nearby land for the purposes of this lease, and production of geothermal resources from the leased area through any directional well located on nearby land, or drilling or reworking of any such directional well shall be considered production or drilling or reworking operations (as the case may be) on the leased area for all purposes of this lease. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as granting to the Lessee any right in any land outside the leased area. Sec. 20. OVERRIDING ROYALTIES - The Lessee shall not create overriding royalties of less than one-quarter (1/4) of one percent of the value of output nor in excess of 50 percent of the rate of royalty due to the Lessor specified in Sec. 3 of this lease except as otherwise authorized by the regulations. The Lessee expressly agrees that the creation of any overriding royalty which does not provide for a prorated reduction of all overriding royalties so that the aggregate rate of royalties does not exceed the maximum rate permissible under this section, or the failure to suspend an overriding royalty during any period when the royalties due to the Lessor have been suspended pursuant to the terms of this lease, shall constitute a violation of the lease terms. Sec. 21. READJUSTMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS - The terms and conditions of this lease other then those related to rentals and royalties may be readjusted in accordance with the Act at not less than ten-year intervals beginning ten (10) years 11 after the date geothermal steam is produced from the leased premises as determined by the Supervisor. Sec. 22. COOPERATIVE OR UNIT PLAN - The Lessee agrees that it will on its own, or at the request of the Lessor where it is determined to be necessary for the conservation of the resource or to prevent the waste of the resource, subscribe to and operate under any reasonable cooperative or unit plan for the development and operation of the, area, field, or pool, or part thereof embracing the lands subject to this lease as the Secretary may determine to be practicable and necessary or advisable in the interest of conservation. In the event the leased lands are included within a unit, the terms of this lease shall be deemed to be modified to conform to such unit agreement. Where any provision of a cooperative or unit plan of development which has been approved by the Secretary, and which by its terms affects the leased area or any part thereof, is inconsistent with a provision of this lease, the provisions of such cooperative or unit plan shall govern. Sec. 23. RELINQUISHMENT OF LEASE - The Lessee may relinquish this entire lease or any officially designated subdivision of the leased area in accordance with the regulations by filing in the proper BLM office a written relinquishment, in triplicate, which shall be effective as of the data of filing. No relinquishment of this lease or any portion of the leased area shall relieve the Lessee or its surety from any liability for breach of any obligation of this lease, including the obligation to make payment of all accrued rentals and royalties and to place all wells in the leased lands to be relinquished in condition for suspension or abandonment, and to protect or restore substantially the surface or subsurface resources in a manner satisfactory to the Lessor. Sec. 24. REMOVAL OF PROPERTY ON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF LEASE (a) Upon the termination or expiration of this lease in whole or in part, or the relinquishment of the lease in whole or in part, as herein provided, the Lessee shall within a period of ninety (90) days (or such longer period as the Supervisor may authorize because of adverse climatic conditions) thereafter remove from the leased lands, no longer subject to the lease all structures, machinery, equipment, tools, and materials in accordance with applicable regulations and orders of the Supervisor. However, the Lessee shall, for a period of not more then six (6) months, continue to maintain any such property needed in the relinquished area, as determined by the Supervisor, for producing wells or for drilling or producing geothermal resources on other leases. (b) Any structures, machinery, equipment, tools, appliances, and materials, subject to removal by the Lessee, as provided above, which are allowed to remain on the leased lands shall become the property of the Lessor on expiration of the 90-day period or any extension of that period which may be granted by the Supervisor. If the Supervisor 12 directs the Lessee to remove such property, the Lessee shall do so at its own expense, or if it fails to do so within a reasonable period, the Lessor may do so at the Lessee's expense. Sec. 25. REMEDIES IN CASE OF DEFAULT (a) Whenever the Lessee fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Act, or the terms and stipulations of this lease, or of the regulations issued under the Act, or of any order issued pursuant to those regulations, and that default shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after service of notice by the Lessor, the Lessor may (1) suspend operations until the requested action is taken to correct the noncompliance, or (2) cancel the lease in accordance with Sec. 12 of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1011). However, the 30-day notice provision applicable to this lease under Sec. 12 of the Act shall also apply as a prerequisite to the institution of any legal proceedings by the Lessor to cancel this lease while it is in a producing status. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to apply to, or require any notice with respect to any legal action instituted by the Lessor other than an action to cancel the lease pursuant to Sec. 12 of the Act. (b) Whenever the Lessee fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Act, or of this lease, or the regulations, or of any GRO Orders, or other orders, and immediate action is required, the Lessor without waiting for action by the Lessee may enter on the leased lends and take such measures as it may deem necessary to correct the failure, including a suspension of operations or production, all at the expense of the Lessee. (c) A waiver of any particular violation of the provisions of the Act, or of this lease, or of any regulations promulgated by the Secretary under the Act, shall not prevent the cancellation of this lease or the exercise of any other remedy or remedies under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section by reason of any other such violation, or for the same violation occurring at any other time. (d) Nothing herein shall limit or effect the Lessee's right to a hearing and appeal as provided in Sec. 12 of the Act and in the regulations promulgated thereunder. (e) Upon cancellation, the Lessee shall remove all property in accordance with Sec. 24 hereof, and shall restore the leased lands in a manner acceptable to the Lessor or as may be otherwise required by the Lessor. Sec. 26.

Sec. 22), as amended, and Sections 431, 432, and 433 of Title 18 of the United States Code, relating to contracts made or entered into, or accepted by or on behalf of the United States, form a part of this lease so far as the same may be applicable. Sec. 28. MONOPOLY AND FAIR PRICES - The Lessor reserves full power and authority to protect the public interest by promulgating and enforcing all orders necessary to insure the sale of the production from the leased lands at reasonable prices, to prevent monopoly, and to safeguard the public interest. Sec. 29. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY CLAUSE - The Lessee agrees that, during the performance of this contract: (1) The Lessee will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Lessee will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following: employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship.

[SEAL] JUN 11 1986 CERTIFIED TO BE A TRUE COPY /s/ Illegible - ---------------------------------------- CHIEF, RECORDS &amp; DATA ___. ___TION CALIFORNIA STATE OFFICE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT BOOK 1561 PAGE 815 The regulation in 43 CFR 3203.1-3(a) provides in pertinent part that &quot;If geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial quantities within the primary term of a lease, that lease shall continue for so long thereafter as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial quantities.... Production or utilization of geothermal steam in commercial quantities shall be deemed to include the completion of one or more wells producing or capable of producing geothermal steam in commercial quantities and a bona fide sale of such geothermal steam for delivery to or utilization by a facility or facilities not yet installed but scheduled for installation not later than 15 years from the date of commencement of the primary term of the lease....&quot; The regulations at 43 CFR 3203.1-4(c) further provide that &quot;A lease committed to a .... unit plan under or for which actual drilling operations were commenced prior to the end of the primary term of the lease, shall, if such operations are being diligently prosecuted at that time be extended for a period of five years and so long thereafter as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial quantities....&quot; The records disclose that both geothermal leases CA 966 and CA 1903, had completed wells capable of production prior to the expiration of their primary terms and were committed to a bona fide sales contract to sell the resource for delivery to or use by a facility that will operate and produce electricity within 15 years from the date the leases issued. Accordingly, geothermal leases CA 966 and CA 1903 are hereby extended to and including July 31, 1989, and so long thereafter as geothermal steam is produced or utilized in commercial quantities not to exceed 40 years after July 31, 1984. The request for extension of the primary term of geothermal lease CA 967 is herewith denied. Lease CA 967 did not contain a well capable of production as of the expiration of its primary term. In addition, this lease was not committed to an approved unit agreement for which there was a unit well either drilling or completed after the unit effective date and before the end of the lease's primary term. Accordingly, geothermal lease CA 967 is deemed to have terminated by operation of law on August 31, 1984. The request for extension of geothermal leases CA 6217 and CA 6218 is deemed to be premature at this time for the reason that these leases have four years remaining in their primary terms. Accordingly, the request for extension of leases CA 6217 and CA 6218 is denied at this time. The request for approval of assignments of geothermal leases CA 966, CA 1903, CA _217 and CA 6218 are herewith approved. The requests for approval of assignments affecting geothermal lease CA 967 are herewith denied for the reason that the lease is held to have terminated prior to the filing of such requests. If the applicant is adversely affected by this action, there is a right of appeal to the Board of Land Appeals, Office of the Secretary, in accordance with the regulations in 43 CFR, Part 4, Subpart _ . If an BOOK 1561 PAGE 816 appeal is taken, the notice of appeal must be filed in this office (not with the Board) so that the case file can be sent to the Board. A copy of the notice of appeal and of any statement of reasons, written arguments, or briefs must be served upon any adverse parties, and in addition, to the Regional Solicitor, Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Department of the Interior, 2800 Cottage Way, Room E-2841, Sacramento, California 95825, within 15 days of the filing of any specific document. If the procedures set forth in the regulations are not followed, an appeal is subject to dismissal. Form 1842-1 is enclosed for additional information. /s/ Joan B.
