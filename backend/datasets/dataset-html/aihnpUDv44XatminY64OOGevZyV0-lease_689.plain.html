          <p id="s1p236">1.2 Commencement Date. The “Commencement Date” shall be the date Landlord delivers possession of the Premises to Tenant in the condition required hereunder. No Base Rent (as hereinafter defined) or other rent or charges of any kind or nature, other than those charges described in Sections 6.1(b) and (c) shall be payable by Tenant with respect to the Premises until the Rent Commencement Date. The “Rent Commencement Date” shall be the earlier to occur of (i) Tenant’s Substantial Completion of the Tenant Improvements or (ii) six (6) months after the Commencement Date; provided, however, such six (6) month period shall be extended by one (1) day for each day Tenant’s Substantial Completion of the Tenant Improvements is actually delayed beyond such six (6) month period due to force majeure. As used herein, “Substantial Completion” shall mean the date that the Tenant Improvements are complete, subject only to minor punch-list items that do not interfere with Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, and Tenant has received all governmental permits and approvals required for the legal occupancy of the Premises for the use permitted hereunder, including a permanent certificate of occupancy. If Landlord fails to deliver possession of the Premises in the required condition within fifteen (15) days after execution of this Lease or Tenant fails to Substantially Complete the Tenant Improvements within six (6) months after Tenant’s</p>

          <p id="s1p337">10.1 Personal Property Taxes. Tenant shall pay prior to delinquency all taxes assessed against and levied upon trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property of Tenant contained in, on or about the Premises. When practicable, Tenant shall cause said trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property to be assessed and billed separately from the real property of Landlord. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that portions of Tenant’s personal property taxes may be subject to abatements pursuant to abatement agreements by and between Tenant and various taxing authorities.</p>

From and after the Rent Commencement Date only, Tenant agrees to pay an amount equal to the full value of Real Property Taxes levied upon the Land and the Premises as would otherwise be due from a non-exempt owner before the later of (i) thirty (30) days following Tenant’s receipt of the tax invoice, of (ii) the date such taxes would be delinquent. Landlord shall ensure that the Land will be assigned separate assessor parcel numbers and will not be assessed as part of any other real property owned by Landlord or other parties. “Real Property Taxes” means real estate taxes levied or assessed against the Premises and the Land as finally determined to be legally payable by legal proceedings after taking into account any available discount, excluding any interest or penalty for late payment. The term “Real Property Taxes” as used in this Lease shall be deemed to exclude any transfer, gift, succession, mortgage, capital stock, corporation, income or profit taxes, or Landlord’s gross profit tax, or any special assessment(s) for highway, street, or traffic control improvements, for sanitary or storm sewers, for utilities, or for other off-site improvements in connection with the development of the Premises where the work in connection with such off-site improvements shall have been commenced on or before the Commencement Date, or for any income, franchise, corporate, personal property, capital levy, capital stock, gross receipts, excess profits, transfer, revenue, estate, inheritance, gift, devolution or succession tax payable by Landlord, or any other tax or assessment upon, or measured by, the rent payable by Tenant hereunder. If any tax or assessment may be paid in installments under applicable laws, only the current annual installment for such tax or assessment shall be included within the meaning of the term “Real Property Taxes.” If Landlord shall actually receive a refund of real estate charges for any tax year in which Tenant has paid its proportionate share of real estate charges, Landlord shall refund Tenant’s proportionate share of such refund to Tenant, and this provision shall survive termination of this Lease. Tenant shall have the right to contest Real Property Taxes so long as Tenant indemnifies Landlord from any liability as a result thereof.</p>

Nothing in the foregoing sentence shall be construed to relieve Landlord of its obligations for the construction and maintenance of utility systems to the extent such construction is required pursuant to the terms of this Lease. If the Premises should become not reasonably suitable for Tenant’s use as a consequence of cessation of utilities or other services, interference with access to the Premises, legal restrictions or the presence of any Hazardous Material which does not result from the release or emission of such Hazardous Material by Tenant or its agents, employees or invitees, and in any of the foregoing cases the interference with Tenant’s use of the Premises persists for seven (7) days, then Tenant shall be entitled to an equitable abatement of rent to the extent of the interference with Tenant’s use of the Premises occasioned thereby.

Except as provided elsewhere herein, Tenant shall neither voluntarily nor by operation of law assign, sell or otherwise transfer all or any part of Tenant’s leasehold estate hereunder, without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Consent by Landlord to one or more assignments of this Lease shall not constitute a waiver of Landlord’s right to require consent to any future assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Tenant may, without Landlord’s prior written consent and without constituting an assignment or sublease hereunder, sublet the Premises or assign this Lease to (a) an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Tenant, (b) a successor entity related to Tenant by merger, consolidation, nonbankruptcy reorganization, or government action, or (c) a purchaser of substantially all of Tenant’s assets located in the Premises. A sale or transfer of Tenant’s capital stock shall not be deemed an assignment, subletting or any other transfer of this Lease or the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p346">12.2 Tenant’s Notice. Except as provided in Section 12.1 above, if Tenant desires at any time to assign this Lease, and if Landlord’s consent thereto is required pursuant to Section 12.1, then Tenant first shall notify Landlord of its desire to do so and shall submit in writing to Landlord (i) the name and legal composition of the proposed assignee; (ii) the nature of the proposed assignee’s business to be carried on in the Premises; and (iii) such reasonable business and financial information as Landlord may reasonably request concerning the proposed assignee. With respect to an assignment, the assignee must expressly assume all prospective obligations of Tenant under this Lease accruing after the assignment. Notwithstanding the assumption of the obligations of this Lease by the assignee, no assignment, even with the consent of Landlord, shall relieve Tenant of liability under this Lease. The obligations and liability of Tenant hereunder shall continue notwithstanding the fact that Landlord may accept rent and other performance from the assignee. The acceptance of rent by Landlord from any other person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease or to be a consent to any assignment.</p>

          <p id="s1p348">12.3 Restrictions on Subletting. Tenant may sublease all or portions of the Premises from time to time with the consent of Landlord, and Landlord shall give notice to Tenant of its consent or denial within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of reasonable information regarding the proposed sublessee. Such consent shall be in the reasonable discretion of the Landlord. Any such sublease shall be subject to the terms and provisions of this Lease. Without Landlord’s consent, Tenant may enter into license agreements with third party providers, to provide food or other services to Tenant’s employees. No sublessee shall have a right to further sublet without Landlord’s prior consent, such consent shall be in the reasonable discretion of the Landlord, and any assignment by a sublessee of the sublease shall be subject to Landlord’s prior consent in the same manner as if Tenant were entering into a new sublease. No sublease, once consented to by Landlord shall be modified or terminated by Tenant without Landlord’s prior consent, such consent being in the reasonable discretion of the Landlord.</p>

No such notice shall be deemed a forfeiture or a termination of this Lease unless Landlord so elects in the notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p359">13.3 Remedies of Landlord. Following any material default by Tenant as defined in Section 13.2 hereof which is not cured within the time set forth therein, and at any time thereafter prior to Tenant’s cure, and without limiting Landlord’s exercise of any right or remedy which Landlord may have in law or equity, Landlord shall have the right to: (i), terminate this Lease after giving Tenant thirty (30) days written notice of its intention to do so and in accordance with any laws governing such termination, and Tenant shall then surrender the Premises to Landlord; or (ii) enter and take possession of the Premises, in accordance with any laws governing such repossession, and remove Tenant, after having terminated the Lease; and / or (iii) declare all the rents and fees due or that shall be due under this Lease accelerated, such acceleration shall cause all such amounts to be immediately due and payable by Tenant. Landlord’s exercise of any of its remedies or its receipt of Tenant’s keys shall not be considered an acceptance or surrender of the Premises by Tenant. Landlord waives any right of distraint, distress for rent or Landlord’s lien that may arise at law.</p>
          <p id="s1p360">13.4 Landlord Defaults. If Landlord fails to perform any obligations under this Lease and such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days following the date of Tenant’s written notice to Landlord specifying such failure (or such longer period as may be reasonably necessary to cure such failure, as long as Landlord continues to exercise reasonable efforts to cure same) then in such event Tenant may, in addition to exercising any and all remedies available at law or in equity, perform such obligations on behalf of Landlord. If Landlord has not cured such default, Landlord will reimburse Tenant for all third party costs actually incurred by Tenant to cure such default, together with interest thereon at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. Tenant may act sooner in the event of an emergency involving imminent risk of death, personal injury or property damage as long as Tenant has first taken reasonable measures to notify Landlord, and once the emergency has come under control, permits Landlord to control any remaining corrective measures.</p>
          <p id="s1p361">13.5 Remedies Cumulative: No Waiver. All rights, options and remedies of Landlord and Tenant contained in this Lease shall be construed and held to be cumulative, and no one of then shall be exclusive of the other, and each party shall have the right to pursue any one or all of such remedies or any other remedy or relief which may be provided by law or in equity (including injunctive relief), whether or not stated in this Lease. No waiver of any default of either party hereunder shall be implied from any acceptance of any rent or other payments due hereunder or any omission by the non defaulting party to take any action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall affect defaults other than as specified in said waiver.
