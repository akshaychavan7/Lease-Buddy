          <p id="s1p2">LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p3">This Lease made as of the 29 day of October, 2010, between SHEVA 7 LLC, a New York limited liability company, having an office at 485 Seventh Avenue, Suite 777, New York, New York 10018, as landlord (“Landlord”), and I.C. ISAACS &amp; CO., INC., a Delaware Corporation, having an office at 252 West 37th Street, 6th floor, New York, NY 10018, as tenant (“Tenant”).</p>
          <p id="s1p4">W I T N E S S E T H :</p>
          <p id="s1p5">WHEREAS:</p>
          <p id="s1p6">1. Landlord is the owner of the building (the “Building”) at 252 West 37th Street, New York, New York. The Building together with the plot of land upon which it stands is referred to as the “Real Property”.</p>
          <p id="s1p7">2. Tenant desires to lease 10,500 rentable square feet on the Sixth (6th) floor of the Building indicated by outlining and diagonal markings on the floor plan annexed hereto as Exhibit 1 and designated as “Entire Sixth Floor” (excluding common areas) (the “Demised Premises”); and</p>
          <p id="s1p8">3. Landlord is willing to lease the Demised Premises to Tenant and Tenant is willing to enter into such lease all under the terms, covenants and conditions set forth herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p9">NOW,THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein the parties agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p10">FIRST: Grant of Lease and Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p11">A. Landlord does hereby grant to Tenant upon the terms and conditions of this Lease a lease to use the Demised Premises for a term (the “Term”) to commence on the earlier of the date of delivery of possession of the Premises to Tenant with the “Move In Items” (as specifically defined in Exhibit 4 of this Lease) substantially completed (the “Commencement Date”) and to end on the last day of the calendar month in which the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Commencement Date shall occur (the “Expiration Date”), unless the Term shall sooner terminate pursuant to any of the terms or conditions of this Lease or pursuant to law. Subject to delays that are caused by, or attributable to, (i) Tenant, its employees, agents and/or contractors (ii) unavailability of materials not within Landlord’s control, or (iii) to delays that fall under the provisions of Article 17th of this Lease, Landlord agrees and acknowledges that it shall deliver the Demised Premises as required herein on or before November 30, 2010, and that Tenant may commence its “move in” on November 26, 2010, it being understood that Landlord shall provide access to a freight elevator for Tenant’s “move in” at no charge to Tenant (except that in the event Tenant’s “move in” takes place during times which are not within Business Days (as such term is defined in Article 6th(C)), then, and in that event, Tenant shall be responsible to pay to Landlord reasonable charges in connection with such “move in” to the extent it takes place during such outside Business Days times, it being further understood by Tenant that such early “move in” is being provided as an accommodation that that throughout such “move in” Tenant shall not interfere with Landlord’s performance of Landlord’s Initial Work, including, without limitation, the “Move In Items”.</p>
          <p id="s1p12">B. In the event that Landlord fails to substantially complete the “Move In Items” (as specifically defined in Exhibit 4 of this Lease) by November 30, 2010, other than due to delays that are caused by, or attributable to, (i) Tenant, its employees, agents and/or contractors (ii) unavailability of materials not within Landlord’s control, or (iii) to delays that fall under the provisions of Article 17th of this Lease, and as a result of such failure, Tenant is unable to commence occupying the Demised Premises by November 30, 2010, then, and in such sole event, Landlord shall give Tenant a one time Fixed Rent credit equal to $75,000.00, the same to be applied against the next installment(s) of Fixed Rent to be due and payable, representing liquidated damages in connection with such failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties’ other rights and obligations under this Lease shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p13">C. To the extent any items of Landlord’s Initial Work are not completed on or before the Commencement Date, Landlord shall, acting in good faith, promptly commence (if not already commenced) and diligently prosecute to completion such items of Landlord’s Initial Work, with no unreasonable interference with Tenant’s business operations in the Demised Premises and, to the extent reasonably necessary and/or possible, shall perform such work after hours and on other than Business Days, if the performance of such items of Landlord’s Additional Work would unreasonably interfere with Tenant’s business operations in the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p14">1</p>
          <p id="s1p15">D. Tenant waives any right to terminate this Lease and/or recover any damages which may result from Landlord’s failure to deliver possession of the Demised Premises to Tenant on the Commencement Date, except that in the event Landlord cannot deliver the Demised Premises to Tenant with Landlord’s Initial Work substantially completed within one hundred five (105) days after mutual execution and delivery of this Lease for any reason, or for no reason, other than due to delays caused by Tenant or pursuant to Article 17th of this Lease, then, Tenant, as its sole and exclusive remedy hereunder, may terminate this Lease upon a ten (10) day written notice, and unless Landlord delivers the Demised Premises to Tenant before expiration of said ten (10) period, this Lease and the Term shall terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the date of such notice and except for those obligations which survive expiration of the Demised Term, neither party shall have any further obligation or liability under this Lease for any period after such effective termination date, except that Landlord shall return to Tenant the Security received and held under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p16">The term “Lease Year” shall mean (a) in the case of the initial Lease Year, a period beginning on the Commencement Date and ending on and including the last day of the calendar month in which the first (1E.st) anniversary of the Commencement Date occurs, and (b) for any subsequent Lease Year, the one-year period beginning on the day immediately following the expiration of the immediately preceding Lease Year and ending on the anniversary of the last day of the immediately preceding Lease Year, except that the final Lease Year shall end on the Expiration Date.</p>

Fixed Rent shall be payable in advance on the first (1st) day of each month of the Term without prior demand therefore and without any offset, abatement or deduction whatsoever. Landlord shall have all of the rights and remedies at law to collect Fixed Rent and shall be paid in lawful money of the United States.</p>
          <p id="s1p28">(C) Each of Landlord and Tenant acknowledges that in lieu of an operating expense or porters’ wage escalation, commencing on the first anniversary of the Commencement Date and on every anniversary of the Commencement Date thereafter, the Fixed Rent provided for above has been increased per annum on a compounded basis.</p>

          <p id="s1p31">THIRD: Use.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">(A) The Demised Premises shall be used by Tenant solely as general and executive offices and showroom and for no other purpose. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that no representations have been made to Tenant with respect to the use, if any, to which the Demised Premises may be put.</p>
          <p id="s1p33">(B) Tenant shall not use or occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of the Demised Premises or any part thereof, for any purpose other than the purpose specifically set forth in Paragraph A of this Article THIRD, or in any manner which, in Landlord’s judgment (a) shall adversely affect or interfere with (i) any services required to be provided by Landlord to Tenant or to any other tenant or occupant of the Building, or (ii) the proper and economical rendition of any such service, or (iii) the use or enjoyment or any part of the Building by any other tenant or occupant, and/or (b) shall tend to impair the character or dignity of the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">(C) In the event the Demised Premises contain a glass entry door, Tenant shall make sure not to have any packing crates, boxes or other related materials visible from the outside through said glass door. No signs shall be allowed on the windows of the Demised Premises without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned or unduly delayed.</p>
          <p id="s1p35">3</p>
          <p id="s1p36">FOURTH: Alterations.</p>
          <p id="s1p37">(A) Tenant shall not make (or permit any other party to make) any changes, additions, improvements, alterations or other physical changes to the Demised Premises, the Building or any portions thereof, or any of the systems therein or thereon (referred to collectively as “Alterations” and singly as an “Alteration”) without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (and if not consented to or denied within twenty (20) days after written notice from Tenant shall be deemed approved), and in the event that Landlord grants such consent, such Alteration shall be made in compliance with all Legal Requirements and performed in a manner and at such times as Landlord reasonably designates and such Alterations or installations shall not, in any event, interfere with the use and operation of the Building by Landlord or any tenant, occupant or user thereof; provided, however, that if any such Alteration shall relates to interior cosmetic non-structural work or does not affect the Building structure or systems and does not exceed in cost the sum of $25,000 in the aggregate over a ninety (90) day period, Landlord’s consent shall not be required. Without limiting the aforesaid, Tenant agrees that (a) prior to making any Alterations or installing of any of Tenant’s equipment in the Demised Premises, Tenant shall submit detailed plans and specifications of the planned Alteration or installation to Landlord for Landlord’s approval, provided that in no event will Landlord’s approval of such plans be deemed a representation that they comply with applicable Legal Requirements, and any such Alterations shall be made only in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by Landlord, and (b) all contractors performing any Alterations, modification or maintenance work on behalf of Tenant at the Demised Premises or in the Building shall be subject to the prior written approval of Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned or unduly delayed and if, not consented to or denied within twenty (20) days, shall be deemed approved, prior to the commencement of such work. In the event Landlord or its agents employ any independent architect or engineer to examine any plans or specifications submitted by Tenant to Landlord in connection with any proposed Alteration, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord any reasonable out-of-pocket fees incurred by Landlord in connection therewith. Nothing in this Lease shall be construed in any way as constituting the consent or request of Landlord, express or implied, by inference or otherwise, to any contractor, subcontractor, laborer or material men, for the performance of any labor or the furnishing of any material for any specific Alteration to, or repair of, the Demised Premises, the Building, or any part thereof. Any mechanic’s or other lien filed against the Building, or the Real Property, for work claimed to have been done for, or materials claimed to have been furnished to, Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant or based upon any act or omission or alleged act or omission of Tenant or any such person shall be discharged by Tenant (by bond or otherwise) at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, within thirty (30) days after notice to Tenant of the filing of such lien. In addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall comply in all respects with the rules and regulations attached hereto as Exhibit 2 in connection with any Alterations at the Demised Premises; provided, however, that such rules and regulations are not discriminatorily applied to Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p38">(B) Upon completion of any Alterations, Tenant, at Tenant’s expense, shall obtain certificates of final approval of such Alterations required by any governmental authority, if required, and shall furnish Landlord with copies thereof, together with the “as-built” plans and specifications for such Alterations, which “as-built” plans shall be in hard copy and diskette form. All Alterations shall be made and performed in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor as approved by Landlord, all legal requirements and the Rules and Regulations. All materials and equipment to be incorporated in the Demised Premises as a result of any Alterations shall be of quality equal to the then existing conditions and no such materials or equipment shall be subject to any lien, encumbrance, chattel mortgage, title retention or security agreement. In addition, no such changes for which the cost of labor and materials (as estimated by Landlord’s architect, engineer or contractor) is in excess of One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars, shall be undertaken prior to Tenant’s delivering to Landlord such security for timely lien-free completion thereof as is reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, and such Alterations shall be performed only under the supervision of a licensed architect reasonably satisfactory to Landlord. In addition, other than with respect to Tenant’s initial Alterations, Alterations which are estimated to exceed $100,000 shall be subject to a supervisory fee which Tenant shall pay to Landlord in full prior to the commencement of such Alterations. Such fee shall be equal to five percent (5%) of the estimated hard cost of Alterations.</p>
          <p id="s1p39">(C) All Alterations made by or on behalf of Tenant shall upon installation become the property of Landlord and shall remain and be surrendered with the Demised Premises unless Landlord, by notice to Tenant given no later than 30 days prior to the date fixed as the termination of this Lease elects to relinquish Landlord’s rights thereto and have them removed by Tenant, in which event Tenant shall remove same from the Demised Premises, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, prior to the Expiration Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p40">4</p>
          <p id="s1p41">FIFTH: Repairs and Maintenance. Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain and take good care of (i) the Demised Premises and all fixtures, installations and appurtenances contained therein and (ii) Tenant’s personal property and equipment, and all replacements and additions thereto and Tenant shall make all repairs, structural or otherwise (it being understood that structural repairs shall be Tenant’s responsibility to pay or reimburse Landlord for only to the extent attributable to acts and/or negligence of Tenant, its employees, agents and/or invitees), foreseen or unforeseen as and when needed to keep the Demised Premises, and Tenant’s personal property and equipment in good order and repair. Landlord shall have no obligation to maintain, repair, operate or safeguard Tenant’s equipment. Landlord shall be responsible for structural repairs and repairs to all utility systems serving the Demised Premises and the Building (including, without limitation, the roof, exterior walls, structural elements and utility and other Building systems), unless such repairs are attributable to acts and/or negligence of Tenant, its employees, agents and/or invitees.</p>
          <p id="s1p42">SIXTH: Utilities and Services.</p>
          <p id="s1p43">(A) Electric Current.</p>
          <p id="s1p44">(1) Landlord shall furnish electrical energy to or for the use of Tenant in the Demised Premises for the operation of lighting fixtures and standard office equipment, or as Landlord shall otherwise permit to be installed in the Demised Premises, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned or unduly delayed, through the feeders, wiring installations and facilities heretofore installed in the Building and, to the extent not previously installed, shall install one (1) submeter to measure Tenant’s consumption of electrical energy (including that furnished for air conditioning to the Demised Premises). Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent hereunder, on demand made from time to time but no more frequently than monthly, for its use of electrical energy in the Demised Premises as evidenced by the aforesaid submeter(s), based upon both consumption and demand factors, at the average rate then payable by Landlord to the Utility Company (as defined below), plus an amount equal to five percent (5%) thereof to reimburse Landlord for its overhead, administration, and supervision in connection therewith. For purposes of this Article SIXTH, the rate to be paid by Tenant shall include any taxes, energy charges, demand charges, fuel adjustment charges, rate adjustment charges, or other charges actually imposed in connection therewith. If any tax is imposed upon Landlord’s receipts from the sale or resale of electrical energy to Tenant by any federal, state, city or local authority, the pro-rata share of such tax allocable to the electrical energy service received by Tenant shall be passed onto and paid by Tenant as Additional Rent if and to the extent permitted by law. Tenant expressly acknowledges that the electricity for the hot-water heater providing hot water to the lavatory of the Demised Premises shall be measured on Tenant’s submeter(s) and, accordingly, that all electrical charges therefor shall be paid by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p45">(2) If either the quantity or character of electrical service is changed by the public utility corporation supplying electrical service to the Building (the “Utility Company”) or is no longer available or suitable for Tenant’s requirements, no such change, unavailability or unsuitability unless resulting from the intentional acts (or refusals to act) or gross negligence of Landlord, shall constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Landlord or Landlord’s agents.</p>
          <p id="s1p46">(3) Tenant covenants that at no time shall the use of electrical energy in the Demised Premises exceed the capacity of the existing feeders or wiring installations then serving the Demised Premises. In furtherance of the foregoing and to avert any possible adverse effect upon the Building’s electrical system, Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, make or perform, or permit the making or performing of, any alteration to connections, capacity risers, switches, wiring installations or other electrical facilities in or serving the Demised Premises. If Tenant requires additional electrical capacity, Landlord shall, subject to this paragraph C and in particular to Landlord’s approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, provide additional capacity at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, provided such additional capacity shall be permitted by all laws, rules and regulations and shall not have an adverse effect upon the Building’s electrical system or the availability of adequate electrical capacity for the other occupants thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p47">(4) Landlord may, at any time, elect to discontinue the furnishing of electrical energy. In the event of any such election by Landlord (a) Landlord agrees to give not less than 60 days advance notice of any such discontinuance to Tenant, (b) Landlord agrees to permit Tenant to receive electrical service directly from the Utility Company supplying electrical service to the Building and to permit the existing feeders, risers, wiring and other electrical facilities serving the Premises to be used by Tenant for such purpose to the extent they are available, suitable and safely capable, (c) Landlord agrees, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, (i) to install any necessary electrical meter equipment and (ii) to perform any necessary rewiring, and (d) this Lease shall remain in full force and effect and such discontinuance shall not constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent except as expressly provided in this Subsection, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Landlord. Landlord agrees not to discontinue the furnishing of electric energy to Tenant unless Landlord discontinues the furnishing of electric energy to each of the similarly situated tenants of the Building nor to effectuate such discontinuance unless and until alternate sources of electric energy are then available to Tenant in the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p48">5</p>
          <p id="s1p49">(B) Elevators. If all or any portion of the Demised Premises is located on other than the ground floor of the Building, Landlord, at Landlord’s expense, shall have a passenger elevator subject to call at all times. Landlord shall not be required to furnish any operator service for automatic elevators. If Landlord shall, at any time, elect to furnish operator service for any automatic elevators, Landlord shall have the right to discontinue furnishing such service with the same effect as if Landlord had never elected to furnish such service.</p>
          <p id="s1p50">(C) Heat. Landlord, at Landlord’s expense, shall furnish heat to the Demised Premises, as and when required by law, on business days from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M (“Business Days”).</p>
          <p id="s1p51">(D) Air Conditioning and Ventilation. Landlord will provide and install a 24-hr, Tenant controlled, air-cooled package A/C unit, not subject to Building hours or any restrictions, other than as specifically provided herein or under applicable law. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall be required to maintain a service contract for the maintenance and repair of the HVAC system in the Premises. If said HVAC System is not a new system with all normal and customary guarantees and warrantees being obtained for Tenant’s benefit, Landlord shall make all repairs and replacements to the compressor and other major portions of the HVAC System unless such repairs and replacements are attributable to acts and/or negligence of Tenant, its employees, agents and/or invitees.</p>
          <p id="s1p52">(E) Cleaning. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense, keep the Demised Premises, including the inside portion of the windows, clean and in good order, to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord, and for that purpose shall employ the person or persons, corporation or other entity reasonably approved by Landlord, it being understood that Tenant may use its own employees to clean the Demised Premises. All portions of the Demised Premises used for the storage, preparations, service or consumption of food or beverages shall be cleaned daily and exterminated against infestation by vermin, roaches and rodents regularly and, in addition, whenever there shall be evidence of any infestation.</p>
          <p id="s1p53">(F) Water. If Tenant requires, uses or consumes water for any purpose in addition to ordinary lavatory and pantry purposes, Landlord may install a water meter and thereby measure Tenant’s water consumption for all purposes. Tenant shall pay Landlord for the cost of the meter and the cost of the installation thereof and throughout the duration of Tenant’s occupancy Tenant shall keep said meter installation equipment in good working order and repair at Tenant’s own cost and expense, in default of which Landlord may cause such meter and equipment to be replaced or repaired and collect the cost thereof from Tenant as Additional Rent. Tenant agrees to pay for water consumed, as shown on said meter as and when bills are rendered, and on default in making such payment Landlord may pay such charges and collect the same from Tenant as Additional Rent. Tenant covenants and agrees to pay the water, sewer rent, charge or any other tax, rent, levy or charge which now or hereafter is assessed, imposed or a lien upon the Demised Premises or the realty of which they are a part pursuant to law, order or regulation made or issued in connection with the use, consumption, maintenance or supply of water, water system or sewage or sewage connection or system. The parties agree that such charges are currently One Hundred and Nine and 38/100 ($109.38)Dollars per month, but that they may be reasonably increased by Landlord, from time to time, to reflect increases pursuant to applicable law. The bills rendered hereunder by the Landlord shall be payable by Tenant as Additional Rent. Independently of and in addition to any of the remedies reserved to Landlord hereinabove or elsewhere in this Lease, Landlord may sue for and collect any monies to be paid by Tenant or paid by Landlord for any of the reasons or purposes hereinabove set forth.</p>
          <p id="s1p54">6</p>
          <p id="s1p55">(G) Overtime Periods; Service Failure. The Fixed Rent does not reflect or include any charge to Tenant for the furnishing or distributing of any necessary elevator facilities, heat, conditioned air or mechanical ventilation to the Demised Premises during periods (referred to as “Overtime Periods”) other than the hours and days set forth above in this Article for the furnishing and distributing of such services. Accordingly, if Landlord shall furnish any such elevator facilities, heat, conditioned air or mechanical ventilation to the Demised Premises at the request of Tenant during Overtime Periods, Tenant shall pay Landlord for such services at the standard rates then fixed by Landlord for the Building or, if no such rates are then fixed, at reasonable rates determined by Landlord in Landlord’s sole discretion. Landlord shall not be required to furnish any such services during Overtime Periods, unless Landlord has received reasonable advance notice from Tenant requesting such services. Regardless of whether Tenant gives Landlord reasonable advance notice requesting such services during any Overtime Periods, failure by Landlord to furnish or distribute any such services during such Overtime Periods, or failure of Landlord to distribute any such services during business hours on business days, shall not constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Landlord or its agents by reason of inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or injury to or interruption of Tenant’s business or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p56">(H) Sprinklers. Anything elsewhere in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, if the New York Board of Fire Underwriters or the New York Fire Insurance Exchange or any bureau, department or official of the federal, state or city government require the installation of a sprinkler system or that any changes, modifications, alterations, or additional sprinkler heads or other equipment be made or supplied in an existing sprinkler system by reason of Tenant’s business or the location of partitions, trade fixtures or other contents of the Demised Premises, Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense, promptly make such sprinkler system installations, changes, modifications, alterations and supply additional sprinkler heads or other equipment as required whether the work involved shall be structural or non-structural in nature. In addition, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent the sum of One Hundred and Nine and 38/100 ($109.38)Dollars on the first day of each month during the term of this Lease, as Tenant’s portion of the contract price for sprinkler supervisory service.</p>
          <p id="s1p57">(I) Rubbish Removal. Landlord or its designated agent shall on Business Days only, and at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, remove or cause to be removed from the Demised Premises and the Building, Tenant’s refuse and rubbish on Business Days only. By 5:00 PM on Business Days, Tenant shall deposit such rubbish in a sealed receptacle in the lobby next to the freight elevator on the floor of the Building on which the Demised Premises are located in a location designated by Landlord. The charge for such service shall be paid by Tenant directly to “Landlord’s garbage removal vendor” (as such term is hereinafter defined) as Additional Rent on demand, the garbage removal charges for the Demised Premises at the garbage removal vendor’s then established rates for the Building. In the event that Tenant requires garbage removal services other than ordinary daily trash removal, Tenant can request Landlord to provide additional garbage removal services at the Landlord’s vendor’s then established rates for the Building. Such removal of the refuse and rubbish shall be subject to such rules and regulations, as in the reasonable judgment of Landlord, are necessary for the proper operation of the Building. In addition, any removal of “in bulk” debris by Landlord or its agent shall be done for a reasonable additional charge as determined and billed by Landlord or its garbage removal vendor [and such sums shall be paid by Tenant directly to Landlord or Landlord’s garbage removal vendor (at Landlord’s option) as Additional Rent on demand in addition to all the other sums payable under this Article]. Tenant shall at its sole cost and expense comply with any and all recycling rules and regulations as required by any municipal authority or applicable legal requirements. For purposes of this Lease, the “Landlord’s garbage removal vendor” shall mean the Building’s approved cleaning contractor. If there shall, at any time, be more than one garbage disposal vendor in the Building, Tenant shall have the right to choose which of such vendors it uses.</p>

Landlord agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts not to unreasonably delay the prompt commencement and diligent completion of any such repairs, replacements and improvements and, to the extent commercially reasonably possible, cause the same to be made with the least possible inconvenience to Tenant. The exercise of such right by Landlord shall not constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Landlord or its agents by reason of inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or injury to or interruption of Tenant’s business, or otherwise.</p>

          <p id="s1p65">(C) Landlord’s Initial Work shall be equal to standards adopted by Landlord for the Building and otherwise at per the plan attached herein, and shall constitute a single, non-recurring obligation on the part of Landlord and shall be completed on or about the Commencement Date (provided Landlord’s failure to complete Landlord’s Initial Work by the Commencement Date shall not, except as herein specifically provided, affect the Commencement Date or date upon which rent commences). In the event this Lease or the Term is renewed or extended for a further term by agreement or operation of law, Landlord’s obligation to perform such work shall not apply to such renewal or extension.</p>
          <p id="s1p66">(D) So long as the same does not excessive inconvenience to Tenant. Landlord may enter the Demised Premises to perform the foregoing work and installations, and entry by Landlord, its agents, servants, employees or contractors for such purpose shall not constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of rent, or relieve Tenant form any of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Landlord, or its agents, by reason of inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant, or injury to, or interruption of Tenant’s business or otherwise. Landlord shall, as a part of Landlord’s Initial Work, cause the windows in the Demised Premises to be washed, inside and outside and all windows placed in good working order .</p>
          <p id="s1p67">(E) Tenant shall not interfere with construction and/or construction crew members and/or any contractors used by Landlord and shall communicate in writing and only with Landlord’s authorized personnel regarding said construction.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Landlord’s reasonable rules and regulations, Tenant shall be entitled to enter into the Demised Premises for the purpose of installing telephone and other cabling and to perform such other minor items of construction that will not interfere with Landlord’s Initial Work, without the same constituting its acceptance of the Demised Premises.</p>

Tenant shall not sublet the Demised Premises (or any portion thereof), or permit anyone to use or occupy the Demised Premises (or any portion thereof) without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned or unduly delayed (but subject to the conditions set forth in Article Ninth(C). No assignment of this Lease shall relieve Tenant of its obligations hereunder and, subsequent to any assignment, Tenant’s liability hereunder shall continue notwithstanding any subsequent modification or amendment hereof or the release of any subsequent tenant hereunder from any liability.</p>
          <p id="s1p76">9</p>
          <p id="s1p77">(B) Tenant shall have the right, without the prior consent of Landlord, to permit the use or occupancy of all or any part of the Demised Premises by any subsidiary or affiliate of Tenant named herein for the use permitted in this Lease only for such period as it shall remain such subsidiary or affiliate.

No such use or occupancy shall operate to vest in the user or occupant any right or interest in this Lease or the Demised Premises.</p>

Landlord may accept such offer by notice to Tenant given within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice from Tenant. Failure of Landlord to so notify Tenant within said thirty (30) day period, time being of the essence as to such date, shall be deemed to be a rejection by Landlord of such offer. If Landlord accepts such offer, (i) the Expiration Date shall be deemed to mean the Surrender Date, and Tenant shall vacate and surrender to Landlord all of Tenant’s right, title and interest in and to the entire Demised Premises, on the Surrender Date, and the same shall be delivered to Landlord in broom clean condition, free and clear of all tenancies and occupancies and (ii) in the event Tenant fails to timely and properly surrender and vacate the Demised Premises to Landlord on the Surrender Date, the same shall constitute a holdover and be subject to the term of Article EIGHTH hereof.

All sums payable hereunder by Tenant shall be paid to Landlord as Additional Rent immediately upon receipt thereof by Tenant (or any affiliate, parent or subsidiary or principal of Tenant) and if requested by Landlord, Tenant and the assignee or subtenant, as the case may be, shall promptly enter into a written agreement with Landlord setting forth the amount of Additional Rent to be paid to Landlord pursuant to this Article NINTH.

          <p id="s1p83">(4) there shall be no default by Tenant under any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease at the time that Landlord’s consent to any such assignment or subletting is requested (it being understood, however, that Tenant’s cure of such default prior to effective date of the assignment or the proposed sublease shall be deemed compliance herein) and on the effective date of the assignment or the proposed sublease;</p>

          <p id="s1p86">(7) the Demised Premises shall not, without Landlord’s prior consent, have been publicly listed or publicly advertised for subletting at a rental rate less than the prevailing rental rate set by Landlord for primary space in the Building;</p>
          <p id="s1p87">(8) such proposed subletting shall not result in there being more than four (4) occupants in the Demised Premises (including Tenant) at any one time, and Tenant shall be responsible for making any alterations to the Demised Premises to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), as a result of such subletting;</p>

          <p id="s1p108">(C) Anything in Sections (A) and (B) above to the contrary notwithstanding, Landlord’s obligation to repair and restore the Demised Premises shall (I) be limited to the mechanical and structural elements of the Building and the outer walls, ceiling and floor of the Demised Premises and Landlord’s Initial Work, it being understood that (i) Tenant alone shall be required to repair and restore all betterments and improvements (including Tenant’s Alterations) and all personal property of Tenant in the Demised Premises, with reasonable dispatch after any casualty, and (ii) Fixed Rent and Additional Rent shall cease as to all or any portion of the Demised Premises following a casualty affecting the Demised Premises only until such time as Landlord shall have repaired and restored the foregoing elements of the Demised Premises for which Landlord is responsible to the limited extent hereinabove set forth and (II) not commence until Landlord has received actual proceeds.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">THIRTEENTH: Indemnity and Insurance.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">(A) Tenant covenants and agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless Landlord, Eretz Group, LLC, and each of their agents, and the agents, servants and employees of each of the foregoing and such other entities as may be designated by the Landlord (individually, “Indemnitee” and collectively the “Indemnitees”) from and against each and every claim, demand, cause of action, liability, cost, damage, loss, penalty, fine, judgment or expense (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in defense of the Indemnitees) which (i) may be made, asserted, brought or recovered by any person, firm or corporation arising out of any death or bodily or personal injury (including sickness or disease) or any damage to property to the extent caused by, resulting from or in any way directly or indirectly incidental to or in connection with the use of the Demised Premises or the operation of the Tenant’s equipment, and/or any act, omission or negligence of Tenant and its agents contractors or employees and (ii) shall arise or result from or be incurred in connection with or in any way be incidental to (1) any material breach by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease or (2) any violation of any Legal Requirement or any fine, penalty or governmental order issued to or enforced against Landlord or any Indemnitee by any relevant Governmental Authority with regard to such violation; the term “expense” shall include, but not be limited to, any reasonable attorneys’ fees or expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with the aforesaid and attorneys’ fees or expenses incurred in connection with any action to recover such attorneys’ fees or expenses. The obligations of Tenant hereunder shall survive the expiration, cancellation or termination of this Lease and the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">14</p>
          <p id="s1p112">(B) Tenant shall obtain and keep in full force and effect during the Term at its own cost and expense (i) insurance against loss or damage by fire and other casualty to all betterments and improvements and all personal property of Tenant in the Demised Premises, under then available standard forms of “all-risk” insurance policies, in an amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the replacement value thereof, with such commercially reasonable deductible(s), not to exceed $50,000, as may be determined by Tenant in its reasonable discretion, (ii) commercial general liability insurance with a broad form liability endorsement including coverage for contractual liability, and (iii) business income (interruption) insurance in such amounts as Landlord shall reasonably require but in no event less than an amount equal to the sum of (a) Fixed Rent plus (b) estimated Additional Rent, payable for the then Lease Year occurring during the Term. Said commercial general liability insurance shall provide coverage on an occurrence basis with a minimum limit of liability of (u) (I) $1,000,000 per occurrence for bodily injury (including death), single limit liability and (II) $1,000,000 for bodily injury (including death) in any one occurrence; and (2) $500,000 per occurrence in respect of property damage (including, without limitation, water damage and sprinkler leakage legal liability). Said commercial general liability insurance is to be written without the inclusion of any defense costs within the limit of liability, and shall name Landlord and Landlord’s managing agent, Eretz Group, LLC, LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Trustee for those certain Bear Stearns Commercial Mortgage Securities Inc., Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-Top 16 C/O Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and ARBOR SR WEST 35TH LLC c/o Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC and any other Superior Mortgagee (which Tenant has received written notice of) as additional insureds and Tenant as insured, against any and all claims for bodily injury (including death), personal injury, or property damage. All of the aforesaid insurance and the Extra Insurance coverage shall be written in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord by one or more good and solvent insurance companies of recognized standing admitted to do business in the State of New York, rated by A.M. Best Co., Inc., or any successor thereto (or if there be none, an organization having a national reputation) as having a “Best’s Rating” of at least “A-” and a financial size of at least “Class IX.” Tenant shall pay all premiums and charges therefor and upon failure to do so, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, make such payments, in which event Tenant agrees to pay the amount thereof to Landlord on demand, as Additional Rent. An appropriate certificate on an Acord Form 27 evidencing the aforesaid insurance coverage shall be delivered to Landlord, together with (i) evidence that such insurance is in full force and effect and the premiums therefor have been paid in full, and (ii) any endorsements thereto, simultaneously with Tenant’s initial delivery to Landlord of this Lease, as executed by Tenant, and thereafter renewals or replacements thereof shall be delivered to Landlord at least 15 business days prior to the expiration of any expiring policy (in each case evidencing that all such insurance is in full force and effect and the premiums therefor have been paid in full). Such insurance policy shall contain a provision that no act or omission of Tenant or Landlord or Landlord’s managing agent will affect or limit the obligation of the insurance company to pay the amount of any loss sustained and that the insurance afforded thereunder shall not be canceled, nonrenewed, modified or coverage thereunder reduced except upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Landlord. The proceeds of policies providing “all risk” property insurance for Tenant’s property, betterments and improvements shall be payable to Landlord, Tenant and the holder of each Superior Mortgage and Superior Lease, as their interests may appear. Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in connection with the collection of any insurance monies that may be due in the event of loss and Tenant shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord such proofs of loss and other instruments which may be required to recover any such insurance monies. In the event Tenant shall fail to obtain such insurance, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, obtain the same, in which event the amount of the premium paid shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord upon demand as Additional Rent. Landlord shall also have the right, at any time and from time to time during the Demised Term on not less than fifteen (15) days’ notice to Tenant, to require that Tenant increase the amounts and/or kinds of coverage required to be maintained under this Article THIRTEENTH to the amounts and/or kinds of coverages then required by landlords of comparable buildings in the area in which the Demised Premises are located.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">(C) Each party agrees to use its good faith efforts to include in each of its policies insuring against loss, damage or destruction by fire, a waiver of the insurer’s right of subrogation against the other party in connection with any loss or damage covered by any such policy or permission to release third parties from liability resulting from such casualties. If such waiver or permission shall not be, or shall cease to be, obtainable without additional charge or at all, the insured party shall promptly so notify the other party. In any case in which such waiver or permission shall cease to be obtainable without additional charge, if the other party shall so elect and shall pay the insurer’s additional charge therefor, such waiver or permission shall be included in the policy.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">(D) Each party hereby releases the other party, its partners, agents and employees with respect to any claim (including a claim for negligence) which it might otherwise have against the other party, its partners, agents or employees for loss, damage or destruction with respect to its property (including rental value or business interruption) occurring during the Demised Term but only if and to the extent to which (assuming no deductibles) such party is covered under a policy of collectible insurance containing a waiver of subrogation provision or permission as provided in Article TWELFTH hereof or this Article THIRTEENTH. If notwithstanding the recovery of insurance proceeds by either party for loss, damage or destruction of its property (or rental value or business interruption) the other party is liable to the first party with respect thereto or is obligated under this Lease to make replacement, repair or restoration, then provided the first party’s right of full recovery under its insurance policies is not thereby prejudiced or otherwise adversely affected, the amount of the net proceeds of the first party’s insurance against such loss, damage or destruction shall be offset against the second party’s liability to the first party therefor, or shall be made available to the second party to pay for replacement, repair or restoration, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p115">15</p>
          <p id="s1p116">(E) The waiver of subrogation or permission referred to in Subsections (C) and (D) of this Article shall extend to the partners, agents and employees of each party and, in the case of Tenant, shall also extend to all other permitted occupants of the Demised Premises, but only if and to the extent that such waiver or permission can be obtained without additional charge (unless such party shall pay such charge). Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to relieve either party from any duty imposed elsewhere in this Lease to repair, restore or rebuild or to nullify any abatement of Fixed Rent provided for elsewhere in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p117">(F) Any employee of the Building to whom property shall be entrusted by or on behalf of Tenant shall be deemed to be acting as Tenant’s agent with respect to such property and neither Landlord nor its agents shall be liable for any damage to such property nor for the loss of or damage to any property of Tenant by theft or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">FOURTEENTH: Subordination. This Lease and all of Tenant’s rights hereunder shall remain, subject and subordinate in all respects to all ground or underlying leases now or hereafter in effect and to all mortgages which may now or hereafter affect such leases and/or the Building and/or the Real Property, and to all advances made or hereafter to be made under such mortgages, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, correlations, replacements and extensions of, and substitutions for, such leases and mortgages. The foregoing provisions of this Article shall be self-operative and no further instrument of subordination shall be required. Tenant hereby agrees to modify this Lease to incorporate any reasonable modifications to this Lease requested by a Mortgagee of the Building and/or Real Property provided the same does not increase the obligations of Tenant hereunder (other than to an immaterial extent) or decease the obligations of Landlord hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p119">FIFTEENTH: Landlord Liability Limitation. Landlord shall incur no liability of any kind whatsoever to Tenant or to any person, firm or corporation claiming by, through or under Tenant in connection with this Lease or the revocation thereof, or the use by Tenant of all or any portions of the Demised Premises or the Building. Landlord shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss or damage that may occur to Tenant’s property or effects while located in the Demised Premises or the Building unless such damage is due to the negligence of Landlord. No general or limited partner, officer, director, employee or shareholder of Landlord or any agent thereof shall be personally liable for the performance of Landlord’s obligation under this Lease. The liability of any Landlord’s obligation under this Lease shall be limited to Landlord’s equity interest in the Building, and Tenant shall not look to any of Landlord’s other assets for enforcement or satisfaction of any such obligation, nor shall Tenant seek recourse for such enforcement or satisfaction against any general or limited partner, member, officer, director, employee or shareholder of Landlord or any agent thereof. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that (i) Landlord shall not be obligated to provide security or any other type of protection for any equipment, personal property or installation in the Demised Premises, (ii) neither Landlord nor its agents shall be liable or responsible to Tenant for any loss or damage to any property or person occasioned by theft, fire, act of God, public enemy, injunction, riot, strike, insurrection, war, act of terrorism, court order, requisition or other order of governmental body or authority, or for any damage or inconvenience which may arise through maintenance, repair or alteration of any part of the Building. Landlord and Tenant agree that (except for a holdover by Tenant or someone claiming through or under Tenant) neither party shall be liable to the other for any special or consequential damages, including lost profits or revenues, as a result of such parties’ default of its obligations under this Lease, provided that nothing contained herein shall otherwise limit, modify or violate any claim or remedy in law or equity by one party hereof against the other by reason of a breach or default in the other’s obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p120">SIXTEENTH: Default/Remedies.</p>
          <p id="s1p121">(A) If at any time prior to or during the Term, any one or more of the following events (referred to as “Events of Default”) shall occur: (i) if Tenant shall default in the payment when due of any installment of Fixed Rent or in the payment when due of any other sums due Landlord hereunder, and such default shall continue for a period of five (5) days after notice by Landlord to Tenant of such default, or (ii) if Tenant shall default in the observance or performance of any term, covenant or condition (other than the covenants to make payment of Fixed Rent or other sums due Landlord) of this Lease on Tenant’s part to be observed or performed and Tenant shall fail to remedy such default within thirty (30) days after notice by Landlord to Tenant of such default; or (iii) if Tenant shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, or such proceeding shall be commenced against Tenant or Tenant shall be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or Tenant shall file or there shall be filed against Tenant any petition or answer seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under present or any future federal bankruptcy act or any other present or future applicable federal, state or other statute or law, or Tenant shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or Tenant shall seek or consent to or acquiesce in the appointment of any trustee, receiver or liquidator for Tenant or of all or any part of Tenant’s property; or (iv) intentionally omitted; or (v) if Tenant shall desert or abandon the Demised Premises or Tenant’s equipment; or (vi) if Tenant’s interest in this Lease shall devolve upon or pass to any person, whether by operation of law or otherwise except as provided in Article NINTH hereof then, upon the occurrence, at any time prior to or during the Term, of any one or more of such Events of Default, Landlord, at any time thereafter, at Landlord’s option, may give to Tenant a five (5) days’ notice of termination of this Lease and, in the event such notice is given, this Lease and the Term shall come to an end and expire upon the expiration of said five (5) days with the same effect as if the date of expiration of said five (5) days were the expiration date of the Term and this Lease, but Tenant shall remain liable for damages and all other sums payable pursuant to law. Any notice given by Landlord to Tenant under this Article SIXTEENTH shall be deemed a “ten day notice to quit” under the provisions of Section 713 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall not have the right to terminate this Lease based upon the failure of Tenant to pay Rent unless Tenant shall have failed to pay Rent hereunder, after notice, as aforesaid, on more than two (2) occasions in any twelve (12) month period.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">16</p>
          <p id="s1p123">(B) In the event that this Lease shall end, Landlord and its agents and servants may immediately, or at any time after such default or after the date upon which this Lease and the Demised Term shall expire and come to an end, re-enter the Demised Premises or any part thereof, without notice, either by summary proceedings or by any other applicable action or proceeding, or by force or otherwise (without being liable to indictment, prosecution or damages therefor), and may repossess the Demised Premises and dispossess Tenant and any other persons from the Demised Premises and remove any and all of their property and effects from the Demised Premises including Tenant’s equipment and Landlord, at Landlord’s option, may release the whole or any part or parts of the Demised Premises, from time to time, either in the name of Landlord or otherwise, to such tenant or tenants, for such term or terms ending before, on or after the expiration date of the Demised Term, at such rental or rental fees or otherwise and upon such other conditions, which may include concessions and free rent periods, as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may determine. Tenant hereby waives the service of any notice of intention to re-enter or to institute legal proceedings to that end which may otherwise be required to be given under any present or future law. Tenant, on its own behalf and on behalf of all persons claiming through or under Tenant, including all creditors, does further hereby waive any and all rights which Tenant and all such persons might otherwise have under any present or future law to redeem the Demised Premises, or to re-enter or repossess the Demised Premises, or to restore the operation of this Lease, after (i) Tenant shall have been dispossessed by a judgment or by warrant of any court or judge, or (ii) any re-entry by Landlord, or (iii) any expiration or termination of this Lease and the Term, whether such dispossess, re-entry, expiration or termination shall be by operation of law or pursuant to the provisions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">SEVENTEENTH: Inability to Perform. If, by reason of strikes or other labor disputes, fire or other casualty (or reasonable delays in adjustment of insurance), accidents, Legal Requirement or any orders of any Government Authority, or any other cause beyond Landlord or Tenant’s reasonable control, whether or not such other cause shall be similar in nature to those hereinbefore enumerated, Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, is unable to perform, fulfill or is delayed in fulfilling any of their respective obligations under this Lease or any instrument collateral thereto, then the performance or observance of such obligation shall be suspended to the extent of and during the duration of such inability and (i) no such inability or delay shall constitute an actual or constructive eviction of Tenant, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of any of the Fixed Rent or any other sum due Landlord from Tenant hereunder, or (ii) no such inability or delay shall relieve Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, from any of their respective obligations under this Lease which are not affected by such inability or delay, or impose any liability upon Landlord, or Tenant as the case may be, or their agents, by reason of inconvenience or annoyance to the other party, or injury to or interruption of Tenant’s business, or otherwise. The provisions of this Article SEVENTEENTH shall not apply to the obligations of either Landlord or Tenant to pay any monies due the other party. Landlord and Tenant, as the case may be applicable, each agrees to employ reasonable diligence to eliminate the cause of any inability or delay referred to in this Article, however, the provisions of this sentence shall not apply in the event of any strike or labor dispute and neither party shall be required to employ labor at overtime or any other premium pay rates unless there is a danger or threatened danger to the health or safety of any occupant of the Building or the environmental condition thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">17</p>
          <p id="s1p126">EIGHTEENTH: Notices. Any bills, statements, notices, demands, requests or other communications given or required to be given pursuant to this Lease shall be effective only if rendered or given in writing, sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or overnight mail, addressed (a) to Tenant (i) at the address set forth above or (ii) at any place where Tenant or any agent of Tenant may be found if mailed subsequent to Tenant’s vacating, abandoning or surrendering the Demised Premises, with a copy to Michael D.

Any such bill, statement, notice, demand, request or other communication shall be deemed to have been rendered or given on the date when it shall have been mailed as provided herein. Either party shall have the right to change its address for notices hereunder provided it gives prior written notice of such change in accordance with this Article 18th.</p>

Tenant covenants and agrees that prior to and throughout the Term, it shall not take any action which would violate Landlord’s union contract of which Tenant has notice, if any, affecting the Building, nor create any work stoppage, picketing, labor disruption or dispute, or any interference with the business of the Landlord or any other tenant or occupant in the Building or with the rights and privileges of any person(s) lawfully in said Building, nor cause any impairment or reduction of the good name of the Building. Any default by Tenant under this Article shall be deemed a material default entitling Landlord to exercise any or all of the remedies provided for herein, at law and in equity</p>
          <p id="s1p136">(H) Wherever in this Lease it is provided that either party shall not unreasonably withhold consent or approval or shall exercise its judgment reasonably, and if no specific time period is given, such consent or approval or exercise of judgment shall also not be unreasonably delayed and if not given or denied within the time period specified, or if no time period is specified, within ten (10) days, approval shall be deemed denied.</p>

          <p id="s1p138">(J) If any provision of this Lease, or its application to any situation shall be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Lease, or the application thereof to situations other than that as to which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and every provision of this Lease shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
          <p id="s1p139">(K) In the event of a breach or threatened breach by either party of any of the covenants or provisions of this Lease, the other party shall have the right of injunction and the right to invoke any remedy allowed at law or in equity as if re-entry, summary proceedings and other remedies were not herein provided for. Mention in this Lease of any particular remedy shall not preclude either party from any other remedy, at law or in equity. Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant’s being evicted or dispossessed, or in the event of Landlord’s obtaining possession of the Demised Premises by reason of Tenant’s violation of the provisions of this Lease.

          <p id="s1p141">19</p>
          <p id="s1p142">(M) If the Tenant is a corporation (other than one whose shares are regularly and publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange), partnership or other entity other than an individual, Tenant represents that the authority and power to vote the majority of its entire outstanding capital stock or other controlling interest belongs to and is vested in the person(s) executing this Lease or members of his or their immediate family.</p>

Tenant agrees that the provisions of this Paragraph is intended to constitute “an express provision to the contrary” within the meaning of said Section 223-a.</p>
          <p id="s1p144">(O) If any of the rents payable under the terms of this Lease shall be or become uncollectible, reduced or required to be refunded because of any applicable law, ordinance, order, rule, requirement or regulation, Tenant shall enter into such agreement(s) and take such other steps (without additional expense to Tenant) as Landlord may request and as may be legally permissible to permit Landlord to collect the maximum rents which from time to time during the continuance of such legal rent restriction may be legally permissible (and not in excess of the amounts reserved therefor under this Lease). Upon the termination of such legal rent restriction, (a) the rents shall become and thereafter be payable in accordance with the amounts reserved herein for the periods following such termination and (b) Tenant shall pay to Landlord, to the maximum extent legally permissible, an amount equal to (i) the rents which would have been paid pursuant to this Lease but for such legal rent restriction less (ii) the rents paid by Tenant during the period such legal rent restriction was in effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">(P) Tenant represents that it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and authorized to maintain and conduct its business under the laws of the State of New York and that the party executing this Lease on its behalf is authorized to so execute this Lease and bind Tenant.</p>

Any subsequent changes to those listings which Tenant desires to make shall be subject to Landlord’s approval. If such desired changes are approved, Landlord shall implement such changes at Tenant’s cost, which Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, within ten (10) days after receipt of written demand therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">(S) LATE PAYMENT BY TENANT: If a default in payment of any such installment shall continue for a period of ten (10) days or more, more than twice in any given twelve (12) month period, then, and in such event, at the election of Landlord, and without further notice to or demand from the Tenant, the whole of the Rent and Additional Rent hereby reserved for the term then remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and payable. In addition, in the event Tenant fails to pay any installment of the Minimum Rent or Additional Rent when due an such default shall continue for ten (10) days, then in addition to any other remedy which Landlord shall be entitled to exercise under the law, in equity or under this Lease, Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent a late charge of five (5%) percent of the dollar amount in default or five-hundred ($500.00) per month, whichever is greater upon demand by Landlord. Furthermore, in the event Tenant issues a bad check, Landlord shall be entitled to collect as Additional Rent, a $200.00 service charge. In the event of any failure on the part of Tenant to pay any Additional Rent, Landlord shall have all the rights, powers, and remedies provided for in this Lease, at law, in equity or otherwise, in the case of nonpayment of Fixed or Minimum Rent. Nothing herein shall be construed to extend the due dates of Tenant’s payments under this Lease, or to waive any rights or remedies of Landlord in the event of Tenant’s late payment. Tenant’s obligation to pay Fixed Rent and Additional Rent shall survive the expiration of the Lease term or earlier termination thereof. Tenant further agrees and acknowledges that any late charge imposed hereunder is fair and reasonable and complies with all laws, regulations and statutes, and constitutes an agreement between Landlord and Tenant as to the estimated compensation for costs and administrative expenses incurred by Landlord due to the late payment of rent to Landlord by Tenant and that the same does not constitute a penalty of any kind.</p>
          <p id="s1p149">20</p>
          <p id="s1p150">TWENTIETH: Security. The sum of One HundredNinety Two Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty Seven and 50/100 Dollars ($192,937.50) representing security (referred to as “Security”) for the faithful performance and observance by Tenant of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease on Tenant’s part to be observed and performed is due and payable at the time of the execution and delivery of this Lease. In the event of any default by Tenant in the observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be observed or performed including, but not limited to, any default in the payment when due of any monthly installment of the Fixed Rent or increase in the Fixed Rent payable pursuant to the provisions of Articles TWENTY-FIRST or TWENTY-SECOND or of any additional rent, Landlord may use or apply all or any part of the Security for the payment to Landlord for Tenant’s account of any sum or sums due under this Lease, without thereby waiving any other rights or remedies of Landlord with respect to such default. Tenant agrees to replenish all or any part of the Security so used or applied during the Term. In the event that Tenant shall fully and faithfully comply with all of the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Lease, the Security shall be returned to Tenant after the date fixed as the end of the Lease and after delivery of entire possession of the Demised Premises to Owner. Tenant agrees that, unless required by law or by the general policies of lending institutions in New York City, Landlord shall not be required to deposit the Security in an interest-bearing savings account and shall deposit the same with a New York bank selected by Landlord.. Tenant agrees that Tenant shall not assign or encumber any part of the Security, and no assignment or encumbrance by Tenant of all or any part of the Security shall be binding upon Landlord, whether made prior to, during, or after the Term. Landlord shall not be required to exhaust its remedies against Tenant or against the Security before having recourse to any other form of security held by Landlord and recourse by Landlord to any form of security shall not affect any remedies of Landlord which are provided in this Lease or which are available to Landlord in law or equity. In the event of any sale, assignment or transfer by Landlord named herein (or by any subsequent Landlord) of its interest in the Building as owner or lessee, Landlord (or such subsequent owner) shall have the right to assign or transfer the Security to its grantee, assignee or transferee and, in the event of such assignment or transfer, Landlord named herein, (or such subsequent Landlord) shall have no liability to Tenant for the return of the Security and Tenant shall look solely to the grantee, assignee or transferee for such return. A lease of the entire Building shall be deemed a transfer within the meaning of the foregoing sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the foregoing provisions of this Article, Landlord shall be entitled to retain the one (1%) percent administrative fee permitted by law to be retained by landlords with respect to security deposits. Provided that Tenant is not then in default under this Lease after applicable notice and expiration of any applicable grace period, Landlord shall return (or credit) to Tenant on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Commencement Date, a portion of the Security held under the provisions of this Article 20th equal to Eighty Five Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty and 00/100 Dollars ($85,750.00), and as a result thereof the Security hereunder shall be then reduced to One Hundred Seven Thousand One Hundred Eighty Seven and 50/100 Dollars ($107,187.50); further provided, however, that in the event of two (2) defaults by Tenant under this Lease (and failure to cure beyond applicable notice and cure periods in each instance) which defaults occur subsequent to such reduction in the amount of Security, Landlord shall entitled to demand restoration of the amount of Security so reduced to the original amount of Security under this Lease as of the Commencement Date and Tenant shall so restore said amount within ten (10) day after written demand thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p151">TWENTY-FIRST: Tax Escalation.</p>
          <p id="s1p152">(A) Definitions: In the determination of any increase in the Fixed Rent under the provisions of this Article, Landlord and Tenant agree that the following terms shall have the following meanings:</p>
          <p id="s1p153">21</p>
          <p id="s1p154">(1) The term “Tax Escalation Year” shall mean each fiscal year commencing July 1st and ending on the following June 30th which shall include any part of the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p155">(2) The term “Taxes” shall mean the sum of the real estate taxes and assessments, water and sewer rents, Business Improvement District taxes, charges and assessments, and special assessments, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, of any kind or nature whatsoever, imposed, assessed and/or levied upon the Building and/or the plot of land on which the Building stands (the “Land”) and any rights or interests appurtenant thereto payable by Landlord during any Tax Year. If at any time during the Term the methods of taxation prevailing at the time of the commencement thereof shall be altered so that in lieu of or as an addition to or as a substitute for the whole or any part of the real estate taxes, assessments, levies, impositions or charges now levied, assessed or imposed, there shall be levied, assessed or imposed a tax, assessment, levy, imposition or charge wholly or partially as a capital levy or on the rents, licenses or other charges received with respect to the Demised Premises, the Land or the Building, then all such taxes, assessments, levies, impositions or charges payable shall be deemed to be included within the term “Taxes” for the purposes hereof. A copy of the tax bill of The City of New York or other taxing authority imposing Taxes on the Land or the Building shall be sufficient evidence of the amount of Taxes. Notwithstanding the fact that the aforesaid Additional Rent is measured by Taxes, such amount is Additional Rent and shall be paid by Tenant as provided herein regardless of the fact that Tenant may be exempt, in whole or in part, from the payment of any Taxes for any reason whatsoever.</p>
          <p id="s1p156">(3) The term “Tenant’s Proportionate Share” shall mean Eight and 00/100 (8.00%) Percent.</p>
          <p id="s1p157">(4) The term “Landlord’s Basic Tax Liability” shall mean a sum equal to Taxes, as finally determined, payable for the calendar year 2011 comprising of (i) the second half of the fiscal tax year of the City of New York commencing on July 1, 2010 and ending on June 30, 2011 and (ii) the first half of the fiscal tax year of the City of New York commencing on July 1, 2011 and ending on June 30, 2012.</p>
          <p id="s1p158">(B) If Taxes payable in any Tax Escalation Year shall be in such amount as shall constitute an increase above Landlord’s Basic Tax Liability, the Fixed Rent for such Tax Escalation Year shall be increased by a sum equal to Tenant’s Proportionate Share of any such increase. Tenant shall pay any such amounts owing to Landlord pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article within ten (10) days after the submission by Landlord to Tenant of a bill therefor, setting forth the sum owed by Tenant and the supporting calculation therefore. Tenant’s obligation to make such payments shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. All sums payable under this Article shall, unless otherwise elected by Landlord, be collectible by Landlord in the same manner as Fixed Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p159">(C) Only Landlord shall be eligible to institute tax reduction or other proceedings to reduce the assessed valuation of the real property. Tenant shall pay, as additional rent, Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the all reasonable expenses allocable to any tax reduction during the term of this Lease, within 30 days of the furnishing to Tenant of a statement of such expenses by Landlord, provided that Tenant’s Proportionate Share of such expenses does not exceed Tenant’s savings as a result of such tax reduction. If, after Tenant shall have paid Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Taxes with respect to any Tax Escalation Year, Landlord shall receive a refund of any portion of the Taxes by final determination of legal proceedings, settlement or otherwise, Landlord shall promptly after receiving such refund pay Tenant Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the refund, after deducting any and all reasonable expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with said refund including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, court, or other administrative costs and disbursements incurred by Landlord in connection with any such refund.</p>
          <p id="s1p160">TWENTY-SECOND: Intentionally Omitted.</p>
          <p id="s1p161">TWENTY-THIRD: Right to Cure Defaults.</p>
          <p id="s1p162">If Tenant shall fail to comply fully with any of its obligations under this Lease (including, without limitation, its obligations to make repairs, maintain public liability and other insurance and comply with all legal requirements), after applicable notice and the expiration of any applicable grace period, Landlord, without thereby waiving such default and without liability to Tenant, may, but shall not be obligated to, perform the same for the account and at the expense of Tenant without notice in case of emergency and upon five (5) days’ prior notice in all other cases. Landlord may enter the Demised Premises at any time to cure any default. Bills for expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with any such performance or involved in collecting or endeavoring to collect rent or enforcing or endeavoring to enforce any rights against Tenant under or in connection with this Lease or pursuant to law, including any costs, expense and disbursement involved in instituting and prosecuting summary proceedings, as well as bills for any property, material, labor or services provided, furnished or rendered, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, together with interest on the amount of such costs, expenses and disbursements at the highest rate permitted by law, shall be paid by Tenant as Additional Rent on demand.</p>
          <p id="s1p163">22</p>
          <p id="s1p164">TWENTY-FOURTH: Consents.</p>
          <p id="s1p165">Wherever in this Lease Landlord’s consent or approval is required and Landlord has agreed therein that such consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, if Landlord shall refuse such consent or approval (in such cases) Tenant in no event shall be entitled to and shall not make any claim, and Tenant hereby waives any claim, for money damages (nor shall Tenant claim any money damages by way of set-off, counterclaim or defense) based upon any assertion by Tenant that Landlord unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed its consent or approval. Tenant’s sole remedy in such circumstance shall be an action or proceeding to enforce any such provision by way of specific performance, injunction or declaratory judgment.</p>
          <p id="s1p166">TWENTY-FIFTH: Guaranty.</p>
          <p id="s1p167">Intentionally Omitted.</p>
          <p id="s1p168">TWENTY-SIXTH: Change of Location: Intentionally Omitted.</p>
          <p id="s1p169">TWENTY-SEVENTH: Certificate of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p170">Tenant shall, without charge, at any time and from time to time, within ten (10) days after request by Landlord, the lessor under any Superior Lease and/or the holder of a Superior Mortgage, as the case may be, execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord or any other person, firm or corporation specified by Landlord, a written instrument (an “Estoppel Certificate”) in the form as may be reasonably required by Landlord, the lessor under any such Superior Lease and/or the holder of any such Superior Mortgage.</p>
          <p id="s1p171">TWENTY-EIGHTH: Glass.</p>
          <p id="s1p172">Landlord shall replace, at the expense of Tenant, any and all plate and other glass damaged or broken from any cause whatsoever in and about the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p173">TWENTY-NINETH: Intentionally Omitted.</p>
          <p id="s1p174">THIRTIETH: Future Condominium Conversion</p>
          <p id="s1p175">Tenant acknowledges that the Building and the land of which the Premises form a part may be subjected to the condominium form of ownership prior to the end of the Term of this Lease, which condominiumization may be commercial or residential in nature, or a combination thereof. Tenant agrees that if, at any time during the Term, the Building and the land shall be subjected to the condominium form of ownership, then, this Lease and all rights of tenant hereunder are and shall be subject and subordinate in all respects to any condominium declaration and any other documents (collectively, the “Declaration”) which shall be recorded in order to convert the Building and the land of which the Premises form a part to a condominium form of ownership in accordance with the provisions of Article 9-B of the Real property Law of the State of New York or any successor thereto, provided that such declaration does not materially reduce Tenant’s rights, or materially increase Tenant’s obligations set forth in this Lease. If any such Declaration is to be recorded, Tenant, upon request of Landlord, shall enter into an amendment of this Lease in such respects as shall be necessary to conform to such condominiumization, including, without limitation, appropriate adjustments to Real Estate taxes payable during the Landlord’s Basic Tax Liability and Tenant’s Proportionate Share, as such terms are defined in Article 21 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p176">23</p>
          <p id="s1p177">THIRY-FIRST: Shoring</p>
          <p id="s1p178">Tenant shall permit any person authorized to make an excavation on land adjacent to the Building containing the Premises to do any work within the Premises necessary to preserve the wall of the Building from injury or damage, at such authorized person’s cost, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for damages, eviction or abatement or rent by reason thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p179">THIRTY-SECOND: Eminent Domain</p>
          <p id="s1p180">(A)</p>
          <p id="s1p181">Total Condemnation: If the whole of the Premises shall be acquired or condemned by reason of eminent domain for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, or access thereto shall be materially affected, then, the Term shall cease and terminate as of the dated of title vesting in such proceeding and all rentals shall be paid up to that date and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for the value of any unexpired Term, but have such claim against condemning authority.</p>
          <p id="s1p182">(B) Partial Condemnation: If any part of the Premises shall be acquired or condemned by reason of eminent domain for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, and in the event that such partial taking or condemnation renders the Premises unusable in the reasonable judgment of Tenant for the business of Tenant, then the Term shall cease and terminate as of the date of title vesting in such proceeding and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for the value of any unexpired Term, but may make such claim against condemning authority. In the event of a partial taking or condemnation which is not extensive enough to render the Premises unusable for the business of Tenant, then Landlord shall promptly restore the Premises to a condition comparable to its condition at the time of such condemnation less the portion lost in the taking, and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p183">(C) Landlord's Damage: In the event of any condemnation or taking as here before provided, whether whole or partial, Tenant shall not be entitled to any part of the award, except as specifically provided below and Landlord is to receive the full amount of such award.</p>
          <p id="s1p184">(D) Tenant's Damages: Tenant shall have the right to claim and recover from the condemning authority but not from Landlord, such compensation as may be separately awarded or recoverable by Tenant in account of any and all damage to Tenant's business by reasons of the condemnation and for or on account of any cost or loss to which Tenant might be put in removing Tenant's merchandise, furniture, fixtures, leasehold improvements and equipment. Rent shall be abated to reflect Tenant’s use of actual area of the Premises during any period of partial taking or condemnation.</p>

No tenant shall invite to the tenant’s premises, or permit the visit of, persons in such numbers or under such conditions as to interfere with the use and enjoyment of any of the entrances, corridors, elevators and other facilities of the Building by other tenants. Fire exits and stairways are for emergency use only, and they shall not be used for any other purposes by the tenants, their employees, licensees or invitees. No tenant shall encumber or obstruct, or permit the encumbrance or obstruction of any of the sidewalks, entrances, corridors, elevators, fire exits or stairways of the Building. The Landlord reserves the right to control and operate the public portions of the Building and the public facilities, as well as facilities furnished for the common use of the tenants, in such manner as it reasonably deems best for the benefit of the tenants generally.</p>
          <p id="s1p283">(b) The cost of repairing any damage to the public portions of the Building or the public facilities or to any facilities used in common with other tenants, caused by a tenant or the employees, licensees or invitees of the tenant, shall be paid by such Tenant.</p>

Tenant’s employees, agents and visitors shall be permitted to enter and leave the building whenever appropriate arrangements have been previously made between the Landlord and the Tenant with respect thereto.

Any person whose presence in the Building at any time shall, in the reasonable judgment of the Landlord, be prejudicial to the safety, character, reputation and interests of the Building or its tenants may be denied access to the Building or may be ejected therefrom. In case of invasion, riot, public excitement or other commotion, the Landlord may prevent all access to the Building during the continuance of the same, by closing the doors or otherwise, for the safety of the tenants and protection of property in the Building. The Landlord may require any person leaving the Building with any package or other object to exhibit a pass from the tenant from whose premises the package or object is being removed, but the establishment and enforcement of such requirements shall not impose any responsibility on the Landlord for the protection of any tenant against the removal of property from the premises of the tenant.
