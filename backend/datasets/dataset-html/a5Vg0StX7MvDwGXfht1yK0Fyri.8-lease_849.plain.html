          <p id="s1p75">ARTICLE 1</p>
          <p id="s1p76">DEFINITIONS</p>
          <p id="s1p77">As used in this Lease, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed thereto:</p>
          <p id="s1p78">1.1 Btu: one British Thermal Unit..</p>

For purposes of this calculation, the OCD-2 Rate in effect as of the date of the adjustment shall be the OCD-2 Rate in effect on such date without regard to any retroactive adjustments</p>
          <p id="s1p82">3</p>
          <p id="s1p83">1.5 Gross Heating Value: the number of Btu’s contained in one cubic foot of Occluded Gas saturated with water vapor and adjusted on a dry basis to 14.73 psia.</p>
          <p id="s1p84">1.6 Initial Unit Investment: with respect to each Payout Unit, all reasonable costs incurred by Lessee in order to bring into production the wells included in the relevant Payout Unit, including (a) title work, drillsite location and preparation, (b) the drilling, testing, coring, coal analysis, logging, hydraulic fracturing, and equipping each well for production; and (c) a fair and reasonable allocation (not to exceed 90%) of the cost of building access roads. Other common utilities such as power lines will be allocated based on planned useage requirements. Costs chargeable to the Initial Unit Investment shall cease to accrue for each well within a Payout Unit as of the time the well commences production. In the case of a well judged not economical and abandoned before being brought into production, the cost of plugging will also be included in the Initial Unit Investment. All costs of the gathering, compression, treatment, and distribution systems are specifically excluded from the Initial Unit Investment.</p>

          <p id="s1p140">ROYALTIES</p>
          <p id="s1p141">4.1 Lessee covenants and agrees to pay to Lessor a royalty on all Occluded Gas produced from each Payout Unit on the Leased Premises as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p142">(a)</p>
          <p id="s1p143">Prior to Payout:</p>
          <p id="s1p144">one-tenth (1/10) of the Average Wellhead Price;</p>
          <p id="s1p145">(b)</p>

          <p id="s1p147">(i)</p>
          <p id="s1p148">Lessor shall have the option of continuing to receive the royalty provided in Article 4.1(a) above or four-tenths (4/10) of the Net Profits.</p>

          <p id="s1p150">Lessor shall evidence its election whether to exercise such option as to each Payout Unit by written notice to Lessee during the thirty-day period immediately following receipt from Lessor of a notice of Payout. The failure of Lessor to provide Lessee with written notice of its election during the thirty-day period shall constitute an election by Lessor to retain its one-tenth (1/10) royalty interest in the relevant Payout Unit. If Lessor elects to convert its royalty for any Payout Unit to four-tenths (4/10) of the Net Profits, the royalty provided in Article 4.1(a) above shall cease and terminate, as to such Payout Unit and such conversion shall become effective, as of the first day of the month following the month in which Payout occurred.</p>
          <p id="s1p151">9</p>
          <p id="s1p152">(iii)</p>
          <p id="s1p153">If the calculation of Net Profits results in a negative number (“Net Losses”) during any royalty period for any Payout Unit as to which Lessor has elected a royalty of four-tenths (4/10) of Net Profits, royalty for said Payout Unit shall be zero for said royalty period. Net Losses shall not be netted with royalties or Net Profits from other Payout Units and Lessor shall not be required to share said Net Losses in any way except that Lessor may accumulate said Net Losses with Net Profits from the same Payout Unit for subsequent royalty periods for the purpose of calculating royalties payable with respect to said subsequent royalty periods.</p>

If expansion of the drilling unit is required or permitted under any governmental rule or order for operations in connection with the production of Occluded Gas, or for obtaining the maximum allowable, any such drilling unit may, on Lessor’s prior written consent, be reformed to conform to the size so required or permitted. Lessee shall exercise the privilege to pool or combine land as to each drilling unit by executing the appropriate permit application forms and sending copies of same to Lessor with a request that the drilling so designed be approved within 15 days of receipt and, thereafter, Lessee shall file said application with the appropriate regulatory authority. Lessee, with Lessor’s prior written consent, may unitize one or more drilling units in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 9-17-80 et seq., Code of Alabama (1975), pertaining to Unit Operations. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, after the expiration of the Primary Term hereof, operations on or production from a drilling unit or a unitized area or areas established under this Article 11 shall maintain this Lease in force only as to the land included in such drilling unit or unitized area or areas. Upon the pooling and/or unitization of less than all of the Leased Premises, this Lease shall be severed and considered as separate and distinct Leases. The Lease term and all the rights and obligations of the Lessee under this instrument shall apply separately to the pooled and unpooled acreage.

          <p id="s1p294">(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Lease, Lessee assumes all risk of bodily injury, death, and property damage from any cause whatsoever.

Furthermore, Lessee shall have automobile liability insurance including owned, non-owned and hired vehicle coverage with limits of liability not less than $500,000 combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage claims. In addition, Lessee shall maintain excess (umbrella) liability insurance over the comprehensive general liability and automobile liability insurance coverage afforded by the primary policies described above, with minimum limits of $5,000,000 excess of the specific limits. If Lessee self-insures comprehensive general liability and/or automobile liability through the use of deductibles or self-insured retentions and does not maintain primary liability policies, Lessee shall maintain $5,000,000 of umbrella liability coverage in excess of its self-insured retentions for comprehensive general and automobile liability. Lessee shall furnish Lessor with an appropriate certificate of insurance within thirty (30) days of the execution hereof. The requirement for insurance hereunder does not in any way release Lessee of its indemnification obligations under this Lease and does not diminish or limit said obligations.</p>

          <p id="s1p388">NOW THEREFORE, Lessor and Lessee, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:</p>

          <p id="s1p390">1.4 Development Commitment Price: With respect to any year, the amount of the Wellhead Price that would have been in effect on September 1 of the preceding year if it had been calculated pursuant to Article 1.22(a), substituting “September 1” for “January 1” in said Article each time it appears. For purposes of this calculation, the OCD-2 Rate in effect as of said September 1 shall be the OCD-2 Rate in effect on such date without regard to any retroactive adjustments.</p>

          <p id="s1p392">2. Section 1.22(a)(i)[l1 of the Occluded Gas Lease shall be amended to read in its-entirety as follows:</p>

Lessor and Lessee agree that $2.45 shall constitute a floor only for purposes of determining Lessee’s royalty obligation to Lessor through December 31, 1990, and shall not constitute a minimum floor for purposes of establishing Lessee’s Development Commitment Price.</p>

          <p id="s1p397">For each month during the term of this Lease beginning January 1987, the Wellhead Price shall be determined under this Section 1.22(a) using the OCD-2 Rate in effect for the first day of said month and shall be adjusted retroactively when necessary to reflect any retroactive changes to the OCD-2 Rate. The Treatment Factor used in said calculations shall likewise be the Treatment Factor determined as of the first day of said month, as set forth in Section 1.20.</p>
          <p id="s1p398">29</p>
          <p id="s1p399">4. Section 5.1(e) of the Occluded Gas Lease shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows:</p>

Such arms-length price shall be calculated by taking the average of the three (3) highest prices paid for gas under similar contract and delivery conditions within a 25-mile radius of the lands covered by the Lease. If no such sales on sin liar contract and delivery conditions can be identified, the arms-length price shall instead be calculated by taking the average of the three (3) highest prices paid for Occluded Gas produced within a 25-mile radius of the lands covered by this Lease, which shall then be adjusted for the reasonable value of differences in the contract and/or delivery conditions.</p>
