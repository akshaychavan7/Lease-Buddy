Such costs and expenses will include, without limitation, loss of use of money, administrative and collection costs, and processing and accounting expenses. Therefore, if any Installment of Minimum Annual Rent is not received by Landlord from Tenant by the fifth (5th) business day of the month for which such installment is due, Tenant shall immediately pay to Landlord a late charge equal to 10% of such installment. Such late charge is in addition to any interest due pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section 9.6. Landlord and Tenant agree that this late charge represents a reasonable estimate of costs and expenses incurred by Landlord from, and is fair compensation to Landlord for its loss suffered by, such nonpayment by Tenant. Acceptance of this late charge shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default with respect to such nonpayment by Tenant nor prevent Landlord from exercising any other rights and remedies available to Landlord under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">9.7 Payment of Rent. All Rent and other payments due under this Lease shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord at Landlord’s management office in the Shopping Center, or at such other place as may from time to time be designated by Landlord in writing at least 10 days prior to the next ensuing payment date.</p>

No aerials or antennae shall be erected on the roof or exterior walls of the Premises or Building without first obtaining, in each instance, the written consent of Landlord. Any aerial or antenna so installed without Landlord’s written consent may be removed without notice at any time, at Tenant’s expense. Tenant shall not solicit or distribute materials in any manner in any of the Common Areas (including automobile parking facilities and any enclosed mall of the Shopping Center).</p>
          <p id="s1p198">11.2 Insurance Coverage Use Restrictions. Tenant shall not carry any stock or goods or do anything in or about the Premises which tends to increase the insurance rates on the Building or Shopping Center or impairs Landlord’s ability to maintain insurance coverage on the Building or Shopping Center. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord promptly upon demand the amount of any increases in Landlord’s insurance premiums caused by Tenant’s violation of these restrictions, whether or not Landlord has consented to such act(s) by Tenant. If Tenant installs any electrical equipment in the Premises which overloads the electrical lines of the Premises, Tenant shall, at its expense, make any changes and install any fire extinguishing equipment required by Landlord’s insurance underwriters or applicable fire, safety and building codes and regulations. Nothing herein contained constitutes Landlord’s consent to such overloading.</p>

          <p id="s1p201">12.1 Utilities Installation. Landlord agrees that to the extent provided for in Exhibit “C” hereof, it will initially make available to Tenant (i) facilities for the removal of sewage and the delivery to and distribution within the Premises of water, electricity, telephone service and natural gas (which shall be used by Tenant for cooking and demonstration of gas operated sales items only) [these facilities are collectively referred to in this Article 12 as “utilities”], and (ii) a heating, ventilation and air conditioning</p>
          <p id="s1p202">5</p>
          <p id="s1p203">system (the “HVAC system”). Unless Landlord agrees otherwise, Tenant shall use only those utilities and any HVAC system provided for under Exhibit “C” to Serve the Premises. If required under Exhibit “C” a separate meter shall measure the consumption of utilities and/or the HVAC system.</p>
          <p id="s1p204">If not required to be furnished by Landlord under Exhibit “C”, Tenant shall be responsible for obtaining any utilities and/or HVAC system required for Tenant’s business operations in the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p205">12.2 Utilities and HVAC System Charges. Tenant shall pay for all utilities used by Tenant on the Premises from and after substantial completion of Landlord’s Work in the Premises. If Tenant’s utilities and/or HVAC system are separately metered, Tenant shall pay directly to the appropriate utility company the cost of all such utilities used on the Premises. If any of Tenant’s utilities and/or HVAC system are furnished by Landlord without separate metering, then during the Term Tenant shall pay as additional rent, monthly in advance, a utilities charge to reimburse Landlord for any such utilities furnished by Landlord to the Premises. This utilities charge shall, at Landlord’s election, be established (a) by an estimate of usage made from time to time by Landlord’s engineer or the appropriate utility company, and initially based on a typical store layout comparable to Tenant’s proposed use of the Premises, or (b) a percentage of such total utility costs equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the Floor Area of the Premises, and the denominator of which is the Floor Area of Shopping Center actually being furnished with utility service by Landlord at the time of billing. If Tenant’s Premises is not separately metered, such utilities and/or HVAC charges may be billed with Tenant’s share of Common Area Costs under Section 25.3. The utilities charge to Tenant hereunder for utilities furnished by Landlord shall be based on utility rates which do not exceed those charged by the local public utility company for services it would otherwise furnish directly to Tenant. If the Premises are not initially separately metered, Landlord shall have the right, at its expense, to install separate meters for the Premises at any time during the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">12.3 Failure to Pay.

          <p id="s1p207">12.4 No Landlord Liability. Landlord shall not be liable in damages or otherwise for any failure or interruption of (i) any utility service being furnished to the Premises, or (ii) operation of the HVAC system, if any. No such failure or interruption shall entitle Tenant to terminate this Lease or stop making any Rent or other payments due hereunder.</p>

          <p id="s1p209">Tenant shall indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from any and all costs, claims or liability of any kind arising out of: (a) Tenant’s use and occupancy of the Premises, (b) the conduct of Tenant’s business or any work, activity or other things allowed or permitted by Tenant to be done in or on the Premises; (c) any breach or default in the performance of any of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease; (d) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty by Tenant under this Lease; and/or (e) any other acts or omissions of Tenant, its agents, employees, invitees or contractors.

          <p id="s1p212">(i) LIABILITY INSURANCE. Commercial general liability insurance (sometimes known as comprehensive general liability insurance) insuring Tenant against liability for bodily injury, property damage (including loss of use of property) and personal injury arising out of the operation, use or occupancy of the Premises. Such policy shall be an occurrence form and shall include Owner’s and Contractor’s Protective Liability with respect to construction of improvements by Tenant on the Premises.

The liability insurance obtained by Tenant under this Section 14.1 (i) shall (1) be primary and non-contributing; (2) contain cross-liability endorsements; and (3) Insure Landlord against Tenant’s performance under Article 13(a), (b) and (e) if the matters giving rise to the indemnity under Article 13 result from the negligence of Tenant. The amount and coverage of such insurance shall not limit Tenant’s liability nor relieve Tenant of any other obligation under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p213">(ii) PLATE GLASS. Insurance covering the full replacement cost of all plate glass on the Premises. Tenant shall have the option to self-insure this risk.</p>

          <p id="s1p216">(a) Any insurance required to be maintained by Tenant hereunder shall include a provision which requires the insurance carrier to give Landlord not less than thirty (30) days’ written notice prior to any cancellation or modification of such coverage.</p>
          <p id="s1p217">(b) A certificate of the insurer or the insurer’s legal representative evidencing the existence and amount of each insurance policy required of Tenant hereunder shall be delivered to Landlord before the date Tenant is first given the right of possession of the Premises, and thereafter at least 30 days prior to the expiration of any such policy.

          <p id="s1p219">evidence of insurance to Landlord required under this Lease within the prescribed time period or if any such policy is cancelled or modified during the Lease Term without Landlord’s consent, Landlord may obtain such insurance coverage, in which case Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of such insurance within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a statement therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p220">(c) All insurance shall be maintained with companies holding a “General Policy Rating” of A-XII or better, as set forth in the most current issue of “Best’s Key Rating Guide.” Landlord and Tenant acknowledge the insurance markets are rapidly changing and that insurance in the form and amounts described in this Section 14.1 may not be available in the future. Tenant acknowledges that the insurance described in this Section 14.1 is for the primary benefit of Landlord. If at any time during the Lease Term, Tenant is unable to maintain the insurance required under the Lease, Tenant shall nevertheless maintain insurance coverage which is customary and commercially reasonable in the insurance industry for Tenant’s type of business, as that coverage may change from time to time. Landlord makes no representation as to the adequacy of such insurance to protect Landlord’s or Tenant’s interests. Therefore, Tenant shall be responsible for obtaining any such additional property or liability insurance which Tenant deems necessary to protect Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p221">14.2 Landlord’s Insurance Obligations. Landlord shall, in connection with its ownership and operation of the Shopping Center, at all times from and after commencement of Landlord’s Work in the Premises, maintain in effect policies of insurance providing protection against the following liabilities and/or risks: (a) commercial general liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000.00 combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage, and (b) fire and extended coverage insurance (including coverage for Common Area sprinkler damage, vandalism and malicious mischief, and, if required by any lender holding a security interest in the Shopping Center or if deemed necessary by Landlord, flood and earthquake insurance) on the Building and Shopping Center in an amount not less than their full replacement cost (exclusive of the cost of excavations, foundations and footings) from time to time during the Term. The types and coverages of insurance maintained by Landlord hereunder shall be subject to such further requirements as may be imposed by Landlord’s lender. Landlord shall also have the right to maintain such additional types and coverages of insurance (including business interruption insurance) as are customary, prudent or reasonable for shopping centers similar to the Shopping Center. Landlord’s obligation to carry the insurance provided for herein may be satisfied by blanket policies if the coverage required hereunder is satisfied.</p>

The foregoing waivers of subrogation shall be required hereunder only if (a) then available in the State where the Shopping Center is located, and (b) such waiver does not invalidate the applicable policy.</p>
          <p id="s1p223">15. TITLE OF LANDLORD.</p>
          <p id="s1p224">Landlord’s estate in the Shopping Center and Tenant’s leasehold estate in the Premises is subject to the liens or restrictions of (a) any matters or documents of record (the “Matters of Record”), including the effect of any covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, mortgages or deeds of trust, ground leases, rights of way or any construction, operation and reciprocal easement agreement (the “REA”); and (b) the effect of any zoning laws of the City, County and State where the Shopping Center is located.

If the REA, if any, is not of record as of the date of this Lease, then this Lease shall automatically become subordinate to the REA upon recordation of the REA. Tenant agrees to execute and return to Landlord within 10 days after written demand therefor by Landlord, an agreement in recordable form satisfactory to Landlord subordinating this Lease to the REA.

Landlord and Tenant further acknowledge that the character and quality of Tenant’s operation, and of the Shopping Center, will be enhanced by Tenant’s use of its best efforts, for a reasonable period of time, to establish a successful business and business image. Landlord and Tenant further agree that one year is a reasonable period of time to attempt to achieve this goal. Accordingly, Tenant agrees that for a period of one year from the date Tenant initially opens to the public for business in the Premises (the “Occupancy Period”), Tenant shall not, and shall not have the power to, transfer or assign this Lease, sublet the Premises, enter into license or concession agreements, or change ownership (such transactions are hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as a “Transfer”), without first procuring the written consent of Landlord, which may be given or withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion.

The Transfer Notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposed agreement documenting the Transfer, or if none, a copy of any offers, draft agreements, letters of commitment or intent and other documents pertaining to the proposed Transfer. In addition, the Transfer Notice shall be accompanied by the proposed Transferee’s income statements and balance sheets covering the preceding 36-month period, and each shall be certified as accurate by the Transferee. Landlord may, at any time within 30 days after its receipt of Transfer Notice, grant or withhold consent to such proposed Transfer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld under the business judgment standards set forth in Section 20.3 below) by mailing written notice to Tenant of its decision (“Decision Notice”). If Landlord consents to the proposed Transfer Tenant may thereafter promptly effect a Transfer in accordance with the terms of Tenant’s Transfer Notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p249">If Landlord consents to the proposed Transfer and Tenant does not consummate the proposed Transfer within 30 days after receipt of Decision Notice, the provisions of the first paragraph of this Section 20.2 shall again apply.</p>

Landlord may withhold consent to a proposed Transfer if, in Landlord’s reasonable business judgment, any of the following is the case: (i) the proposed Transfer may result in deterioration in the quality of merchandising operation conducted in the Premises, as compared to the merchandising operation conducted by Tenant prior to the date of Transfer Notice; (ii) the proposed Transferee lacks a good business reputation or sufficient relevant business experience; (iii) the financial worth of the proposed Transferee as of the date of Transfer Notice is less than the combined financial worth of Tenant and Tenant’s guarantor (if any) as of either the date of this Lease or the date of Transfer Notice; (iv) the proposed Transferee’s proposed use of the Premises conflicts with Tenant’s Use Clause or is otherwise incompatible with the tenant mix of the Shopping Center; (v) the annual percentage rent Landlord reasonably anticipates receiving from the proposed Transferee is significantly less than the annual percentage rent Landlord could reasonably anticipate receiving from Tenant; or (vi) the proposed Transfer would breach any covenant of Landlord respecting radius restrictions, use or exclusivity rights in any other lease, or any financing or other agreement relating to the Shopping Center. Any attempted or purported Transfer without Landlord’s written consent shall be void and of no force or effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p251">20.4 No Release from Liability. No Transfer, whether with or without Landlord’s consent, shall relieve Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, from its covenants and obligations hereunder during the Term. Tenant shall, promptly upon demand, reimburse Landlord for Landlord’s reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in conjunction with the processing and documentation of any requested Transfer. Landlord’s cost for consent shall not exceed $750.00.</p>
          <p id="s1p252">20.5 Transferee’s Obligations. Each Transfer to which Landlord has consented shall be evidenced by a written instrument in form satisfactory to Landlord, and executed by Tenant and the Transferee.

One fully executed copy of such written instrument shall be delivered to Landlord. Failure to obtain in writing Landlord’s prior consent or otherwise comply with the provisions of this Article 20 shall prevent any Transfer from becoming effective.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">20.6 Division of Profit Between Landlord and Tenant. Any sums or other economic consideration received by Tenant as a result of a Transfer, however denominated, which exceed, in the aggregate, (i) the total sums which Tenant is obligated to pay Landlord under this Lease (prorated to reflect obligations allocable to any portion of the Premises subleased), plus (ii) the unamortized value of leasehold improvements to the Premises paid for by Tenant prior to the date of Transfer Notice, depreciated on a straight-line basis over the Term, plus (iii) any real estate brokerage commissions or fees payable by Tenant in connection with such Transfer, plus (iv) costs of renovation or construction of improvements to the Premises for the benefit of the Transferee required to be paid for by Tenant as a part of the Transfer, shall be divided equally between Landlord and Tenant. Landlord’s share of such profit shall be paid to Landlord promptly following its receipt, as additional rent under this Lease. Such payments shall not affect or reduce any other obligations of Tenant hereunder. Landlord shall have the right to audit Tenant’s books and records during normal business hours at either the Premises or Tenant’s principal place of business upon 48 hours’ advance written notice for the purpose of verifying Tenant’s compliance with its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no profit shall be due Landlord for a sublease of 200sf or less.</p>
          <p id="s1p254">20.7 Further Restrictions. Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of Landlord (which consent may be granted or withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion), mortage or hypothecate this Lease or any interest herein. Tenant shall not permit the Premises to be used by any party other than Tenant or a permitted Transferee. Any of the foregoing acts without such consent shall be void and shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate this Lease. For purposes of this Article 20, if Tenant is a partnership, any withdrawal(s) or change(s) of partners cumulatively owning a 50% or more interest in the partnership, or if Tenant is a corporation, any transfer(s) cumulating 50% or more of its stock, shall constitute a voluntary Transfer and shall be subject to the provisions hereof. This Lease shall not, nor shall any interest of Tenant herein, be assignable by operation of law without the written consent of Landlord.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right (but shall not be required to) make such repairs so necessitated by Tenant. If Landlord elects to make such repairs on Tenant’s behalf, Tenant shall pay to Landlord any such costs incurred by Landlord promptly following receipt of a bill therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p266">It is understood and agreed that Landlord is under no obligation to make any repairs, alterations, replacements or improvements to the Premises or the mechanical equipment exclusively serving the Premises at any time except as expressly set forth in this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p268">22.3 Tenant’s Failure to Maintain Premises.

Nothing herein implies any duty of Landlord to do any such work which, under any provision of this Lease, Tenant is required to do, nor shall Landlord’s performance of any repairs on behalf of Tenant constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default in failing to do such work. No exercise by Landlord of any rights hereunder shall entitle Tenant to any compensation, damages or abatement of Rent for any injury or inconvenience occasioned by such exercise. If Landlord makes or performs any repairs provided for in (i) or (ii) above, Tenant shall pay the cost thereof to Landlord as additional rent promptly upon receipt of a bill therefor. SEE ADDENDUM.</p>

Such abatement shall commence on the date of destruction and continue during any period of reconstruction and replacement provided for in Section 23.3. Tenant shall continue to operate its business on the Premises during any such abatement period to the extent practical as a matter of prudent business management, and the obligation of Tenant to pay percentage rental and additional rent hereunder shall remain in full force and effect.

          <p id="s1p458">Property: 3500 College Blvd., Oceanside, CA</p>
          <p id="s1p459">. According to Flood ZonesFederal Emergency Management Agency. (Fidelity National Flood Map No. Map #6073C-766F dated 6/19/97)[specify source], the Property o is / x may or may not be located in an A or V flood zone and/or a dam inundation zone (Government Code Section 8589.5). Many lenders require flood insurance for properties located in flood zones, and government authorities may regulate development and construction in flood zones. Whether or not located in a flood zone, properties can be subject to flooding and moisture problems, especially properties on a slope or in low-lying areas. Buyers and tenants should have their experts confirm whether the Property is in a flood zone and otherwise investigate and evaluate these matters. Flood Zone Designation: Zone X</p>
          <p id="s1p460">. Earthquakes occur throughout California. According to EarthquakesAlquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act Fault-Rupture Hazard Zones in Calfornia (Publication 42, revised 1994)[specify source], the Property o is / x may or may not be situated in an Earthquake Fault Zone and/or a Seismic Hazard Zone (Sections 2621 et seq. and Sections 2690 et seq. of the Public Resources Code, respectively). Property development and construction in such zones generally are subject to the findings of a geologic report prepared by a state-registered geologist. Whether or not located in such a zone, all properties in California are subject to earthquake risks and may be subject to a variety of state and local earthquake-related requirements, including retrofit requirements. Among other items, all new and existing water heaters must be braced, anchored or strapped to resist falling or horizontal displacement, and in sales transactions, sellers must execute a written certification that the water heaters are so braced, anchored or strapped (Health and Safety Code Section 19211). If this is the sale of an unreinforced masonry building or a precast or reinforced masonry building with wood frame floors or roofs built before 1975, the buyer must be given a copy of The Commercial Property Owner’s Guide to Earthquake Safety (Government Code Sections 8875.6 and 8893.2). Buyers and tenants should have their experts confirm whether the Property is in any earthquake zone and otherwise investigate and evaluate these matters.</p>

Due to prior or current uses of the Property or in the area or the construction materials used, the Property may have hazardous or undesirable metals (including lead-based paint), minerals (including asbestos), chemicals, hydrocarbons, petroleum-related compounds, or biological or radioactive/emissive items (including electrical and magnetic fields) in soils, water, building components, above or below-ground tanks/containers or elsewhere in areas that may or may not be accessible or noticeable. Such Items may leak or otherwise be released. Asbestos has been used in items such as fireproofing, heating/cooling systems, insulation, spray-on and tile acoustical materials, floor tiles and coverings, roofing, drywall and plaster. If the Property was built before 1978 and has a residential unit, sellers/landlords must disclose all reports, surveys and other information known to them regarding lead-based paint to buyers and tenants and allow for inspections (42 United States Code Sections 4851 et seq.). Sellers/landlords are required to advise buyers/tenants if they have any reasonable cause to believe that any hazardous substance has come to be located on or beneath the Property (Health and Safety Code Section 25359.7), and sellers/landlords must disclose reports and surveys regarding asbestos to certain persons, including their employees, contractors, buyers and tenants (Health and Safety Code Sections 25915 et seq.); buyers/tenants have similar obligations.

          <p id="s1p463">. Sales, leases and other real estate transactions can have federal, state and local tax consequences. In sales transactions, Internal Revenue Code Section 1446 requires buyers to withhold and pay to the IRS 10% of the gross sales price within 10 days of the date of a sale unless the buyers can establish that the sellers are not foreigners, generally by having the sellers sign a Non-Foreign Seller Affidavit. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the tax withholding liability can exceed the net cash proceeds to be paid to the sellers at closing. California imposes an additional withholding requirement equal to 3 1/3% of the gross sales price not only on foreign sellers but also out-of-state sellers and sellers leaving the state if the sales price exceeds $100,000. Withholding generally is required if the last known address of a seller is outside California, if the proceeds are disbursed outside of California or if a financial intermediary is used. Have your experts investigate and evaluate these mattes.Taxes</p>
          <p id="s1p464">. California Public Resources Codes Sections 4125 et seq. require sellers of real property located within state responsibility areas to advise buyers that the property is located within such a wildland zone, that the state does not have the responsibility to provide fire protection services to any structure within such a zone and that such zones may contain substantial forest/wildland fire risks. Government Code Sections 51178 et seq. require sellers of real property located within certain fire hazard zones to disclose that the property is located in such a zone. Sellers must disclose that a property located in a wildland or fire hazard zone is subject to the fire prevention requirements of Public Resources Code Section 4291 and Government Code Section 51182, respectively. Sellers must make such disclosures if either the sellers have actual knowledge that a property is in such a zone or a map showing the property to be in such a zone has been provided to the county assessor.
