Any attempted subletting or assignment without Landlord's prior written consent, at Landlord's election, shall constitute a default by Tenant under the terms of this Lease. The acceptance of rent by Landlord from any person or entity other than Tenant, or the acceptance of rent by Landlord from Tenant with knowledge of a violation of the provisions of this paragraph, shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Article or this Lease or to be a consent to any subletting by Tenant or any assignment of Tenant's interest in this Lease. If Tenant assigns this Lease (whether or not Landlord's consent is required pursuant to the terms of this Article 7), Tenant shall simultaneously assign the El Capitan Lease to the same assignee.</p>

The phrase &quot;controlling percentage&quot; means the ownership of and the right to vote stock possessing more than fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Tenant's capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of directors. If Tenant is a</p>

Except as provided in Paragraph 7.2(b), no subletting or assignment, even with the consent of Landlord, shall relieve Tenant of its personal and primary obligation to pay rent and to perform all of the other obligations to be performed by Tenant hereunder. Consent by Landlord to one or more assignments of Tenant's interest in this Lease or to one or more sublettings of the Leased Premises shall not be deemed to be a consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting. No subtenant shall have any right to assign its sublease or to further sublet any portion of the sublet premises or to permit any portion of the sublet premises to be used or occupied by any other party. If Landlord shall have been ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to consent to a requested assignment or subletting, or such an assignment or subletting shall have been ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction over the objection of Landlord, such assignment or subletting shall not be binding between the assignee (or sublessee) and Landlord until such time as all conditions set forth in Paragraph 7.4 above have been fully satisfied (to the extent not then satisfied) by the assignee or sublessee, including, without limitation, the payment to Landlord of all agreed assignment considerations and/or excess rentals then due Landlord.</p>

          <p id="s1p516">(b) Tenant shall have done or permitted to be done any act, use or thing in its use, occupancy or possession of the Leased Premises or the Building or the Common Areas or the Property which is prohibited by the terms of this Lease or Tenant shall have failed to perform any term, covenant, or condition of this Lease (except those requiring the payment of Expense Rent or Additional Rent, which failures shall be governed by subparagraph (a) above) and such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice from Landlord to Tenant specifying the nature of such default and requesting Tenant to cure the same; or within such longer period as is reasonably required in the event such default is curable but not within such thirty (30) day period, provided such cure is promptly commenced within such thirty (30) day period and is thereafter diligently prosecuted to completion, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after such written notice from Landlord; or</p>
          <p id="s1p517">(c) Tenant shall have sublet the Leased Premises or assigned or encumbered its interest in this Lease in violation of the provisions contained in Article 7, whether voluntarily or by operation of law; or</p>

In the event of any default by Tenant, and without limiting Landlord's right to indemnification as provided in Article 8.2, Landlord shall have the following remedies, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law or otherwise provided in this Lease, to which Landlord may resort cumulatively, or in the alternative:</p>
          <p id="s1p521">(a) Landlord may, at Landlord's election, keep this Lease in effect and enforce, by an action at law or in equity, all of its rights and remedies available to Landlord under this Lease including, without limitation, (i) the right to recover the Rent and other sums as they become due by appropriate legal action, (ii) the right to make payments required by Tenant, or perform Tenant's obligations and be reimbursed by Tenant for the cost thereof with interest at the lesser of Comerica Prime Plus Two or the then maximum rate of interest not prohibited by law from the date the sum is paid by Landlord until Landlord is reimbursed by Tenant, and (iii) the remedies of injunctive relief and specific performance to prevent Tenant from violating the terms of this Lease and/or to compel Tenant to perform its obligations under this Lease, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p522">(b) Landlord may, at Landlord's election, terminate this Lease by giving Tenant written notice of termination, in which event this Lease shall terminate on the date set forth for termination in</p>

          <p id="s1p524">such notice, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Leased Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails to do so, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in Rent, enter upon and take possession of the Leased Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying the Leased Premises or any part thereof, without being liable for prosecution or any claim or damages therefor. Any termination under this subparagraph shall not relieve Tenant from its obligation to pay to Landlord all Expense Rent and Additional Rent then or thereafter due, or any other sums due or thereafter accruing to Landlord, or from any claim against Tenant for damages previously accrued or then or thereafter accruing. In no event shall any one or more of the following actions by Landlord, in the absence of a written election by Landlord to terminate this Lease, constitute a termination of this Lease:</p>
          <p id="s1p525">(i) Appointment of a receiver or keeper in order to protect Landlord's interest hereunder;</p>
          <p id="s1p526">(ii) Consent to any subletting of the Leased Premises or assignment of this Lease by Tenant, whether pursuant to the provisions hereof or otherwise; or</p>
          <p id="s1p527">(iii) Any action taken by Landlord or Landlord Parties which is intended to mitigate the adverse effects of any breach of this Lease by Tenant, including, without limitation, any action taken to maintain and preserve the Leased Premises on any action taken to relet the Leased Premises or any portion thereof for the account at Tenant and in the name of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p528">(c) In the event Tenant breaches this Lease and abandons the Leased Premises, Landlord may terminate this Lease, but this Lease shall not terminate unless Landlord gives Tenant written notice of termination. If Landlord does not terminate this Lease by giving written notice of termination, Landlord may enforce all its rights and remedies under this Lease, including the right and remedies provided by California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (&quot;lessor may continue lease in effect after lessee's breach and abandonment and recover Rent as it becomes due, if lessee has right to sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations&quot;), as in effect on the Effective Date of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p529">(d) In the event Landlord terminates this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled, at Landlord's election, to the rights and remedies provided in California Civil Code Section 1951.2, as in effect on the Effective Date of this Lease. For purposes of computing damages pursuant to Section 1951.2, an interest rate equal to the maximum rate of interest then not prohibited by law shall be used where permitted. Such damages shall include, without limitation:</p>
          <p id="s1p530">(i) The worth at the time of the award of the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination;</p>
          <p id="s1p531">(ii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided, computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, at the time of award plus one percent; and</p>
          <p id="s1p532">(iii) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform Tenant's obligations under this Lease, or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.</p>
          <p id="s1p533">12.3 Landlord's Default And Tenant's Remedies. In the event Landlord fails to perform its obligations under this Lease, Landlord shall nevertheless not be in default under the terms of this Lease until such time as Tenant shall have first given Landlord written notice specifying the nature of such failure to perform its obligations, and then only after Landlord shall have had thirty (30) days following its receipt of such notice within which to perform such obligations; provided that, if longer</p>
          <p id="s1p534">25</p>
          <p id="s1p535">than thirty (30) days is reasonably required in order to perform such obligations, Landlord shall have such longer period so long as Landlord is diligently pursuing such performance up to a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) days. In the event of Landlord's default as above set forth, then, and only then, Tenant may then proceed in equity or at law to seek a termination of this Lease or to compel Landlord to perform its obligations and/or to recover damages proximately caused by such failure to perform (except as and to the extent Tenant has waived its right to damages as provided in this Lease).</p>
          <p id="s1p536">12.4 Limitation Of Tenant's Recourse. Tenant's sole recourse against Landlord for a breach of this Lease shall be to Landlord's interest in the Building and the Common Areas. If Landlord is a corporation, trust, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, unincorporated association, or other form of business entity, Tenant agrees that (i) the obligations of Landlord under this Lease shall not constitute personal obligations of the officers, directors, trustees, partners, joint venturers, members, owners, stockholders, or other principals of such business entity, and (ii) Tenant shall have recourse only to the interest of such corporation, trust, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, unincorporated association, or other form of business entity in the Building and the Common Areas for the satisfaction of such obligations and not against the assets of such officers, directors, trustees, partners, joint venturers, members, owners, stockholders or principals. Additionally, if Landlord is a partnership or limited liability company, then Tenant covenants and agrees:</p>
          <p id="s1p537">(a) No partner or member of Landlord shall be sued or named as a party in any suit or action brought by Tenant with respect to any alleged breach of this Lease (except to the extent necessary to secure jurisdiction over the partnership and then only for that sole purpose);</p>
          <p id="s1p538">(b) No service of process shall be made against any partner or member of Landlord except for the sole purpose of securing jurisdiction over the partnership; and \</p>
          <p id="s1p539">(c) No writ of execution will ever be levied against the assets of any partner or member of Landlord other than to the extent of his or her interest in the assets of the partnership or limited liability company constituting Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p540">Tenant further agrees that each of the foregoing covenants and agreements shall be enforceable by Landlord and by any partner or member of Landlord and shall be applicable to any actual or alleged misrepresentation or nondisclosure made regarding this Lease or the Leased Premises or any actual or alleged failure, default or breach of any covenant or agreement either expressly or implicitly contained in this Lease or imposed by statute or at common law.</p>
          <p id="s1p541">12.5 Tenant's Waiver. Landlord and Tenant agree that the provisions of Paragraph 12.3 above are intended to supersede and replace the provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1932(1), 1941 and 1942, and accordingly, Tenant hereby waives the provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1932(1), 1941 and 1942 and/or any similar or successor law regarding Tenant's right to terminate this Lease or to make repairs and deduct the expenses of such repairs from the Rent due under this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p543">GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
          <p id="s1p544">13.1 Taxes On Tenant's Property. Tenant shall pay before delinquency any and all taxes, assessments, license fees, use fees, permit fees and public charges of whatever nature or description levied, assessed or imposed against Tenant's personal property located at the Property, any improvements or alterations Tenant makes to the Leased Premises, and Tenant's interest in this Lease (collectively, &quot;Tenant's Interest&quot;). Upon demand by Landlord, Tenant shall furnish Landlord with satisfactory evidence of these payments. If any such taxes, assessments, fees or public charges are levied against Landlord, Landlord's property, the Building or the Property, or if the assessed value of the Building or the Property is increased by the inclusion therein of a value placed upon Tenant's Interest, regardless of the validity thereof, Landlord shall have the right to require Tenant to pay such taxes, and</p>
          <p id="s1p545">26</p>
          <p id="s1p546">if not paid and satisfactory evidence of payment delivered to Landlord at least ten days prior to delinquency, then Landlord shall have the right to pay such taxes on Tenant's behalf and to invoice Tenant for the same, in either case whether before or after the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term. Tenant shall, within the earlier to occur of (a) thirty (30) days of the date it receives an invoice from Landlord setting forth the amount of such taxes, assessments, fees, or public charge so levied, or (b) the due date of such invoice, pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the amount set forth in such invoice. Failure by Tenant to pay the amount so invoiced within such time period shall be conclusively deemed a default by Tenant under this Lease. Tenant shall have the right to bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover from the taxing authority the amount of any such taxes, assessments, fees or public charges so paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right before any delinquency occurs to contest or object to the amount or validity of any of the taxes or impositions referred to in this Paragraph 13.1 by appropriate legal proceedings, provided that such right shall in no way be construed in any way as relieving, modifying, or extending Tenant's covenant to pay such taxes and impositions at the time and manner required by this Paragraph 13.1. Landlord shall not be required to join in any such proceedings and Landlord shall not be subjected to any liability for the payment of any costs or expenses in connection with such proceedings brought by Tenant, and Tenant covenants to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from any such costs and expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p547">13.2 Holding Over. This Lease shall terminate without further notice on the Lease Expiration Date (as set forth in Article 1). Any holding over by Tenant after expiration of the Lease Term shall neither constitute a renewal nor extension of this Lease nor give Tenant any rights in or to the Leased Premises except as expressly provided in this Paragraph. Any such holding over to which Landlord has consented shall be construed to be a tenancy from month to month, on the same terms and conditions herein specified insofar as applicable, except that the Expense Rent shall be increased to an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the fair market rent for the Leased Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p548">13.3 Transfer By Landlord. Landlord and its successors in interest shall have the right to transfer their interest in the Building, the Property, or any portion thereof at any time and to any person or entity. In the event of any such transfer, the Landlord originally named herein (and in the case of any subsequent transfer, the transferor), from the date of such transfer shall be automatically relieved, without any further act by any person or entity, of all liability for the performance of the obligations of the Landlord hereunder which may accrue after the date of such transfer provided such transferee assumes responsibility to cure continuing defaults of Landlord hereunder. Tenant shall attorn to any such transferee. After the date of any such transfer, the term &quot;Landlord&quot; as used herein shall mean the transferee of such interest in the Building or the Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p549">13.4 Force Majeure. The obligations of each of the parties under this Lease (other than the obligations to pay money) shall be temporarily excused if such party, for reasons beyond the party's reasonable control, is prevented or delayed in performing such obligations by reason of any strikes, lockouts or labor disputes; government restrictions, regulations, controls, action or inaction; civil commotion; or extraordinary weather, fire or other acts of God.</p>

          <p id="s1p571">13.7 General Waivers. One party's consent to or approval of any act by the other party requiring the first party's consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the first party's consent to or approval of any subsequent similar act by the other party. No waiver of any provision hereof, or any waiver of any breach of any provision hereof, shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving party. The receipt by Landlord of any Rent or payment with or without knowledge of the breach of any other provision hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of any such breach. No waiver of any provision of this Lease shall be deemed a continuing waiver unless such waiver specifically states so in writing and is signed by both Landlord and Tenant. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy accruing to either party upon any breach by the other party under this Lease shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver of any such breach theretofore or thereafter occurring. The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Lease shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions herein contained.</p>

Should any provisions of this Lease prove to be invalid or illegal, such invalidity or illegality shall in no way affect, impair or invalidate any other provisions hereof, and such remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Time is of the essence with respect to the performance of every provision of this Lease in which time of performance is a factor. Any copy of this Lease which is executed by the parties shall be deemed an original for all purposes. This Lease shall, subject to the provisions regarding assignment, apply to and bind the respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns of Landlord and Tenant. The term &quot;party&quot; shall mean Landlord or Tenant as the context implies. If Tenant consists of more than one person or entity, then all members of Tenant shall be jointly and severally liable hereunder. Notwithstanding any inconsistent</p>
          <p id="s1p573">28</p>
          <p id="s1p574">language contained in any other document, this Lease is not effective as a lease or otherwise until execution and delivery by both Landlord and Tenant. This Lease shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State in which the Leased Premises are located. The captions in this Lease are for convenience only and shall not be construed in the construction or interpretation of any provision hereof.

When a party is required to do something by this Lease, it shall do so at its sole cost and expense without right of reimbursement from the other party unless specific provision is made therefor. Landlord and Tenant shall both be deemed to have drafted this Lease, and the rule of construction that a document is to be construed against the drafting party shall not be employed in the construction or interpretation of this Lease. Where Tenant is obligated not to perform any act or is not permitted to perform any act, Tenant is also obligated to restrain any others reasonably within its control, including agents, invitees, contractors, subcontractors and employees, from performing such act. Landlord shall not become or be deemed a partner or a joint venturer with Tenant by reason of any of the provisions of this Lease. This Lease may be executed in one or more counterparts.

Tenant expressly waives any and all claims for damage by reason of any statement, representation, warranty, promise or other agreement of Landlord or Landlord's agent(s), if any, not contained in this Lease or in any Exhibit attached hereto.</p>

This Lease is subject to and subordinate to all ground leases, mortgages and deeds of trust which affect the Building or the Property and which are of public record as of the Effective Date of this Lease, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof. However, if the lessor under any such ground lease or any lender holding any such mortgage or deed of trust shall advise Landlord that it desires or requires this Lease to be made prior and superior thereto, then, upon written request of Landlord to Tenant, Tenant shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all customary or reasonable documents or instruments which Landlord and such lessor or lender deems necessary or desirable to make this Lease prior thereto. Tenant hereby consents to Landlord's ground leasing the land underlying the Building or the Property and/or encumbering the Building or the Property as security for future loans on such terms as Landlord shall desire, all of which future ground leases, mortgages or deeds of trust shall be subject to and subordinate to this Lease. However, if any lessor under any such future ground lease or any lender holding such future mortgage or deed of trust shall desire or require that this Lease be made subject to and subordinate to such future ground lease, mortgage or deed of trust, then Tenant agrees, within ten days after Landlord's written request therefor, to execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord any and all documents or instruments requested by Landlord or by such lessor or lender as may be necessary or proper to assure the subordination of this Lease to such future ground lease, mortgage or deed of trust, but only if such lessor or lender agrees not to disturb Tenant's quiet possession of the Leased Premises so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease.
