Tenant acknowledges that late payments by Tenant to Landlord of such rent and other charges will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of such costs being extremely difficult and impracticable to fix. Therefore, if any installment of rent due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within five (5) days from when due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) as a late charge.
