The Premises consist of approximately 22,178 square feet, a measurement determined solely for the purposes of this Lease. The Premises are shown cross-hatched on the plan attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit A-1. The Premises shall not be deemed to include either the land lying thereunder or the exterior walls or roof of the building in which said Premises are located or any area beyond the midpoint of any interior wall. Landlord reserves the use of said land, walls and roof of the building, together with the right to install, maintain, use, repair and replace pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and structural elements leading through the Premises in locations which will not materially interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises. 1.02 Shopping Center The Shopping Center includes: (i) the parcel(s) of land and improvements hereinafter referred to as &quot;Landlord's Tract&quot; generally depicted on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof, whether owned in fee or ground leased by Landlord and (ii) the parcel(s) of land and improvements, if any, generally depicted on Exhibit A as &quot;REA Parcel&quot; made available for use by any reciprocal construction operating and easement agreement (&quot;REA&quot;). Landlord reserves the right to add to or sever the ownership of or title to any portion of the Shopping Center or to add to or reduce the size of any REA Parcel at any time. No representation is made or implied that Landlord has title to the Premises at the time of execution of this Lease. It is agreed that the depiction of the Shopping Center on Exhibit A does not constitute a representation, covenant or warranty of any kind by Landlord. Landlord, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to expand or remodel the Shopping Center and to change the configuration, size and dimensions of the Shopping Center, the number, location and dimensions of buildings, parking areas, driveways, entrances, exits and landscaped areas, the number of floors in any of the buildings, the dimensions, identity, and type of stores or tenancies, and, as provided in Section 7.02, the &quot;Common Areas&quot; (defined in Section 7.01). 1.03 Use of Premises and Trade Name Tenant shall operate the Premises under the trade name &quot;HoloWorld Cafe&quot; and shall use the Premises solely for the purpose of conducting the business of a theme restaurant.

The Premises shall be used for no other purpose whatsoever. 2 ARTICLE 2 Term of Lease 2.01 Commencement of Term (a) The term of this Lease shall commence 180 days following delivery of possession of the Premises to Tenant (hereinafter called &quot;Term Commencement Date&quot;), provided, however, that if Tenant opens for the conduct of its business in the Premises earlier than the date specified, the term of this Lease shall then commence upon the date Tenant opens for the conduct of its business in the Premises. After thirty days from the date Landlord delivers possession of the Premises to Tenant, the Term Commencement Date shall be extended for each day Tenant has not obtained a building permit, provided Tenant has submitted a building permit application and completed building permit plans not later than January 15, 2001. (b) Tenant acknowledges the importance both to Landlord and the other tenants of the Shopping Center of Tenant's opening for business to the public on the Term Commencement Date. In the event Tenant fails to open for business at the Premises on or before the Term Commencement Date or, if the Term Commencement Date has been rescheduled by Landlord, on or before the rescheduled Term Commencement Date, Tenant covenants and agrees to pay to Landlord, upon receipt of notice from Landlord of the amount due under this Section 2.01(b), as liquidated damages suffered by Landlord due to Tenant's failure to open, a sum (in addition to any rent due hereunder) equal to one and one half times the per diem Fixed Monthly Minimum Rent (using a thirty (30) day month) provided in Section 3.01(a) for each and every business day that Tenant has failed to open for business beyond July 1, 2001. 2.02 Term of Lease The term of this Lease shall expire on the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Term Commencement Date, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions herein. 2.03 Option to Extend; Expiration of Term ( 2 five-year Options) If on the date the applicable Extension Notice (as hereinafter defined) is given and on the first day of the applicable Extended Term (as hereinafter defined) (i) this Lease is in full force and effect, and (ii) Tenant is not in default of any of the terms, covenants or conditions required to be observed or performed by Tenant under this Lease; then Tenant shall have the right to extend (an &quot;Extension Option&quot;) the term of this Lease for two (2) additional periods of sixty months each (each additional period, an &quot;Extended Term&quot;), provided that written notice (the &quot;Extension Notice&quot;) of the election shall be sent to Landlord by Tenant not more than twelve (12) months and not less than nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the then existing Term (as hereinafter defined), time being of the essence with respect to the date of delivery of such notice. Each Extended Term shall be upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in this Lease for the initial term hereof, except that (1) Fixed Annual Minimum Rent for and during any Extended Term shall be equal to the Fixed Annual Minimum Rent set forth in Section 3.01 with respect to such Extended Term, (2) Tenant shall have no right to extend the term of this Lease for any period of time beyond the expiration of the two 3 (2) Extended Terms referred to above, and (3) Tenant shall have no right to elect the second Extended Term if it has not previously timely elected, and qualified for, the first Extended Term in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.03. The word &quot;Term&quot; means the initial term of this Lease together with each and every Extended Term (if any) that is timely elected, and qualified for in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.03. If the term of this Lease would expire during the period September 1 through the last day of February, the parties agree that the termination date shall be the immediately preceding August 31. 204 Surrender of Premises On the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant agrees, without necessity of any notices from Landlord (statutory or otherwise), to surrender the Premises in accordance with Article 9, and broom clean and in good order, repair and condition, reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire or casualty excepted. ARTICLE 3 Rent 3.01 Minimum Rent (a) Tenant agrees to pay Landlord, without diminution, deduction or set-off whatsoever and without prior notice or demand, and as fixed annual minimum rent (&quot;Fixed Annual Minimum Rent&quot;), the sums set forth in Section 3.01(a)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) below payable in equal consecutive monthly installments (&quot;Fixed Monthly Minimum Rent&quot;) each in advance upon the first day of each calendar month during the term hereof. (i) From the Term Commencement Date through the end of the sixtieth (60th) full month of the Lease term, Fixed Annual Minimum Rent shall be Four Hundred Seventy Eight Thousand Six Hundred One and 00/100 Dollars ($478,601.00), payable in equal monthly installments of Thirty Nine Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty Three and 00/1 00 Dollars ($39,883.00) each; and (ii) From the first day of the sixty first (61st) full month of the Lease term through the end of the one hundred and twentieth (120th) full month of the Lease term, Fixed Annual Minimum Rent shall be Five Hundred Two Thousand Five Hundred Fifty Three and 00/100 Dollars ($502,553.00), payable in equal monthly installments of Forty One Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy Nine and 00/100 Dollars ($41,879.00) each; and (iii) From the first day of the one hundred and twenty-first (121st) full month of the Lease term through the end of the Lease term, Fixed Annual Minimum Rent shall be Five Hundred Twenty Seven Thousand Six Hundred Fourteen and 00/100 Dollars ($527,614.00), payable in equal monthly installments of Forty Three Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty Seven and 00/100 Dollars ($43,967.00) each. 4 (iv) Provided Tenant exercises its first Extension Option, from the first day of Tenant's first Extended Term through the end of the sixtieth fully month of Tenant's first Extended Term, Fixed Annual Minimum Rent shall be Five Hundred Fifty Three Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety Four and 70/100 Dollars ($553,994.70) payable in advance, in equal monthly installments of Forty Six Thousand One Hundred Sixty Six and 23/100 Dollars ($46,166.23) each; and (v) Provided Tenant exercises its second Extension Option, from the first day of Tenant's second Extended Term through the sixtieth full month of Tenant's second Extended Term, an annual amount of Five Hundred Eighty One Thousand Six Hundred Ninety Four and 44/100 ($581,694.44) payable in advance in equal monthly installments of Forty Eight Thousand Four Hundred Seventy Four and 54/100 Dollars ($48,474.54) each. (b) If the term shall commence upon a day other than the first day of a calendar month or if the term shall terminate upon a day other than the last day of a calendar month, then Tenant shall pay, upon the Term Commencement Date, and on the first day of the last calendar month, a pro rata portion of the Fixed Monthly Minimum Rent for the first and last fractional calendar months of the term. 3.02 Percentage Rent (a) In addition to Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Tenant shall, in the manner, upon the conditions and at the times hereinafter set forth, pay to Landlord percentage rent (&quot;Percentage Rent&quot;) equal to ten percent (10%) of &quot;Gross Receipts&quot; (defined in Section 3.03) in excess of Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000) (&quot;Annual Minimum Gross Receipts&quot;) per &quot;Lease Year&quot; (defined in Section 3.10). Percentage Rent shall be payable as hereinafter provided without any diminution, deduction or set-off whatsoever, except as provided in Section 3.02(b), and without prior notice or demand. (b) Percentage Rent, if any, for the first Lease Year or Partial Lease Year shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within thirty (30) days after the last day of such Lease Year or Partial Lease Year. During the second and each subsequent Lease Year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord monthly, on the first day of each month during such Lease Year, an amount equal to one-twelfth the amount of Percentage Rent, if any, payable during the immediately preceding Lease Year or Partial Lease Year. Within thirty (30) days after the end of the second and each subsequent Lease Year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum by which the actual amount of Percentage Rent due Landlord for such Lease Year exceeds the total payments made by Tenant during the preceding Lease Year, however, if such total payment exceeds one-twelfth (1/12th) the actual amount of Percentage Rent then due, Tenant shall apply such excess to the next ensuing payments of Percentage Rent otherwise due to Landlord until such excess is recouped by Tenant. Landlord shall reimburse to Tenant any such excess remaining at the expiration of the term. 5 (c) If the date Tenant initially opens for business in the Premises is other than the first day of a Lease Year, then Percentage Rent attributable to the period between such initial opening date and the first day of the first Lease Year shall be based on Gross Receipts in excess of the Annual Minimum Gross Receipts reduced on a pro rata basis for such period. 3.03 Gross Receipts Defined The term &quot;Gross Receipts&quot; as used herein is hereby defined to mean receipts from gross sales from all business conducted in any manner at, in, on, from or arising out of the Premises (including any additional space hereafter licensed by Landlord to Tenant pursuant to separate agreement) by Tenant and all others (including all licensees, concessionaires and tenants of Tenant), and whether such sales be evidenced by check, credit, charge account, exchange or otherwise, and shall include, but not be limited to, the amounts received from the sale or rental of goods, wares and merchandise, and for services performed on the Premises, together with the amount of all orders taken or received at the Premises, whether such orders be filled from the Premises or elsewhere, and whether such sales be made by means of merchandise or other vending devices in or relating to the Premises. If any one or more departments or other divisions of Tenant's business shall be sublet by Tenant or conducted by any person, firm or corporation other than Tenant, then there shall be included in the Gross Receipts for the purpose of determining the Percentage Rent payable hereunder all of the gross sales of such departments or divisions in the same manner and with the same effect as if the business or sales of such departments and divisions had been conducted by Tenant itself. Gross Receipts shall not include sales of merchandise returned and claimed to be defective or unsatisfactory, provided such sales have been included in Gross Receipts and there shall be deducted from Gross Receipts the sales price of merchandise returned by customers for exchange, provided that the sales price of merchandise delivered to the customer in exchange is included in Gross Receipts. Gross Receipts shall not include the amount of any sales, use or gross receipts tax imposed by any federal, state, municipal or governmental authority directly on sales and collected from customers, provided that the amount thereof is separately added to the selling price and paid by Tenant to such governmental authority. No franchise or capital stock tax and no income or similar tax based upon income or profits as such shall be deducted from Gross Receipts in any event whatsoever. Each charge or sale upon installment or credit shall be treated as a sale for the full price in the month during which such charge or sale shall be made, irrespective of the time when Tenant shall receive payment (whether full or partial) therefor. 3.04 Tenant's Books and Records Tenant agrees to prepare, maintain and keep on the Premises or at its principal office for a period of not less than three (3) years following the end of each Lease Year, accurate books of account and records of daily Gross Receipts, including without limitation all federal, state and local tax returns, and copies of relevant contracts, checks, vouchers, inventory records, dated cash register tapes, sales slips and such other documentation as would enable Landlord to make a full and complete audit of Gross Receipts (&quot;Books and Records&quot;). Landlord and Landlord's authorized representatives shall have the right to examine Tenant's Books and Records during regular business hours. Tenant agrees that all Gross Receipts shall be registered at the time each sale or transaction is made in cash registers or other devices or other electronic or technology based systems containing locked-in cumulation capacity satisfactory to Landlord. 6 3.05 Reports by Tenant Within twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar month, or portion thereof, during the term of this Lease, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord a written statement setting forth the amount of Gross Receipts and an itemization of any deductions or exclusions therefrom for such previous month. Tenant also agrees that it will furnish to Landlord within forty-five (45) days after the end of each Lease Year or Partial Lease Year, an annual statement, showing in all reasonable detail the amount of Gross Receipts and an itemization of any deductions or exclusions therefrom relating to such Lease Year or Partial Lease Year and the amount of Percentage Rent due Landlord. Each monthly and annual statement required by this Section 3.05 shall be certified by one of Tenant's knowledgeable, authorized, executive officers or if Tenant is an individual, by Tenant and shall be subject to further certification as provided in Section 3.07. In the event Tenant fails to furnish Landlord with a monthly or annual statement within the required time period and in the manner set forth in this Section 3.05, then the Gross Receipts for such month or year, as the case may be, shall, at Landlord's option, be deemed to be equal to Tenant's highest previously reported monthly or annual Gross Receipts, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as liquidated damages, the sum of One Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($100.00) per month until such statement is received. In addition, if Tenant is delinquent in furnishing Landlord with monthly statements of Gross Receipts for two (2) consecutive months or is delinquent in furnishing Landlord the annual statement of Gross Receipts, any subsequent audit the Landlord conducts shall be at Tenant's expense. In addition, if Tenant is delinquent in furnishing Landlord with Tenant's annual statement of Gross Receipts within ninety (90) days following the end of any Lease Year, Landlord shall have the right, at its option, to terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days' written notice to Tenant of such termination, whereupon at the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, unless Tenant shall have theretofore delivered to Landlord Tenant's annual statement of Gross Receipts, the term of this Lease shall expire as fully and completely as if such early termination date were the original expiration date without further action or notice by Landlord. 3.06 Non-Waiver The acceptance by Landlord of payments of Percentage Rent and statements of Gross Receipts shall be without prejudice to Landlord's right to examine Tenant's Books and Records in order to verify the amounts thereof. 3.07 Right to Examine and Audit Books and Records At its option, Landlord may conduct, at any reasonable time upon seven (7) days' prior written notice to Tenant, a complete audit to be made of the Books and Records (including the books and records of any subtenant, operator, concessionaire or licensee or of any other store operated by Tenant) for the period covered by any statement required to be furnished by Tenant as set forth above. In the event such examination discloses that Tenant has understated or overstated Gross Receipts by one percent (1%) or more, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord the reasonable cost of such examination and audit and all future annual 7 statements of Gross Receipts shall be certified by an independent certified public accountant. In the event that such examination or audit discloses that Tenant has understated or overstated Gross Receipts by three percent (3%) or more, then, in addition to the foregoing, at Landlord's option, the term of this Lease shall expire ten (10) days after Tenant's receipt of a termination notice from Landlord. Any additional Percentage Rent found to be due and owing to Landlord as a result of any examination or audit shall immediately be due and payable with interest. 3.08 Delinquent Payments If during the term of this Lease Tenant fails to pay the full amount of the Fixed Monthly Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent or &quot;Additional Rent&quot; (defined in Section 3.09) when the same is due and payable, then interest at the monthly rate of two percent (2%) per month or the maximum rate then permitted by law, whichever is less, shall accrue on the unpaid amount from and after the date on which any such sum shall be due and payable, and such interest, together with a Late Charge of Fifty and 00/100 Dollars ($50.00) for each past due payment to cover the extra expense involved in handling such delinquency, shall be paid to Landlord at the time of payment of the delinquent sum. If the term of this Lease is longer than five years, then the Late Charge shall be increased to One Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($100.00) for each past due payment incurred on or after the commencement of the sixth Lease Year. Landlord shall have the right to apply any payments made by Tenant first to any deficiency in the payment of the interest and administrative charges provided for hereunder. Any payment to be made by Tenant under this Lease shall be deemed to have been paid upon the date that it is received by Landlord. The provision for a Late Charge and interest herein shall not be deemed to grant Tenant any grace period or extension of time or prevent Landlord from exercising its other rights under this Lease. Tenant shall pay to Landlord an administrative fee of Fifty and 00/100 Dollars ($50.00) for each and every check submitted by Tenant which is dishonored. If Landlord receives from Tenant two or more checks which have been dishonored, all checks from Tenant thereafter shall, at Landlord's option, be either certified or cashier's checks. 3.09 Additional Rent All rents, charges, costs, expenses, reimbursements, fees, interest, and other payments to be made by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease, other than Fixed Annual Minimum Rent and Percentage Rent, shall be deemed to be &quot;Additional Rent.&quot; 3.10 Definition of Lease Year and Partial Lease Year The term &quot;Lease Year&quot; is defined to mean a period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months commencing on the first day of January. Any portion of the term which is less than a Lease Year shall be deemed a &quot;Partial Lease Year&quot; and computations requiring proration shall be made on a per diem basis using a 365 day year. In order to achieve uniformity in the operation of the Shopping Center, Landlord reserves the right to designate and change the beginning and ending day of the Lease Year, notice of which shall be given to Tenant. 8 3.11 Place for Payments (a) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord all payments of Fixed Monthly Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent and Additional Rent at the office of Landlord shown at the beginning of this Lease or such other place as may be designated by Landlord. ARTICLE 4 Taxes 4.01 Real Property Taxes (a) Landlord will pay in the first instance all real property taxes (which shall include property tax assessments, water and sewer rent rates and charges, parking and environmental surcharges, and any other governmental charges, general and special, ordinary and extraordinary) which may be levied or assessed by any lawful authority against land or improvements located in the Shopping Center (collectively &quot;Real Property Taxes&quot;). The amounts required to be paid by Landlord or any tenant or occupant of the Shopping Center pursuant to any Payment in Lieu of Tax Agreement entered into with a taxing authority having jurisdiction over the Shopping Center shall be considered for the purposes of this Lease to be included within the definition of Real Property Taxes. (b) During the term of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, Tenant's Allocable Share of all Real Property Taxes. Tenant's Allocable Share shall be computed under Section 23.03(b) as of the first day of each respective Lease Year. If the Premises are separately assessed, then Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the amount of the Real Property Taxes separately assessed against the Premises including the land lying thereunder plus Tenant's Allocable Share of the Real Property Taxes assessed against the Common Areas of the Shopping Center. (c) Tenant agrees that following the Term Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent and within ten (10) days after receipt of a bill therefor, the amount of Tenant's Allocable Share of all Real Property Taxes, computed as of the Term Commencement Date for the then current tax fiscal year(s). Such amount shall be calculated on the basis of the number of days (from the Term Commencement Date) remaining in each such current tax fiscal year. Thereafter, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, all sums due pursuant to Section 4.01(b) in monthly installments, in advance and without notice, on or before the first day of each month during the term of this Lease, in an amount estimated by Landlord, such that Landlord will have received the full amount of Tenant's Allocable Share of Real Property Taxes in time for payment to applicable taxing authority when due. In the event Landlord is required to escrow Real Property Taxes, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, use the amount required to be escrowed as a basis for its estimate of the monthly installments due from Tenant hereunder. Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a written statement of the actual amount of Tenant's Allocable Share of Real Property Taxes based upon the tax bills or assessment bills for each tax fiscal year. If the total amount paid by Tenant under this Section 4.01(c) for any tax fiscal year during the term of this Lease is less than the actual amount due from Tenant for such year as shown on such statement, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the deficiency within ten (10) days after demand therefor by Landlord. If the total amount paid by Tenant hereunder for any year exceeds the amount due from Tenant for such year, Tenant shall be entitled to offset the excess against payments next thereafter becoming due under this Section 4.01(c). For the tax 9 fiscal years in which this Lease commences and terminates, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply and, to the extent necessary, Tenant's liability for its Allocable Share of any Real Property Taxes for such year shall be subject to a pro rata adjustment based on the appropriate number of days of said tax fiscal years. A copy of a tax bill or assessment bill submitted by Landlord to Tenant shall at all times be sufficient evidence of the amount of Real Property Taxes to which such bill relates. (d) In an attempt to control the costs for off-site improvements which are required by governmental authorities for the development, operation or expansion of the Shopping Center (for example: highway improvements, sewer and water facilities), Landlord may agree with such governmental authorities to be responsible for the construction of such off-site improvements. In such case, upon notice from Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent and in lieu of any special district real estate taxes relating to such improvements which could otherwise be imposed against the Shopping Center if such improvements were constructed under governmental responsibility, an annual charge representing Tenant's Allocable Share of the amortized cost of such facilities. Tenant's Allocable Share of such costs shall be computed in the same manner as used to compute Tenant's Allocable Share of Real Property Taxes as provided in Section 4.01(b) above. This annual charge shall be paid by Tenant in equal monthly installments, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month during the term of this Lease. (e) Landlord may seek a reduction in the assessed valuation (for Real Property Tax purposes) of the Shopping Center or any portion thereof by administrative or legal proceeding. Tenant shall pay to Landlord Tenant's Allocable Share of Landlord's costs for said proceedings, including counsel fees, appraisal fees and other similar expenses, within ten (10) days after Tenant's receipt of a statement from Landlord therefor. Tenant's Allocable Share of such costs shall be computed under Section 23.03(b) hereof. Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for Tenant's Allocable Share of any refund of Real Property Taxes (after deducting any unpaid portion of Tenant's Allocable Share of Landlord's costs for such proceedings) resulting from any proceeding for which Tenant has paid Tenant's Allocable Share of Real Property Taxes. (f) Should any alteration or improvement performed by or for Tenant during the term of this Lease cause an increase in assessment, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the full cost of all Real Property Taxes resulting from such increase in assessment. Any amount paid separately hereunder by Tenant to Landlord shall be in addition to any amounts paid by Tenant pursuant to Section 4.01(b). (g) Should any governmental taxing authority acting under any present or future law, ordinance or regulation, levy, assess or impose a tax, excise, surcharge or assessment upon or against the rents payable by Tenant to Landlord, or upon or against the Common Areas, whether by way of substitution for or in addition to any existing Real Property Tax or otherwise, Tenant shall 10 be responsible for and shall pay Tenant's Allocable Share of such tax in the manner provided in Section 4.01(c). 4.02 Tenant's Taxes Tenant shall, at all times, be responsible for and pay, before delinquency, all municipal, county, state or federal taxes charged against Tenant's income, sales, fixtures, furnishings, equipment, stock-in-trade or other personal property of any kind owned, installed or used in or on the Premises, and any tax now or hereafter charged against Tenant on any other basis.

ARTICLE 12 Insurance 12.01. Liability Insurance Throughout the term of this Lease, Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, for the mutual benefit of Landlord and Tenant, shall maintain personal injury and property damage liability insurance against claims for personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on, in or about the Premises, or arising from, in or about Tenant's use of the Common Areas, or resulting from or arising out of products sold from the Premises or Tenant's use of the Common Areas during the term of this Lease, of not less than Three Million and 00/100 Dollars ($3,000,000.00) in respect of personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage (combined single limit). Such policy shall expressly contain a contractual endorsement to provide coverage for Tenant's indemnification set forth in Section 11.01 of this Lease and shall contain the 22 &quot;Per Location Aggregate&quot; endorsement. Such policy shall be endorsed (1) as primary and (2) to waive rights of subrogation against Landlord. Prior to the Term Commencement Date, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a certificate containing evidence of such coverage and of the coverage required in Sections 12.02(c) and (d) below, and Tenant shall thereafter provide Landlord with appropriate evidence of said coverage upon each anniversary date of the policy. In the event that Tenant fails to provide the certificate as set forth herein or fails to provide such evidence of such coverage at least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration date of each expiring policy, Landlord may obtain such insurance at Tenant's sole cost and expense and upon demand of Landlord, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of procuring such insurance coverage together with eighteen percent (18%) for administration costs. 12.02. Special Causes of Loss and Difference in Conditions Insurance (a) At all times during the term of this Lease, Landlord shall keep all Permanent Improvements, as hereinafter defined, insured for the benefit of Landlord against loss or damage by risks now or hereafter embraced by &quot;Special Causes of Loss&quot; and &quot;Difference in Conditions&quot; coverages and against such other risks as Landlord from time to time reasonably may designate in amounts sufficient to prevent Landlord from becoming a coinsurer under the terms of the applicable policies. In any event, the amount applicable to &quot;Special Causes of Loss&quot; policies shall be not less than ninety percent (90%) of the &quot;Then Full Replacement Cost&quot; (being the cost of replacing the Permanent Improvements exclusive of the costs of excavations and footings below the lowest grade level). The Then Full Replacement Cost shall be determined from time to time (but not more frequently than once in any twelve (12) calendar months) by an appraiser, architect or other person or firm designated by Landlord. (b) The Permanent Improvements for purposes of this Section 12.02 shall be deemed to mean the building in which the Premises is situated, the appurtenances thereto and the equipment and other improvements constructed by Landlord and Tenant pursuant to Exhibits B and C. Such Permanent Improvements shall exclude, however, Tenant's merchandise, trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment, wall covering, carpeting, drapes, and all personal property (collectively &quot;Tenant's Personal Property&quot;). Tenants shall provide Landlord with a certificate setting forth the cost of Tenant's Work no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the Term Commencement Date. (c) At all times during the term of this Lease, Tenant shall keep all of Tenant's Personal Property situated at or on the Premises, insured with &quot;Special Causes of Loss&quot; and &quot;Difference in Conditions&quot; and &quot;Plate Glass&quot; coverages for not less than the full replacement cost thereof, with any deductible but not to exceed One Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000.00) on &quot;Plate Glass&quot; and &quot;Special Causes of Loss&quot; and Ten Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($10,000.00) on &quot;Difference in Conditions&quot; policies.

If and to the extent Landlord elects to self insure up to the first One Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000.00) of any claims for personal injury or bodily injury, or under Workers' Compensation, there shall be included within insurance costs the amount of any personal injury, bodily injury or Workers' Compensation claim(s) or judgment(s) paid by Landlord, limited, however, in each instance to the lesser of (i) One Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000.00), or (ii) the self insured amount of such claim or judgment. 12.04. Increase in Fire Insurance Premium Tenant covenants and agrees to promptly pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, upon demand, the amount of any increase in the rate of insurance on the Premises or on any other part of the Shopping Center that results by reason of Tenant's act(s) or Tenant's permitting certain activities to take place. 12.05. Tenant to Share Insurance Costs (a) During the term of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, Tenant's Allocable Share of all insurance costs. Tenant's Allocable Share shall be computed under Section 23.03(b) as of the first day of each respective Lease Year. If insurance costs are separately assessed against the Premises, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the amount of the insurance costs, as estimated by Landlord, separately assessed against the Premises plus Tenant's Allocable Share of the insurance costs, as estimated by Landlord, assessed against the Common Areas of the Shopping Center. (b) Tenant agrees that upon the Term Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent and within ten (10) days after receipt of a bill therefor, the amount of Tenant's Allocable Share of insurance costs for the then current insurance year which have been previously paid by Landlord. Such amount shall be calculated on the basis of the number of days (from the Term Commencement Date) remaining in such current year. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, with respect to each subsequent insurance year, as Additional Rent, all sums due pursuant to Section 12.05(a), in monthly installments, in advance and without notice or demand, on or before the first day of each month during the term of this Lease, in an amount estimated by Landlord, such that Landlord will have received the full amount of Tenant's Allocable Share of insurance costs. If the total amount paid by Tenant under this Section 12.05 for any insurance year during the term of this Lease is less than the actual amount due from Tenant for such year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the deficiency within ten (10) days after demand therefor by Landlord. If the total amount paid by Tenant hereunder for any insurance year exceeds the amount due from Tenant for such year, Tenant shall be entitled to offset the excess against payments next thereafter becoming due under this Section 12.05. For the insurance years in 24 which this Lease commences and terminates, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply and Tenant's liability for its Allocable Share of any insurance for such year shall be subject to a pro rata adjustment based on the number of days of said years during which the term of this Lease is in effect. 12.06. Waiver of Subrogation Each party releases and waives on behalf of itself and on behalf of the insurers of such party's property, any and all claims and any rights of subrogation of any such insurer against the other party, its employees and agents for loss (other than loss or damage resulting from the willful act of such other party, its employees and agents) sustained from any peril to property required to be insured against herein, whether or not such insurance is actually in force, or from any peril to property actually insured against, though not required to be under this Lease. The policies of the respective parties shall contain an express waiver of subrogation to this effect. 12.07 Policies All insurance provided in this Article 12 shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies of at minimum a Best rating of A-, XII and issued by insurers of recognized responsibility which are licensed to do business in the state in which the Shopping Center is located. All of Tenant's policies of insurance as required in this Article 12 shall name Landlord, Tenant, Landlord's managing agent and any mortgagee having an interest in any or all part of the Shopping Center the name and address of which Tenant has received written notice, as additional insureds, as their respective interests may appear. Tenant agrees that such policies shall also be made payable, if required by Landlord, to a mortgagee or ground lessor, as the interest of such mortgagee or ground lessor may appear. The loss, if any, under any policies provided for hereunder may be adjusted with the insurance company by Landlord. Each of Tenant's policies shall contain an agreement by the insurer that such policy shall not be terminated, canceled or reduced in coverage without at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord and to any mortgagee or ground lessor to whom a loss thereunder is payable. The minimum limits of coverage for all of Tenant's policies of insurance required by this Article 12 shall be increased by Tenant if reasonably required by Landlord. ARTICLE 13 Damage by Fire, Etc. 13.01. Restoration of Premises (a) The parties hereto mutually agree that if the Premises are partially or totally destroyed or damaged by fire or otherwise, then Landlord (subject to being able to obtain all necessary permits and approvals therefor) shall repair and restore the Premises as soon as is reasonably practicable to substantially the same condition in which the Premises existed before such damage; provided that if the insurance proceeds collected or collectible and available to Landlord to pay the cost of such repairs and restorations by 25 Landlord as a consequence o such destruction or damage are less than the cost of such repairs and restoration as estimated by Landlord's architect, Landlord shall not be obligated to commence or perform such repairs and restorations, and this Lease upon notice by Landlord to Tenant shall at the option of Landlord terminate unless Tenant undertakes (in form and upon terms satisfactory to Landlord) to pay the difference between such estimated cost and such insurance proceeds. If, however, the Premises are completely destroyed or so damaged that Landlord cannot reasonably restore or rebuild in four (4) months to substantially the same condition in which the Premises were before such damage, then Landlord shall not be required to rebuild or restore, and this Lease shall be terminable by Landlord serving written notice upon Tenant. In any event, if repairs have not been commenced within sixty (60) days after the date on which Landlord receives the insurance proceeds, this Lease may be terminated by Tenant serving notice upon Landlord following the expiration of such sixty (60) days by giving Landlord not less than thirty (30) days' advanced written notice of such election, but in no event may Tenant terminate this Lease after such repairs have been commenced by Landlord. (b) In the event the Premises are completely or partially destroyed or so damaged by fire or other hazard that the Premises cannot be reasonably used by Tenant or can only be partially used by Tenant and this Lease is not terminated as above provided, there shall be no abatement of rent, it being understood and agreed that the Tenant at its discretion, cost and expense shall procure insurance necessary to protect itself against any interruption of its business. 13.02. Restoration During Last Three Years Anything in Section 13.01 to the contrary notwithstanding, if, within three (3) years prior to the expiration of the initial term or at any time during any renewal term (if any) of this Lease the Premises shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or otherwise and the estimated cost of restoration exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of the improvements constructed by Tenant on the Premises, Landlord shall be under no obligation to repair and restore the Premises, and at the election of Landlord by notice to Tenant the Lease shall terminate. 13.03. Tenant's Obligation Upon Restoration In the event of damage or destruction to the Premises and unless this Lease is terminated by Landlord or Tenant as provided in this Article 13, Tenant shall, as soon as possible, repair, redecorate and refixture the Premises and restock the contents thereof in a manner and to at least a condition equal to that existing prior to its destruction or casualty, and reopen the entire Premises for business. ARTICLE 14 Eminent Domain 14.01 Eminent Domain If the Premises, or such portion thereof as to render the balance wholly unsuitable for the purpose of Tenant, is taken by condemnation or the 26 right of eminent domain, or by agreement between Landlord and those authorized to exercise such right (collectively the &quot;condemnation proceedings&quot;), either party upon written notice to the other shall be entitled to terminate this Lease provided that such notice is given not later than thirty (30) clays after Tenant has been deprived possession of use by such taking. Should any part of the Premises be so taken and should this Lease not be terminated in accordance with the foregoing provisions, Landlord covenants and agrees promptly after such taking to expend so much as may be necessary of the net amount which may be awarded to and received by it in such condemnation proceedings in restoring the Premises to an architectural unit as nearly like its condition prior to such taking as shall in the judgment of Landlord be practicable, with an appropriate abatement to be made in Fixed Annual Minimum Rent and a corresponding reduction in Annual Minimum Gross Receipts. Should the net amount so awarded to and received by Landlord be insufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Premises as estimated by Landlord's architect, Landlord may at its election, supply the amount of such insufficiency and restore the Premises, as above provided, or terminate this Lease. Where Tenant has not already exercised any right of termination accorded to it under this Section 14.01, Landlord shall notify Tenant of Landlord's election within ninety (90) days after the final determination of the amount of the award. 14.02. Landlord Entitled to Award Out of any award for any such taking of the Premises or any part thereof, Landlord shall be entitled to receive and retain the amounts awarded for such Premises, except that Tenant shall be entitled to receive and retain only amounts which may be specially awarded to it in any such condemnation proceedings because of the taking of its trade fixtures and its leasehold improvements which have not become a part of the realty, and such business loss as Tenant shall specifically and separately establish, but not otherwise. It is understood in the event of the termination of this Lease as aforesaid, Tenant shall have no claim against the Landlord or the condemning authority for the value of any unexpired term of its Lease and no right or claim to any part of the award on account thereof. Tenant hereby waives each such claim or right and assigns any such claim or right to Landlord. ARTICLE 15 Bankruptcy and Default Provisions 15.01. Events of Default and Conditional Limitation (a) If at any time prior to or during the term any one or more of the following events occurs, each such event shall constitute an &quot;event of default&quot;: (i) Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor, if any, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (ii) Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor, if any, becomes insolvent; (iii) The leasehold estate hereby created in Tenant is taken on execution or by other process of law; 27 (iv) Any petition is filed by or against Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor, if any, in any court, whether or not pursuant to any bankruptcy, reorganization, composition extension, arrangement or insolvency proceedings, and Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor is thereafter adjudicated bankrupt, or such petition is approved by the Court, or the Court assumes jurisdiction of the subject matter and such proceedings are not dismissed within ninety (90) days after the institution of the same; or any such petition is so filed by Tenant, or Tenant's Guarantor; (v) In any proceedings, a receiver or trustee is appointed for Tenant's property or the property of Tenant's Guarantor and such receivership or trusteeship is not vacated or set aside within ninety (90) days after the appointment of such receiver or trustee; (vi) There is a transfer or an attempted transfer of this Lease or of Tenant's interest thereof in violation of the restrictions set forth in Article 17 of this Lease; (vii) Tenant ceases operation in or vacates or abandons the Premises or otherwise fails to fully perform the obligations contained in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 of this Lease; (viii) Tenant fails to comply with any local, state or federal law, rule or regulation governing the use, handling and disposal of Hazardous Materials or is otherwise in violation of the obligations contained in Section 18.03 of this Lease; (ix) Tenant fails to comply with the obligations contained in Section 21.03 of this Lease; (x) Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor, if any, fails to pay any installment of the Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent, Additional Rent or any portion of any such payment, when the same becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for ten (10) days after receipt of written notice from Landlord to Tenant; (xi) Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor, if any, fails to pay any installment of the Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent, Additional Rent or any portion of such payment, when same becomes due and payable, and such failure occurs on three (3) or more occasions in any Lease Year or Partial Lease Year; (xii) Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor, if any, fails to perform or observe any other requirement of this Lease (not hereinbefore specifically referred to) on the part of Tenant to be performed or observed and such failure continues for thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Landlord to Tenant; or (xiii) Tenant fails to comply with the obligations contained in Section 1.03 of this Lease, and such failure continues for for ten (10) days after receipt of written notice from Landlord to Tenant; or whereany such event shall occur on two or more occasions in any Lease Year or Partial Lease Year. 28 (b) This Lease and the term are expressly subject to the conditional limitation that upon the happening of any one or more of the aforementioned events of default, Landlord, in addition to the other rights and remedies it may have, shall have the right to immediately declare this Lease terminated and the term ended, in which event all of the right, title and interest of Tenant hereunder shall wholly cease and expire upon receipt by Tenant of a Notice of Termination, Tenant shall then quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord in the manner and under the conditions as provided for under this Lease, but Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided. 15.02. Landlord's Remedies (a) If this Lease shall be terminated as provided in Section 15.01, Landlord or Landlord's agents or employees may immediately or at any time thereafter re-enter the Premises and remove therefrom Tenant, its agents, employees, licensees, and any sub-tenants and other persons, firms or corporations, and all or any of its or their property therefrom, either by summary dispossess proceedings or by any suitable action or proceedings at law, in equity or by force, self-help or otherwise, without being liable to indictment or prosecution of damages therefor, and repossess and enjoy the Premises, together with all alterations, additions and improvements thereto. Landlord, in the event of such re-entry and repossession, may store Tenant's Personal Property in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of Tenant. (b) In case of any such termination, re-entry or dispossession by summary proceedings or otherwise, the rents and all other charges required to be paid up to the time of such termination, re-entry or dispossession, shall be paid by Tenant, and Tenant also shall pay to Landlord all expenses which Landlord may then or thereafter incur for legal expenses, attorneys' fees, brokerage commissions and all other costs paid or incurred by Landlord as the result of such termination, re-entry or dispossession, and for restoring the Premises to good order and condition and for altering and otherwise preparing the same for reletting and for reletting thereof. Landlord may, at any time and from time to time, relet the Premises, whole or in part, for any rental then obtainable either in its own name or as agent of Tenant, for a term which, at Landlord's option, may be for the remainder of the then current term of this Lease or for any longer or shorter period. (c) If this Lease is terminated as aforesaid, Tenant nevertheless covenants and agrees notwithstanding any entry or re-entry by Landlord whether by summary proceedings, termination or otherwise, to pay and be liable for on the days originally fixed herein for the payment thereof, amounts equal to the several installments of Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent and Additional Rent reserved as they would, under the terms of this Lease, become due if this Lease had not been terminated or if Landlord had not entered or re-entered as aforesaid, and whether the Premises is relet or remains vacant in whole or in part or for a period less than the remainder of the term, and for the whole thereof. In the event the Premises be relet by Landlord, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit (but not in excess of the Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent and Additional Rent reserved under the terms of this Lease) in the net amount of rent received by Landlord in reletting the Premises after deduction of all expenses and costs incurred or paid as aforesaid in reletting the Premises and in collecting the rent in connection therewith. At any time after the termination of the Lease, in lieu of collecting any monthly deficiencies, or any further monthly deficiencies, aforesaid, Landlord shall, at 29 Landlord's option, be entitled to recover from Tenant, in addition to any other relief, such a sum as at the time of such termination represents the amount of the then present value of the total Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent, and Additional Rent and other benefits which would have accrued to Landlord under this Lease for the remainder of the Lease term, as if the Lease had been fully complied with by Tenant, less any monthly deficiencies for such period previously paid to Landlord by Tenant. Suit or suits for the recovery of the deficiency or damages referred to in this Subsection 15.02(c) or for any installment or installments of Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent or Additional Rent hereunder, or for a sum equal to any such installment or installments, may be brought by Landlord all at once or from time to time at Landlord's election, and nothing in this Lease shall be deemed to require Landlord to await the date whereon this Lease or the term hereof would have naturally expired had there been no such default by Tenant or no such termination. (d) For the purpose of this Section 15.02, it shall be deemed that the Percentage Rent for any period after any such default and entry by Landlord would have been at the monthly rate thereafter equal to the highest Percentage Rent which Tenant was obligated to pay to Landlord under this Lease within the three (3) Lease Years (or lesser number of Lease Years since the Term Commencement Date) immediately preceding the date of such entry. (e) Tenant hereby expressly waives, so far as permitted by law, the service of any notice of intention to re-enter provided for in any statute, or of the institution of legal proceedings to that end, and Tenant for and on behalf of itself and all persons claiming through or under Tenant, also waives any and all right of redemption or re-entry or repossession under present or future laws, including any amendments hereafter, or to restore the operation of this Lease. Landlord and Tenant, so far as permitted by law, waive and will waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties hereto against the other on any matters whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, or any claim or injury or damage. The terms &quot;enter,&quot; &quot;re-enter,&quot; &quot;entry&quot; or &quot;re-entry&quot; as used in this Lease are not restricted to their technical legal meaning. In the event Landlord commences any proceedings for the recovery of possession of the Premises or to recover for non-payment of Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent or Additional Rent, Tenant shall not interpose any non-compulsory counterclaim in any such proceeding. This may not, however, be construed as a waiver of Tenant's rights to assert such claim in any separate action or actions initiated by Tenant. (f) No failure by Landlord to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, agreement, term or condition of this Lease or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, and no acceptance of full or partial rent during the continuance of any such breach shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction thus Landlord may accept any check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's rights to recover the balance due, nor shall it constitute a 30 waiver of any such breach or of such covenant, agreement, term and condition, and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach thereof. (g) In the event of any breach or threatened breach by Tenant of any of the covenants, agreements, terms or conditions contained in this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to enjoin such breach or threatened breach and shall have the right to invoke any right or remedy allowed at law or in equity, by statute or otherwise. (h) Each right and remedy of Landlord provided for in this Lease shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other right or remedy provided for in this Lease or now or hereinafter existing at law or in equity, by statute or otherwise. ARTICLE 16 Mechanics' Liens 16.01. Mechanics' Liens (a) If any mechanics' liens are filed against the Premises or any portion of the Shopping Center based upon any act of Tenant or anyone claiming through Tenant, Tenant shall hold Landlord harmless from all damages, claims and expenses arising therefrom, and Tenant, after notice from Landlord (or any person in privity of estate with Landlord), shall forthwith within fifteen (15) days, commence indemnification by the performance of said obligation by interposing a fund by way of bond, deposit payment or otherwise sufficiently satisfy such lien without resort or recourse against the Premises. In the event Tenant does not remove or satisfy said lien within said fifteen (15) day period, Landlord shall have the right to do so by posting a bond or undertaking, and Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord for any and all expenses incurred by Landlord in connection therewith five (5) days after receipt by Tenant of Landlord's invoice therefor. These expenses shall include, but not be limited to, filing fees, legal fees and bond premiums. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to in any way abrogate Tenant's right to contest the efficacy of any mechanic's lien filed against the Premises based on the acts or omissions of Tenant. (b) Nothing in this Article 16 shall be deemed or construed as (i) Landlord's consent to any person, firm or corporation for the performance of any work or services or the supply of any materials to the Premises or any improvement thereon, or (ii) giving Tenant of any other person, firm or corporation any right to contract for or to perform or supply any work, services or materials that would permit or give rise to a lien against the Premises or any part thereof. 31 ARTICLE 17 Assignments, Subleases and Other Transfers of Tenant's Interest 17.01. Limitations on Tenant's Rights (a) Neither this Lease nor the interest of Tenant in this Lease shall be sold, assigned, transferred, mortgaged, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, whether by operation of law or otherwise, nor shall the Premises or any part thereof be sublet or subject to any license or concession without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance. The sale or transfer of stock constituting a controlling interest in Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor shall be considered for the purpose of this Lease to be an assignment, and likewise shall require Landlord's prior written consent, except where Tenant or Tenant's Guarantor is a corporation having its shares traded on the New York, American or Over-The-Counter stock exchange or market. Tenant shall make available to Landlord the stock record books of Tenant and Tenant's Guarantor and shall produce the same on request of Landlord. Similarly, if Tenant is a partnership, the interest of any partner shall not be transferred without Landlord's prior written consent. For the purposes of this Lease, the entering into of any management agreement or any similar agreement which transfers control of the business operations of Tenant in the Premises shall be treated as an assignment of this Lease and shall require Landlord's prior written consent. Any attempted transfer, assignment, subletting, license or concession agreement, hypothecation or other transfer herein that is prohibited without Landlord's prior written consent shall be void and confer no rights upon any third party. (b) No permitted assignment made shall be effective until there are delivered to Landlord (i) an agreement, in recordable form, executed by Tenant and the proposed assignee, wherein such assignee assumes due performance of the obligations of Tenant's part to be performed under this Lease to the end of the term hereof and (ii) a written consent to such assignment by the holder of any fee or leasehold mortgage affecting the Premises to which this Lease is then subject and such consent shall have been obtained and delivered to Landlord if so required by the terms of such mortgage or by a collateral document securing the same obligations as are secured by such mortgage. (c) Any assignment of this Lease or any sublease affecting the Premises or any other permitted transfer hereunder shall be subject and subordinate to the full terms and conditions of this Lease. Regardless of either the assumption by any assignee or sublessee of due performance or the Landlord's acceptance of rent or other charges from such assignee or sublessee, Tenant shall not be released by any assignment or sublease but shall continue to be fully responsible for the due performance of Tenant's obligations hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as if no such assignment or sublease had been made. 17.02 Effect of Landlord's Consent (a) Any consent by Landlord to a sale, assignment, sublease, mortgage, pledge, license, concession, hypothecation, or transfer of this Lease, shall apply only to the specific transaction thereby authorized and shall not 32 relieve Tenant from the requirement of obtaining prior written consent of Landlord to any further sale, assignment, sublease, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, or transfer of this Lease. When the consent of Landlord is required hereunder to any proposed assignment or sublease of this Lease, or to the mortgaging, pledging, licensing, concession or hypothecation of this Lease, contemporaneously with the request of Tenant therefor, Tenant shall submit in writing information reasonably sufficient to enable Landlord to make a decision with respect thereto. (b) With respect to any of the consents requested by Tenant, whether or not the Landlord has consented thereto, Tenant shall pay to the Landlord all reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and all other expenses incurred by the Landlord in connection therewith. ARTICLE 18 Compliance with Government Orders 18.01. Tenant to Comply Tenant, at its own expense, shall promptly execute and comply with all statutes, ordinances, rules, orders, regulations and requirements of the federal, state and local governments and of any and all other departments and bureaus applicable to the Premises or to the business conducted by Tenant at the Premises, whether ordinary, extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen (&quot;Governmental Orders&quot;). In addition, Tenant, at its own expense, shall comply promptly with and execute all rules, orders, regulations and recommendations of the Board of Fire Underwriters, Rating Board and Landlord and Tenant's insurance companies with respect to the prevention of fires and the exposure of liability risks (&quot;Insurance Matters&quot;). Tenant, at its own expense, shall furnish and maintain in good order an adequate number and type of fire extinguishers on the Premises at all times. 18.02. Failure to Comply In case Tenant fails or neglects to comply with any of the Government Orders, Insurance Matters or the ADA (as hereinafter defined) as herein required of Tenant, then Landlord or its agent may enter the Premises and make said repairs and comply with any and all of the Government Orders, Insurance Matters or the ADA at the cost and expense of Tenant, and in case Tenant fails to pay therefor upon notice within five (5) days thereafter, the said cost and expenses, including eighteen percent (18%) for administration costs, shall be added to the next month's installment of Fixed Annual Minimum Rent and be due and payable as such or Landlord may deduct the same from any balance remaining in Landlord's hands. This provision is in addition to the right of Landlord to terminate this Lease by reason of default on the part of Tenant. 18.03. Hazardous Material Tenant shall, at all times, comply with all local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations governing the use, handling and disposal of Hazardous Material in the Premises including, but not limited to Section 1004 of 33 the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq. (42 U.S.C. Section 6903) and any additions, amendments, or modifications thereto. As used herein, the term &quot;Hazardous Material&quot; shall mean any hazardous or toxic substance, material or waste which is, or becomes, regulated by any local or state government authority in which the Premises is located or the United States Government. Landlord and its agents shall have the right, but not the duty, to inspect the Premises at any time to determine whether Tenant is complying with the terms of this Section. If Tenant is not in compliance with this Section, Landlord shall have the right to immediately enter upon the Premises and take whatever actions reasonably necessary to comply including, but not limited to, the removal from the Premises of any Hazardous Material and the restoration of the Premises to a clean, neat, attractive, healthy and sanitary condition. Tenant shall pay all such costs incurred by Landlord ten (10) days upon receipt of a bill therefor plus eighteen percent (18%) for administration. The covenants in this Section 18.03 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 18.04. Americans With Disabilities Act Tenant, at its own expense, shall at all times comply with and shall cause the Premises to be in compliance with the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and any additions, amendments or modifications thereto and all related regulations (the &quot;ADA&quot;). ARTICLE 19 Subordination, Mortgagee's Rights and Assignment of Rents 19.01 Subordination The rights and interests of Tenant under this Lease shall be subject and subordinate to any ground lease, mortgage or trust deed now or hereafter placed upon any portion of the Shopping Center, and to any advances made thereunder, and to the interest thereon, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements, extensions and re-financings thereof. Tenant agrees that any ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee may elect to give the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease priority over the lien of its ground lease, mortgage or trust deed. In the event of such election, the rights and interest of Tenant under this Lease automatically shall have priority in whole or in part, over the lien of said ground lease, mortgage or trust deed, and no additional consent or instrument shall be necessary or required. However, Tenant agrees to execute and deliver the Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement attached as Exhibit F, and any other instruments that may be requested by any ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee for such purposes, and in the event Tenant fails to do so within ten (10) days after demand in writing, Tenant does hereby make, constitute and irrevocably appoint Landlord as its attorney-in-fact (which shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest) and in its name, place and stead so to do. 19.02. Mortgagee's Rights (a) So long as any such ground lease, trust deed or mortgage remains a lien on any portion of the Shopping Center, Tenant agrees, 34 simultaneously with the giving of any notice to Landlord which is required to be given by this Lease, to give a duplicate copy thereof to the respective ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee. Landlord agrees to notify Tenant of any ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee to whom such notice must be sent. Further, Tenant agrees that if Landlord defaults in its performance of any of the covenants under this Lease and if such default entitles Tenant to terminate this Lease, the ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee may cure said default within a reasonable period of time beyond any time period required of Landlord (but in any event not less than an additional fifteen (15) business days), and, if necessary, be permitted entry upon the Premises for the purpose of curing any such default. The giving of any such notice to Landlord shall not be properly given under the terms of this Lease and shall be of no force and effect until a duplicate copy thereof is also given to the ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee pursuant to this Section 19.02. (b) The parties hereto mutually agree that so long as any ground lease, mortgage or trust deed is a lien upon the Premises, they will not reduce the rents below that provided for in this Lease, provide for payments of rent prior to the time herein provided for, nor terminate this Lease prior to the end of the term, except as otherwise provided in this Lease, without first obtaining the written consent of the ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee, and that any such proposed modification or termination without the written consent of said ground lessor, mortgagee or trustee shall be void as against said ground lessor, mortgagee, or trustee. 19.03. Assignment of Rents (a) With reference to any assignment by Landlord of Landlord's interest in this Lease, or the rents payable hereunder, conditional in nature or otherwise, which assignment is made to the holder of a mortgage or ground lease on property which includes the Premises, Tenant agrees: (i) that the execution thereof by Landlord, and the acceptance thereof by the holder of such mortgage or the ground lessor, shall never be treated as an assumption by such holder or ground lessor any of the obligations of Landlord hereunder, unless such holder or ground lessor shall, by notice sent to Tenant, specifically otherwise elect; and (ii) that except as aforesaid, such holder or ground lessor shall be treated as having assumed Landlord's obligations hereunder with respect only to those obligations that arise following a foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof, or assumption of Landlord's position by a ground lessor only upon foreclosure of such holder's mortgage and the taking of possession of the Premises, or, in the case of a ground lessor, the assumption of Landlord's position hereunder by such ground lessor. Tenant agrees that with respect to those obligations of Landlord that arise prior to a foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof, or assumption of Landlord's position by a ground lessor, such foreclosing mortgagee in possession or ground lessor shall have no liability. (b) Where a party acquires Landlord's interest in property (whether land only, or land and buildings) which includes the Premises, and simultaneously leases the same back, such acquisition shall not be treated as an assumption of Landlord's position hereunder, and this Lease shall thereafter be subject and subordinate at all times to such lease. 35 ARTICLE 20 Entry to Premises 20.01. Entry to Premises by Landlord Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises at all reasonable times, with reasonable notice for the purposes of: (i) inspecting the same, (ii) making any repairs to the Premises and performing any work therein that may be necessary or desirable, (iii) exhibiting the Premises for the purpose of sale, ground lease, mortgage or other financing, (iv) exhibiting the Premises (within one year prior to the expiration of the term of this Lease) to prospective tenants. Nothing in this Lease shall imply any duty on the part of Landlord to do work or perform obligations which, under any of the provisions of this Lease, Tenant may be required to perform, and the performance thereof by Landlord shall not constitute a constructive eviction nor a waiver of Tenant's default. ARTICLE 21 Notices and Certificates 21.01 Notices (a) Any notice, statement, certificate, request or demand required or permitted to be given or delivered in this Lease shall be in writing, and sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested and addressed to Landlord (or any other entitled notice party under the terms of this Lease) at the address shown at the beginning of this Lease, and to Tenant at the address shown at the beginning of this Lease, or to such other addresses as Landlord or Tenant shall designate in the manner herein provided. Landlord's managing agent, and, as provided in this Lease, the designated agent of Mortgagee, is hereby authorized and designated to give or deliver to Tenant any notice under this Lease. Any such notice, statement, certificate, request or demand shall, in the case of registered or certified mailing, be deemed to have been given on the date mailed as aforesaid in any post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government, except in case for notice of change of address or revocation of a prior notice, which shall only be effective upon receipt. (b) At any time or times when Tenant's interest herein is vested in more than one person, firm or corporation, jointly, in common or in severalty, a notice given by Landlord to any one such person, firm or 36 corporation shall be conclusively deemed to have been given to all such persons, firms or corporations. Any notices by Tenant pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be void and ineffective unless signed by all such persons, firms and corporations, unless all such persons, firms and corporations have previously given notice to Landlord, signed by each of them and designating and authorizing one or more of them to give the notice referred to, and such notice shall then be unrevoked by any notice to Landlord. 21.02. Estoppel Certificate of Landlord Within ten (10) days after request by Tenant, Landlord, from time to time and without charge, shall deliver to Tenant or to a person, firm or corporation specified by Tenant, a duly executed and acknowledged instrument certifying: (i) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect, or if there has been any modification, that the same is in full force and effect as modified, and identifying the date of any such modification; and (ii) whether Landlord knows or does not know, as the case may be, of any default by tenant in the performance by tenant of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, and specifying the nature of such defaults, if any. Such certification shall not stop Landlord from thereafter asserting any existing default of which Landlord did not have actual knowledge on the date of execution thereof. 21.03. Estoppel Certificate of Tenant Within ten (10) days after request by Landlord or Landlord's ground lessor or mortgagee, Tenant, from time to time and without charge, shall deliver to Landlord or the requesting party, or to a person, firm or corporation, specified by Landlord, a duly executed and acknowledged instrument, in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto. Such certification shall not estop Tenant from thereafter asserting any existing default of which Tenant did not have actual knowledge on the date of execution thereof. ARTICLE 22 Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment 22.01. Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (a) Tenant, subject to the terms and provisions of this Lease and on payment of the rent and observing, keeping and performing all of the terms and provisions of this Lease on its part to be observed, kept and performed, shall lawfully, peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises during the term hereof on and after the Term Commencement Date without hindrance or ejection by any persons lawfully claiming under Landlord; but it is understood and agreed that this covenant, and any and all other covenants of Landlord contained in this Lease shall be binding upon Landlord and its successors only 37 with respect to breaches occurring during its and their respective ownership of Landlord's interest hereunder. If Landlord is unable to place Tenant in possession of the Premises at the Term Commencement Date by reason of the possession of the Premises by another tenant holding over under a lease, such inability by Landlord shall not constitute a default under this Lease; but the Term Commencement Date shall be postponed until such date as such holdover tenant gives up possession of the Premises and the term of this Lease shall be deemed to commence on such Term Commencement Date as postponed. (b) With respect to any services to be furnished by Landlord to Tenant, Landlord shall in no event be liable for failure to furnish the same when prevented from doing so by strike, lockout, breakdown, accident, order or regulation of or by any governmental authority, or failure of supply, or inability by the exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain supplies, parts or employees necessary to furnish such services, or because of war or other emergency, or for any cause beyond Landlord's control. In no event shall Landlord ever be liable to Tenant for any indirect or consequential damages by reason of Landlord's breach or default of the terms of this Lease. ARTICLE 23 Miscellaneous Provisions 23.01 Holdover (a) It is expressly understood by Tenant that Tenant's right to possession of the Premises under this Lease shall terminate at the expiration or earlier termination of the term, and should Tenant continue thereafter to remain in possession, Landlord, should it so elect, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of law with respect to summary recovery of possession from a holdover tenant. Tenant shall indemnify and save harmless Landlord from any claim, damage, expense, cost or loss which Landlord may incur by reason of such holding over, including without limitation, any claim of a succeeding tenant, or any loss by Landlord with respect to a lost opportunity to re-let the Premises. (b) Should Tenant continue to occupy the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the term with the consent of the Landlord, such tenancy shall be from month-to-month, and such month-to-month tenancy shall be under the same terms, covenants and conditions as set forth in this Lease, except that Tenant shall pay Fixed Annual Minimum Rent on the basis of either (i) Fixed Annual Minimum Rent in effect for the last year of the term multiplied by the percentage (which shall in no event be less than 100%) found by dividing the Index for the first calendar month of such month-to-month tenancy by the Index for the calendar month in which the Term Commencement Date falls, or (ii) three (3) times the Fixed Annual Minimum Rent for the last year of the term, whichever is greater. 23.02. Limitation on Landlord's Personal Liability (a) It is understood and agreed that Tenant shall look solely to the estate and property of Landlord in the Shopping Center for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies for the collection of a judgment (or other judicial 38 process) requiring the payment of money by Landlord in the event of any default or breach by Landlord with respect to any of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease to be observed or performed by the Landlord, and any other obligation of Landlord created by or under this Lease, and no other property or assets of Landlord or of its partners, beneficiaries, co-tenants, shareholders, members, or principals (as the case may be) shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedures for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies. In no event shall Tenant name Landlord's partners, members, beneficiaries, co-tenants, shareholders or principals to any suit or other proceeding to which Tenant and/or Landlord are a party arising out of or relating to this Lease, unless the naming of such partners, members, beneficiaries, co-tenants, shareholders or principals is required in order to permit the Tenant to obtain jurisdiction over Landlord herein. (b) The term &quot;Landlord,&quot; as used in Subsection 23.02(a) and throughout this Lease, shall be limited to mean and include only the owner or owners at the time in question of Landlord's interest in this Lease. Further, in the event of any transfer by Landlord of Landlord's interest in this Lease, Landlord herein named (and in case of any subsequent transfers or conveyances, the then assignor), including each of its partners, beneficiaries, co-tenants, shareholders, members, or principals (as the case may be), shall be automatically freed and relieved, from and after the date of such transfer or conveyance, of all liability for the performance of any covenants and agreements on the part of Landlord. 23.03. Definition of Tenant's Allocable Share (a) Intentionally deleted. The term &quot;Tenant's Allocable Share&quot; shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of square feet of the premises as set forth in Section 1.01, and the denominator of which is ninety five percent (95%) of the total number of square feet of Total Tenant Area (defined in Section 23.03(c)) of the Shopping Center.

Square feet shall not include the surface area of any roof structures used for mechanical equipment. 23.04 Force Majeure The period of time during which either party is prevented or delayed in any performance or the making of any improvements or repairs or fulfilling any obligation under this Lease, other than the payment of Fixed Annual Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent and Additional Rent, due to unavoidable delays caused by fire, catastrophe, strikes or labor trouble, civil commotion, Acts of God, the 39 public enemy, governmental prohibitions or regulations or inability to obtain materials by reason thereof, or any other causes beyond such party's reasonable control, shall be added to such party's time for performance, and such party shall have no liability by reason of such delay, except that as a condition to Tenant's right to avail itself of Force Majeure, Tenant must give Landlord written notice of such claimed Force Majeure not later than three (3) business days following the occurrence of such Force Majeure. 23.05 Relocation of Tenant Landlord shall have the right to relocate Tenant within the cross-hatched area shown on Exhibit A-2 attached hereto and made a part hereof upon thirty (30) days' notice to Tenant, at Landlord's cost and expense, which relocation shall in no way affect the obligation or duties of either party hereunder. In the event Tenant shall fail or refuse to accept the new location within ten (10) days of such notice, Landlord at its option, may terminate this Lease upon fifteen (15) days' notice to Tenant.

Tenant shall then make all rent payments thereafter directly to such lessor. In the event any proceedings are brought for the foreclosure of, or in the event of conveyance by deed in lieu of foreclosure of, or in the event of the exercise of the power of sale under, any mortgage or deed of trust made by Landlord covering the Premises, or in the event Landlord sells, conveys or otherwise transfers its interest in the Shopping Center or any portion thereof containing the Premises, Tenant shall attorn to and hereby covenants and agrees to execute an instrument in writing reasonably satisfactory to the new owner whereby Tenant attorns to such successor in interest and recognizes such successor as the Landlord under this Lease. 23.08.

Landlord also reserves the right to modify Tenant's design and material election for the Storefront. c. Storefront Design Guidelines It is the intent of these guidelines to encourage the design of Storefronts which reinforce the concept of the mall as a streetscape. The streetscape is comprised of tenants' Storefronts which have varying shapes, sizes and materials and which also vary in the degree to which they project beyond or are recessed from the bulkhead line. Creativity in the streetscape theme and the use of new and innovative materials is highly encouraged by Landlord; our Design Department is available and willing to assist tenants in creating a noteworthy and exciting design. Landlord's review of Tenant's Design Drawings is for design purposes only. Tenant's architect and/or engineer accepts all responsibility for any non-compliance with federal, state or local codes, ordinances, rules or regulations applicable to Tenant's Premises. d. Storefront 'Pop-Out' Criteria The following sets forth the required criteria for allowable Storefront projections: PLEASE NOTE: Refer to the Dimension Control Plan for the &quot;Condition&quot; which pertains to the 'pop-out' criteria listed below. Tenant may occupy an enclosed projected area beyond the bulkhead line containing up to sixty percent (60%) of the area bounded by the maximum Storefront projection line, the bulkhead line, and the &quot;no build zone&quot; (as defined below), while respecting other setback lines as conditions apply (see Dimension Control Plan). 7 A &quot;no build zone&quot; of either 1'-6&quot; or 1-0&quot; is required between tenants' Storefronts. See Tenant Design Handbook for details. Overhead projections (minimum 8'-0&quot; A.F.F.) may be constructed anywhere within the area bounded by the maximum Storefront projection line, the &quot;no build zone&quot; and other setback lines as conditions apply (subject to Landlord's approval) (see Dimension Control Plan). The Storefront will or may be built to a height no higher than the bottom of Landlord's bulkhead and shall not project outside the maximum Storefront projection line as shown on the Dimension Control Plan. At all mall Storefront feature columns, any partition of Tenant's storefront which must attach to Landlord's feature column must be full height glass. This glass must intersect at the center line of the feature column and run parallel to Landlord's mall bulkhead for a minimum of 12 inches from the face of the feature column before changing direction. At all Storefront(s), illuminated signs mounted to the outside of the Storefront will not extend below 8'-0&quot; A.F.F. Tenant must appropriately finish the top portion of its projected Storefront with a finish of the same quality and material as that used on the vertical surfaces of Tenant's projected Storefront. Particular Storefront conditions require reference to Tenant's Dimension Control Plan for the location(s) of any column(s) for the purpose of respecting the 12'-6&quot; radius setback of Tenant's &quot;pop-out.&quot; In no case will there be a limit on the amount of storefront which may be recessed behind the bulkhead line. e. Characteristics and Materials No artificial images such as applied roofs, dormers, thatch, veneer brick, veneer field stone, pegboard, cork products, carpet, painted gypsum wallboard, vinyl, plastic or metal laminate, nor zolatone will be permitted in the construction of Tenant's Storefront.
