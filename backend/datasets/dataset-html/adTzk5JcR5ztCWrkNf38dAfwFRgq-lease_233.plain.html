(ii) Upgrade Option: Upgrade Option: Lessee may upgrade the Equipment beginning at the end of the first six (6) month period of the Term and at the end of each six month (6) period of the Term thereafter based upon the following conditions: (i) Lessee shall have the right to replace or upgrade up to an aggregate amount of 40% of the units of the Equipment during the Term (the &quot;Upgrade Option&quot;) with new or used slot machines acceptable to Lessor (the &quot;Replacement Equipment&quot;); (ii) Lessee shall obtain the Replacement Equipment exclusively through Lessor on a unit for unit trade out basis at the normal and customary margin of 30% on used equipment or the manufacturer's retail list price for new equipment; (iii) Lessee must notify Lessor that it intends to exercise its rights pursuant to the Upgrade Option and to notify Lessor of the percentage of the units of Equipment Lessee desires to replace with Replacement Equipment at least thirty days prior the end of each six month (6) period ; (iv) Lessee may only exercise one Upgrade Option during any six (6) month period and for no more than 10% of the units at any one time; (v) Lessee is not in default (see Section 19 of the Master Lease Agreement) under the Lease; (vi) there are no material adverse changes to Lessee's condition (financial, business or otherwise); (vii) Lessee agrees to lease the Replacement Equipment from Lessor under a new Equipment lease schedule reflecting terms and rental factors consistent with terms generally available from Lessor at that time; (viii) Lessee agrees to have all of the Replacement Equipment in service within thirty (30) days following the end of each six (6) month period for which an Upgrade Option is exercised; and (ix) Lessee delivers the returned Equipment to Lessor in like similar condition as originally leased, normal wear and tear excepted. Upon receipt of the returned Equipment and execution of the appropriate documents, including, but not limited to, the new Equipment lease schedule for the Replacement Equipment for a term of thirty-six (36) months, evidencing the obligation of the Lessee to lease the Replacement Equipment, Lessor shall amend this Lease Schedule to reflect the exercise of the Upgrade Option, credit Lessee with the then retail value of the units of Equipment returned to Lessor, with the retail value being determined using two equipment quotes (one obtained by Lessee and one obtained by Lessor) and the quotes will be based upon the value of the same or similar equipment of the same age and character being used in the state of Florida, if any, and if none, then being used in the state of Nevada, and reduce the Basic Rent due under this Lease Schedule to reflect the credit for the returned equipment. (iii) Renewal Option: At the expiration of the Term, if Lessee is not in default of the Lease or this Lease Schedule and has not had a materially adverse change in its financial condition since the Commencement Date, Lessee may renew the Lease Term for a period of four (4) to twelve (12) months (&quot;Renewal Term&quot;) at the then fair market rental as determined by Lessor in its sole discretion, based upon the Exercise Price and a rate mutually acceptable to Lessor and Lessee (the &quot;Renewal Option&quot;).

Unless otherwise specified above, Lessee must give written notice of the exercise of any option 120 days prior to the expiration of a term. If written notice of exercise of any Purchase Option or Renewal Option is not received within a notification period as specified herein, the applicable term shall be automatically renewed for an additional 120 days at the most recent Basic Rent as set forth under the Lease Schedule (the &quot;Automatic Renewal Term&quot;). Upon timely receipt of such notice of exercise, receipt of the payment of all Rent due under the Lease and payment of the Exercise Price, Lessor will, with exercise of the Purchase Option, execute and deliver to Lessee a Bill of Sale for the Equipment described in the Lease Schedule. Upon failure of the Lessor to so deliver a Bill of Sale, this Option shall then constitute a conveyance of the Equipment in accordance herewith and Lessee is hereby appointed attorney-in-fact of Lessor to execute and deliver all instruments necessary to convey title to Lessee in accordance herewith, which power of attorney is coupled with an interest and irrevocable.

Lessee shall in all respects remain obligated under the Lease for payment of Rent, care, maintenance, delivery, use and insurance of the Equipment until Lessor inspects and accepts the Equipment, which inspection and acceptance shall be undertaken promptly and in good faith. In the event it shall at any time be determined that by reason of the options hereby given or otherwise that the lease of the Equipment to which the Purchase Option or the Renewal Option applies was in fact a sale to the Lessee of the Equipment, the Lessee agrees that neither it nor its successors or assigns has or will have any claim or cause of action against Lessor, its successors or assigns, for any reason for loss sustained by virtue of such determination. c.

There are no other warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
