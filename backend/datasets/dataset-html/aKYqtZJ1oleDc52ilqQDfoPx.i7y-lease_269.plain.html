          <p id="s1p448">Whilst every care has been taken in completing our survey and report, the investigations have been non­ destructive in nature and therefore we are unable to report upon matters that are concealed at the time of the inspection, and the following assumptions have had to be made:</p>
          <p id="s1p449">That high alumna cement (HAC), concrete or calcium chloride additive or other deleterious materials or techniques were not used when the original property or any subsequent additions were built.</p>
          <p id="s1p450">That any wall ties that exist are not perished.</p>

          <p id="s1p453">We have not inspected woodwork or other parts of the structure which are not uncovered, unexposed or are inaccessible and we are therefore unable to report that the property is free from defect; however, we have done our best to draw conclusions about the construction from surface evidence visible at the time of our inspection.We have not inspected the wall cavities or wall ties. It was not possible to fully examine the floors in areas which were tiled. Corners of carpets were lifted where possible and isolated areas examined. No pressure smoke or other tests have been applied to the drains.</p>

          <p id="s1p462">The Property in General:</p>
          <p id="s1p463">The property is situated in the IDA Business and Technology Park between the Monivea Road and the Tuam Road.Unit-19, this building, was constructed in the late 1960's and early 1970's as part of a series of starter industrial units.It is the last in a series of nine similar units which have housed companies such as Digital, Nortel and Avaya. Abbott Vascular Ireland were the most recent tenants of this building. They carried out extensive refurbishment throughout installing clean rooms, gowning rooms, canteen and other ancillary facilities. There is a small landscaped bed along the width of the building in front of which there are eight dedicated parking spaces. The dedicated parking and drop-off zone to the rear of the building has been cordoned off with galvanized steel fencing.</p>
          <p id="s1p464">The overall area of the building and yards is roughly 1,800m2 [19,370sq.ft].</p>
          <p id="s1p465">The site itself and surrounding lands are level. The front of the building faces north east.</p>

          <p id="s1p489">●</p>
          <p id="s1p490">Main Roof &amp; the Front-Offices Flat Roof The externalflat roofs and pitched sections of the northlights are finished in Trocal or a similar high-performance membrane and appear to have been Installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The Trocal is laid on an · isolating membrane on high density insulation on a profiled metal deck.Structurally, the roof is formed with steel lattice girders which crank up at 45° in the northlights and together with the flat sections provide a self-supporting clear span of22.45m (73'7&quot;} at roughly 5.0m (16'5&quot;) above finished floor level. The lower level flat roof deck to the front of the building is supported on steel joists spanning from the front band beam to the corridor wall.</p>
          <p id="s1p491">●</p>
          <p id="s1p492">Main Roof Northlights:The northlights to the main roof are pitched at 45°. They are Georgian­ wire aluminium-framed single-glazed units 21.4m wide by 1.8m high. Upstands and flashings appear to be in order and there's no apparent evidence of water ingress.</p>
          <p id="s1p493">●</p>
          <p id="s1p494">Front Offices Flat Roof Rooflights:This external flat roof has a series of Georgian-wire aluminium-framed glazed rooflights installed over the toilet block area.Upstands and flashings appear to be in order and there's no apparent evidence of water ingress at present. However, the suspended ceiling tiles beneath do have signs of staining due to roof leaks in this area at some stage.</p>
          <p id="s1p495">●</p>
          <p id="s1p496">Pitched Roof to Shipping Area:This roof is a single-skin profiled metaldeck with similar fascia and barge detailing. It sits on a steel mono-pitch frame with purlins and joists supports. There is a lining of thin reflective insulated material fixed to the soffite over this area. Possibly to prevent condensation. This yard area is open to the elements at one side and there are swallows nesting in the roof space.</p>

          <p id="s1p503">●</p>
          <p id="s1p504">&quot;Condition: The roofs in general have been well maintained and although there are many penetrations for services there was no evidence of water ingress on the day of the survey. Galway has recently experienced a prolonged period of rainfall. There is some evidence of ponding on the flat roof sections but the ramwater outlets appear to be free from blockages and debris.The fall to the roof surfaces may not be adequate to disperse the water. There are patches of paint coming off the soffit (underside) for the metal decking.This roof construction would not meet with current Building Regulation standards. However, the air and atmosphere within the building was reasonably pleasant and there was no sign of musty smells associated with damp conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p505">2.</p>
          <p id="s1p506">Walls:</p>
          <p id="s1p507">●</p>
          <p id="s1p508">External Walls:External masonry walls are finished in concrete brickwork.There is a plastered 450 x 450 reinforced concrete band beam above window level along the front elevation. This is capped with profiled steel flashing and laid over the roofing membrane. The band beam is supported by 230 x 230 reinforced concrete columns at 3.8m crs.</p>
          <p id="s1p509">●</p>
          <p id="s1p510">Beneath the beam there are large sections of double-glazed aluminium framed windows which sit on the concrete floor slab. The lower sections of these windows are filled with lightweight Insulated panels which are painted. Other external walls to the rear and one side are either concrete brickwork or rendered concrete blockwork.The rear walls have been patched up in places where there were service ducts penetrating.</p>
          <p id="s1p511">●</p>
          <p id="s1p512">Condition: This type of construction would no longer be acceptable as it doesn't comply with the Building Regulations.Structurally however, there was no evidence of subsidence or cracking in any of these elements. I checked the reveals with a moisture meter and results were negative. There are no signs of tidemarks or rising damp in the structure.</p>
          <p id="s1p513">●</p>
          <p id="s1p514">Internal Walls:The compartment walls separating this unit from the adjoining buildings are constructed of220mm fairfaced blockwork with 300 x 230 reinforced concrete columns at 7.62m crs.These walls for the most part have been lined with modular steel panels similar to those in the clean rooms.The dry-linings to the front office area, which has been kitted out as a canteen are dry-lined with plasterboard and skimmed. There are still some fairfaced block surfaces evident throughout the building; at the entrance and on the corridor to the toilet facilities and in the receiving area. Most of the other Internal walls to the structure I.e. clean rooms, ancillary areas and circulation corridors are constructed with 1160mm wide modular, insulated demountable steel-panels. They are roughly 80mm thick, fire-rated, with their own dedicated windows and doors.The panels are finished in polyester powder-coated galvanized steel plate coloured &quot;Iceberg white• (near RAL 9010) and manufactured by &quot;Dagard&quot;.</p>
          <p id="s1p515">●</p>
          <p id="s1p516">Condition:The walls and ceilings to the clean rooms have been installed to a high standard to meet with the necessary regulations for this purpose:Class 100,000.The fairfaced masonry to the corridors and receiving area can be easily dry-lined if necessary. This would involve moving some of the electricaland mechanical boards. Structurally, there is no evidence of subsidence or cracking in any of these elements and walls tested plumb with a spirit level throughout.</p>
          <p id="s1p517">3.</p>
          <p id="s1p518">Floors:</p>
          <p id="s1p519">●</p>
          <p id="s1p520">The floor is constructed in 300mm thick reinforced concrete. It is laid In bays with expansion joints between each bay.With the exception of the warehouse, the floors throughout are finished in Mipolam 500 Esprit 5001 &quot;Ice Crystal&quot; with matching caved skirtings. The floor to the warehouse is painted in an epoxy resin.</p>
          <p id="s1p521">●</p>
          <p id="s1p522">Condition: The floors are generally in good condition. The resin coating In the warehouse Is showing signs of wear from heavy trafficking and cracking along the expansion joints. Otherwise, there is no evidence of subsidence or structural cracking.</p>
          <p id="s1p523">4.</p>
          <p id="s1p524">Ceilings:</p>
          <p id="s1p525">●</p>
          <p id="s1p526">The ceiling grid in the clean rooms and ancillary areas is 1200 x 600 with washable moisture­ proof tiles manufactured by Biogard. The tiles, light units, air-conditioning diffusers and grid are all bonded together to form an impermeable surface.</p>
          <p id="s1p527">●</p>
          <p id="s1p528">The new ceiling grid in the canteen is 600 x 600 with standard acoustic tiles.</p>

          <p id="s1p544">Components:</p>
          <p id="s1p545">●</p>
          <p id="s1p546">Windows and Doors to Front Elevation: These are constructed in aluminium frame, double­ glazed with a void of less than 9mm. They are very poor quality and should be replaced with modern fenestration. This would address heat loss Issues, security problems and would also be more visually attractive</p>
          <p id="s1p547">●</p>
          <p id="s1p548">Emergency Exits: The timber emergency exit doors are in reasonable condition but could do with being sanded and repainted.</p>
          <p id="s1p549">●</p>
          <p id="s1p550">Roller-Shutter Doors: The old externalroller-shutter door to the delivery bay was locked shut on the day of inspection so therefore I cannot comment on its operation except to say I was informed that It works properly. The sectional roller door to the warehouse is a recent installation and is working satisfactorily.</p>
          <p id="s1p551">●</p>
          <p id="s1p552">Service Compartments: The timber doors to the service cornpartments are in reasonable condition.These are all painted blue with identifying signage to each one. Ironmongery is in satisfactory condition.</p>
          <p id="s1p553">●</p>
          <p id="s1p554">The doors to the toilet facilities are timber semi-solid core doors. They are of poorOther Doors:quality. Note: The door to the disabled WC and lobby does not meet the current Building Regulation standard width necessary for wheelchair access. Ideally this door should be directly on to a corridor and not through a lobby.</p>

          <p id="s1p556">Plumbing:</p>
          <p id="s1p557">●</p>
          <p id="s1p558">Plumbing in general:Plumbing looks to have been recently overhauled and in general appears satisfactory. This should however be thoroughly checked by a qualified certified plumber.</p>

          <p id="s1p570">Sprinkler:</p>
          <p id="s1p571">●</p>
          <p id="s1p572">There is a sprinkler system in this building.It is no longer in use and has been disconnected from the water supply. There are fire hydrants to the front and rear of the building in the event of an emergency.</p>
          <p id="s1p573">11.</p>
          <p id="s1p574">Drainage:</p>
          <p id="s1p575">●</p>
          <p id="s1p576">Surface Water: The rainwater outlets to all the roof areas are in satisfactory condition.There is a surface water drain running from the warehouse to the front of the building. It is accessible via sealed manholes in the concrete floor. Some of these are covered over in the clean rooms etc.The road gulley along the width of the property at the rear is completely blocked but there Is no sign of ponding.</p>
          <p id="s1p577">●</p>
          <p id="s1p578">Foul Sewer: There are three internal sealed manholes in the main corridor just outside the toilet facilities. There was no evidence of foul smells and the soil vent pipes are satisfactory.</p>
          <p id="s1p579">●</p>
          <p id="s1p580">I did not attempt to lift any of the manholes as this would involve breaking the seals. As there was no evidence of foul smells in the vicinity I would be confident that this aspect of the building is currently in satisfactory condition. Discharge from the new sanitary appliances in the gowning rooms is pumped from sumps via an overhead route to the external drainage.</p>

          <p id="s1p594">The landscaped bed to the front of the building is in poor condition and in need of serious maintenance. I would advise that this feature be removed completely and replaced with something new and fresh to enhance the building's appearance.</p>
          <p id="s1p595">Conclusions: Even though this building is roughly 40 years old it has been reasonably well maintained. It currently has a Building Energy Rating (BER) of D1 which is remarkable for its age and type of construction. The recent upgrades to the property are of a high standard and the roof finishes are far superior to those of the adjoining units.</p>
