The guarantor must pay the landlord the amount of the loss resulting from the unenforceability.</p>

          <p id="s1p353">16.1 Unless the Act applies, if the words “The mediation procedure applies to this lease” are included in item 21, the mediation procedure applies to this lease.

          <p id="s1p361">16.2.4 once the mediator has accepted the appointment the parties must comply with the mediator’s instructions.</p>
          <p id="s1p362">16.2.5 if the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of the appointment of the mediator, or any other period agreed by the parties in writing, the mediation ceases,</p>
          <p id="s1p363">16.3 The mediator may fix the charges for the mediation which must be paid equally by the parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p364">16.4 If the dispute is settled, all parties must sign the terms of agreement and these terms are binding on the parties.</p>

          <p id="s1p368">16.6 It must be a term of the engagement of the mediator that the parties release the mediator from any court proceedings relating to the lease or the mediation.</p>
          <p id="s1p369">16.7 The mediator is not bound by the rules of natural justice and may discuss the dispute with a party in the absence of any other party.</p>
          <p id="s1p370">16.8 If the Act applies, so that a dispute must be referred to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, the parties agree that each may be represented by a legal practitioner or legal practitioners of its choice.</p>
          <p id="s1p371">17 GST</p>
          <p id="s1p372">17.1 “GST” means GST within the meaning of the GST Act.</p>
          <p id="s1p373">“GST Act” means A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (as amended). Expressions used in this clause 17 and in the GST Act have the same meanings as when used in the GST Act</p>
          <p id="s1p374">17.2 Except where this lease states otherwise, each amount payable by a party under this lease in respect of a taxable supply by the other party is expressed as a GST exclusive amount and the recipient of the supply must, in addition to that amount and at the same time, pay to the supplier the GST payable in respect of the supply.</p>
          <p id="s1p375">11</p>
          <p id="s1p376">17.3 An amount payable by the tenant in respect of a creditable acquisition by the landlord from a third party must not exceed the sum of the value of the landlord’s acquisition and the additional amount payable by the tenant under clause 17.2 on account of the landlord’s GST liability.</p>
          <p id="s1p377">17.4 A party is not obliged, under clause 17.2, to pay the GST on a taxable supply to it under this Lease, until given a valid tax invoice for the supply.</p>
          <p id="s1p378">17.5 An adjustment of the consideration payable under this lease to take account of the New Tax System changes referred to in the Trade Practices Act 1974 must not constitute price exploitation within the meaning of that Act or breach the guidelines in force from time to time published by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission under Part VB of that Act.</p>
          <p id="s1p379">18 CONSUMER PRICE INDEX</p>
          <p id="s1p380">18.1 “Consumer Price Index” means the index published by the Australian Government Statistician under the heading “All Groups” for Melbourne.</p>
          <p id="s1p381">“Rent adjustment date” means the first day of a year specified in item 16 as a year whose rent will be fixed by reference to the Consumer Price Index.</p>
          <p id="s1p382">“Review date” means a date specified in item 16.</p>
          <p id="s1p383">18.2 An adjustment of rent by reference to the Consumer Price Index is made using the following formula:</p>
          <p id="s1p384">AR = R x CPIB</p>
          <p id="s1p385">CPIA</p>
          <p id="s1p386">where: AR means adjusted rent;</p>
          <p id="s1p387">R means rent before adjustment;</p>
          <p id="s1p388">CPIB means the Consumer Price Index index figure for the quarter preceding the relevant rent adjustment date; and</p>
          <p id="s1p389">CPIA means the Consumer Price Index index figure for the quarter preceding the most recent previous rent adjustment date or review date or, where there is no previous rent adjustment date or review date, the quarter preceding the start of the term.</p>
          <p id="s1p390">18.3 If CPIB is not published until after the rent adjustment date, the adjustment is made when it is published but the adjustment takes effect from the relevant rent adjustment date. In the meantime, the tenant must continue to pay the rent at the old rate and, when the adjustment is made, the tenant must immediately pay the shortfall or the landlord must immediately repay the excess, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p391">18.4 If the base of the Consumer Price Index is changed between the two comparison dates an appropriate compensating adjustment must be made so that a common base is used.</p>
          <p id="s1p392">18.5 If the Consumer Price Index is discontinued or suspended then the calculation is to be made using whatever index is substituted for it. If no other index is substituted for it, the calculation is to be made using the index or calculation which the senior office-bearer of the Australian Property Institute — Victorian Division (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) decides is appropriate in the circumstances. This decision is binding.</p>
          <p id="s1p393">18.6 Unless the Act applies, the adjustment is not made if it would result in a decrease in the rent payable.</p>
