There shall not be any right to review the rent for either premise as at the lease renewal date of 01st November 2011.</p>
          <p id="s1p44">3.</p>
          <p id="s1p45">The rental payable for the three year term commencing 01st November 2008 shall be $37,750.00 (plus GST) per annum in respect of the First Lease and $35,000.00 (plus GST) per annum in respect of the Second Lease, payable by calendar monthly installments in advance on the 01st day of each month during the renewed terms of the First Lease and the Second Lease.</p>
