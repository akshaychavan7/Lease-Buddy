Landlord and its Affiliates covenant that following the Closing and for the Lease Term, any real property retained by Landlord or its Affiliates that is adjacent to or located within one-half mile from any of the Integral Properties and Assets, lying North or West of Interstate 80 (the “Restricted Properties” as described in Exhibit 7) will be developed in a manner complementary to the Integrated Properties and Assets. Landlord shall, prior to entering into any binding agreement to sell, lease, transfer or develop any Restricted Properties disclose to Last Chance its plans for sale, lease, transfer or development, consult with Last Chance regarding any contemplated sale, lease, transfer or development and give fair consideration to any objection communicated by Last Chance that a proposed sale, lease, transfer or development will constitute a breach of this Restrictive Covenant. Landlord and its Affiliates acknowledge and agree that a lottery business of any kind would violate this Restrictive Covenant and that such business shall be prohibited. Landlord shall cause each of its Affiliates to comply with this Restrictive Covenant. Except as herein provided, this Restrictive Covenant will not affect the right of Landlord or its Affiliates to sell, lease, transfer or develop the Restricted Properties as they wish, though Landlord or any affected Affiliate shall be liable, in law or in equity, including actions for injunctive relief and for all damages, losses, costs and expenses actually suffered or incurred by Last Chance as the proximate result of any breach of this Restrictive Covenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p172">(ii) Right of First Refusal-Gaming.</p>
          <p id="s1p173">(a) Right of First Refusal. In the event that Landlord or any Affiliate intends to sell, lease, transfer or develop any of the Restricted Properties during</p>
          <p id="s1p174">18</p>
          <p id="s1p175">the Lease Term, Last Chance shall have the right of first refusal to conduct all forms of commercial gaming under the laws of the States of Nevada and California (Gaming) on such Restricted Properties. Landlord and its Affiliates agree that they will not: (i) engage in Gaming on the Restricted Properties without first offering Last Chance the opportunity to conduct such Gaming on commercially reasonable terms and conditions within the context of the purpose of this Restrictive Covenant which is the protection of the investment of Last Chance in the Integral Properties and Assets (Commercially Reasonable Terms), or (ii) transfer to or permit the development of any of the Restricted Properties by any third party without first securing in writing the right of first refusal of Last Chance with respect to Gaming conducted or to be conducted thereon. This right of first refusal shall be a covenant running with the title to the Restricted Properties and shall be binding on the successors and assigns of Landlord and its Affiliates.</p>
          <p id="s1p176">(b) Notice of Intent To Conduct Gaming. Prior to engaging in Gaming or making application for a license or other authority to engage in Gaming on the Restricted Properties, Landlord, its Affiliates and the successors in interest of any of them (Gaming Proponent), shall give written notice (Notice) to Last Chance stating and declaring: (i) the bona fide intention to engage in Gaming (Gaming Enterprise), (ii) the Restricted Properties upon which the Gaming Enterprise is proposed to be conducted, (iii) the principles involved as owners or proposed key employees in the Gaming Enterprise, (iv) a detailed description of the nature of the proposed Gaming Enterprise, including the number of gaming devices and table games, (v) the Commercially Reasonable Terms upon which the Gaming Enterprise is offered to Last Chance, (vi) the projected date for commencement of the Gaming Enterprise, and (vii) copies of any drafted documents evidencing the proposed Gaming Enterprise, including letters of intent. The failure to offer Commercially Reasonable Terms shall be a violation of the provisions of this Section 8.1(L) and shall render the Notice voidable by Last Chance.</p>
          <p id="s1p177">(c) Notice of Election. Within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Notice, Last Chance shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to conduct the Gaming Enterprise on the Commercially Reasonable Terms set forth in the Notice. Within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Notice, Last Chance shall notify the Gaming Proponent, in writing, of the election of Last Chance to exercise its right of first refusal (Notice of Election). The failure of Last Chance to give a timely Notice of Election shall constitute an election not to exercise. In the event that Last Chance elects to exercise its right of first refusal, the Gaming Proponent and Last Chance shall execute such documents and instruments and make such deliveries as may be reasonably required to consummate the transaction. Any agreement reached by and between Last Chance and the Gaming Proponent shall be subject to approval by Nevada and/or California Gaming Authorities and shall terminate in the event that any such approval is denied.</p>
          <p id="s1p178">(d) Non-Exercise. If Last Chance elects or is deemed to have elected not to exercise its right of first refusal the Gaming Proponent may proceed with the Gaming Enterprise providing that: (i) the Gaming Enterprise commences within the period provided in the Notice or if none is provided, within eighteen (18) months after the expiration of Last Chance’s right of first refusal, (ii) is conducted on terms identical to those specified in the Notice, (iii) the transferee takes, and acknowledges in writing that it</p>
          <p id="s1p179">19</p>
          <p id="s1p180">takes title to the Restricted Properties subject to Last Chance’s rights under this Lease, specifically including, without limitation, the rights of Last Chance under Section 8.1(L) of this Lease and the Integrated Agreements, and (iv) all deeds and other documents by which the Restricted Properties are conveyed recite that title thereto is taken subject to the rights of Last Chance under Section 8.1(L) of this Lease and the other Integrated Agreements (with specific reference to all pertinent recording information) and that the grantee, lessee, transferee or assignee, as the case may be, is bound thereby. If the Gaming Enterprise is not consummated, the Gaming Proponent giving the Notice, or the successors thereto, must give notice anew in accordance with Section 8.1(L)(b) prior to engaging in any subsequent Gaming Enterprise. In the event that a Gaming Enterprise is threatened or commenced on any of the Restricted Properties, Landlord and its Affiliates, shall, upon demand by Last Chance and at the sole cost and expense of Landlord and its Affiliates, take such actions as may be necessary to protect the rights of Last Chance hereunder, including actions for injunctive relief and damages, and indemnify, protect and defend Last Chance (including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by Last Chance) from and against the claims of any such Gaming Proponent.</p>
          <p id="s1p181">(e) Enforcement by Injunctive Relief. Landlord and its Affiliates have carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon them and the rights and remedies conferred upon Last Chance under this Section 8.1(L) and acknowledge that they are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of Last Chance and do not confer a benefit upon Last Chance disproportionate to the detriment of Landlord or its Affiliates.

Landlord and its Affiliates agree that should they, or any of them, violate any of the terms and conditions of this Section 8.1(L)(ii), they shall be liable, in law or in equity, including actions for injunctive relief and for all damages, losses, costs and expenses actually suffered or incurred by Last Chance as the proximate result of any breach of Section 8.1(L)(ii).</p>
          <p id="s1p182">Nothing in this Lease shall be construed to prohibit Last Chance from also pursuing any other remedy, at law or in equity, the parties having agreed that all remedies shall be cumulative. Nothing in Section 8.1(L)(ii) or (iii) shall constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver by the right of Last Chance to contend that any Gaming Enterprise constitutes or will constitute a violation of the Restrictive Covenant under Section 8.1(L)(i).</p>
          <p id="s1p183">(iii) No Waiver. Nothing contained in Section 8.1(L)(ii) shall be construed to constitute a waiver by Last Chance of the right to object to development deemed by Last Chance not to be complimentary to the Integral Properties and Assets.</p>
          <p id="s1p184">8.2 Representations and Warranties of Last Chance. Last Chance represents and warrants to Landlord that each of the following representations and warranties are true and correct as of the date hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, will be true and correct on the as of the Closing and the close of escrow in the event of a purchase by it under the Option to Purchase the Gold Ranch Casino Property.</p>
