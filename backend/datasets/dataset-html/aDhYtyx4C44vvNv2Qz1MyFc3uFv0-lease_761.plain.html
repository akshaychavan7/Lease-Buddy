          <p id="s1p79">OFFICE LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p80">THIS LEASE is made and entered into on this 22nd day of December, 1986, by and between West*Mac Associates Limited Partnership, a Virginia limited partnership, hereinafter called “Landlord”, and The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, a federally chartered corporation hereinafter called “Tenant”.</p>
          <p id="s1p81">WITNESSETH, that for and in consideration of the rents, mutual covenants, and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto do hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p82">1. DEMISED PREMISES; TENANT IMPROVEMENTS.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">(A) Landlord does hereby lease to Tenant, and Tenant does hereby lease from Landlord, for the term and upon the conditions hereinafter provided, the building(s) located at the corner of Jones Branch Drive and International Drive in Tysons Corner, Virginia (hereinafter referred to as the “Building”), together with associated parking areas and the land legally described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the Building, parking areas and land being hereinafter referred to as the “Demised Premises”), subject to all easements, rights of way and encumbrances of record.</p>
          <p id="s1p84">(B) Tenant shall be responsible for constructing all the improvements to be made to the Demised Premises in connection with Tenant’s use and occupancy of the Building. Prior to commencing any such improvements, Tenant shall, at its own expense, secure all necessary building permits and shall comply with all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations. All improvements made to the Demised Premises and any equipment installed therein (except for Tenant’s trade fixtures) shall immediately become the property of Landlord and shall remain attached to the Demised Premises upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and shall not be removed by Tenant, provided, however, that Tenant at its election may remove any such improvements or equipment upon such expiration or termination, provided Tenant restores any damage caused by such removal and the Building is in compliance with applicable building codes after such removal. Tenant may alter or change the exterior of the Building or the exterior of any parking structures, provided, however, that Tenant shall be obligated to restore such exteriors to their original condition upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not make any alteration or improvement and shall not remove any property which requires the consent of the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust on the Property without obtaining such consent.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">2. RENT</p>
          <p id="s1p86">(A) The minimum annual rent (“Basic Annual Rent”) payable hereunder for the first year of the term of this Lease shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:</p>
          <p id="s1p87">Total Cost of Building Shell for the Demised Premises (including land, but excluding 1.1 times construction period interest on land if drawn by the borrower)</p>
          <p id="s1p88">× Mortgage Constant (as defined in Landlord’s Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement) on the Permanent Financing for the Demised Premises</p>
          <p id="s1p89">× 1.1</p>
          <p id="s1p90">Plus (+)</p>
          <p id="s1p91">1.1 × Construction Period Interest on Land</p>
          <p id="s1p92">× Mortgage Constant on the Permanent Financing for the Demised Premises</p>
          <p id="s1p93">= Base Annual Rent</p>
          <p id="s1p94">For purposes of calculating the “Total Cost of Building Shell” the definition of Building Shell set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto shall be used. Basic Annual Rent shall be payable monthly, in advance, in installments of one-twelfth of Basic Annual Rent, with the first such monthly installment being due and payable on the Lease Commencement Date (as hereinafter defined) and the remaining monthly installments being due and payable on the first day of each calendar month following the Lease Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Lease Commencement Date falls on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, then the first monthly installment of Basic Annual Rent, which shall cover the period from the Lease Commencement Date to the last day of the calendar month during which the Lease Commencement Date occurs, shall be adjusted on a per diem basis. Basic Annual Rent shall be adjusted each year following the first Lease year as provided in Paragraph 5 hereof. Any sums owing to Landlord from Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease other than Basic Annual Rent, including, but not limited to, Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes shall be additional rent and may hereinafter be referred to as “Additional Rent”.</p>
          <p id="s1p95">(B) All monthly installments of Basic Annual Rent and Additional Rent shall be due and payable without notice or demand and shall not be subject to any deduction, set-off or counterclaim by Tenant. If Landlord shall at any time accept an installment of Basic Annual Rent after the same shall become due and payable, such acceptance shall not excuse a delay upon subsequent occasions, or constitute, or be construed as, a waiver of any of Landlord’s rights hereunder arising from such late payment.</p>
          <p id="s1p96">(C) Tenant agrees to pay each installment of Basic Annual Rent and all Additional Rent as and when due. If Tenant shall fail to pay any such rent on the due date therefor and if such failure shall cause a late payment or default by Landlord under any mortgage or deed of trust secured by the Demised Premises and if Landlord’s mortgagee shall assess and collect any penalty, fee or increased interest in connection therewith, Tenant shall reimburse all such amounts to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p97">- 2 -</p>
          <p id="s1p98">(D) It is the intent of Landlord and Tenant that this shall be a “triple net” lease and Landlord shall not have any obligation with respect to operating and capital expenses and costs, including, but not limited to, insurance and real estate taxes incurred in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Demised Premises, Tenant agreeing to bear sole responsibility for all such costs, expenses and taxes.</p>
          <p id="s1p99">3. TERM</p>
          <p id="s1p100">(A) The term of this Lease shall be for a period of twenty (20) years, commencing on the Lease Commencement Date and terminating at 11:59 p.m. on the date (the “Expiration Date”) immediately preceding the twentieth annual anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Lease Commencement Date falls on a date other than the first day of a calendar month, then the Expiration Date shall be extended to the last day of the calendar month following the twentieth anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p101">(B) For purposes of this Lease, the “Lease Commencement Date” shall be the first to occur of (i) Tenant’s actual occupancy of all or any portion of the Building, or (ii) six months after a final non-residential use permit for the shell of the Building is issued by the appropriate governmental authority.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">(C) If Tenant shall occupy less than all of the usable space in the Building after the Lease Commencement Date determined in accordance with Section 3(B)(i) above, the Basic Annual Rent shall be adjusted to reflect the portion of the Building actually occupied by Tenant, provided that in all events the total Basic Annual Rent provided for in this Lease shall be due and payable commencing on the date determined in accordance with Section 3(B)(ii) above.</p>
          <p id="s1p103">(D) From and after the date the Owner reasonably determines that the Demised Premises are ready for commencement of construction and installation of leasehold improvements, Tenant shall be entitled to enter the Demised Premises for the purpose of construction and installation of Tenant’s leasehold improvements. During said period, neither Tenant nor Tenant’s contractors shall interfere with work being performed at the Demised Premises by Landlord or Landlord’s contractor. Tenant shall be responsible for the cost of all utilities and scavenger service from and after the date the final non-residential use permit for the shell of the Building is issued by the appropriate governmental authority.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">4. USE</p>
          <p id="s1p105">Tenant will use and occupy the Building solely for general office purposes and in accordance with applicable laws, ordinances and zoning regulations. The Building will not be used for any other purpose without the prior written consent of Landlord. Tenant will not use or occupy the Building for any unlawful purpose, and will comply with all present and future laws, ordinances, regulations, and orders of all governments, government agencies and any other public authority having jurisdiction over the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">- 3 -</p>
          <p id="s1p107">5. ADJUSTMENT OF BASIC ANNUAL RENT FOR COST OF LIVING INCREASES.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">(A) Commencing on the first anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date and thereafter on each successive anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date (each such anniversary shall, for purposes of this Paragraph, be referred to as the “Adjustment Date”) for the first ten (10) years of the term hereof, on the Adjustment Date the Basic Annual Rent (and the monthly installments thereof) shall be increased by an amount determined as follows: Basic Annual Rent shall be multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which shall be the CPI (as hereinafter defined) for the most recently published period ending prior to the Lease Commencement Date, and the numerator of which shall be the difference between the CPI for the most recently published period immediately prior to the Lease Commencement Date and the CPI for the most recently published period immediately prior to the applicable Adjustment Date, multiplied by thirty percent (30%); provided, however, that in no event shall the Basic Annual Rent increase more than three percent (3%) on any Adjustment Date. Such increased Basic Annual Rent shall be the Basic Annual Rent payable hereunder until again adjusted as provided herein. Written notice of the amount of the adjusted Basic Annual Rent and the monthly installments thereof shall be delivered to Tenant by Landlord, although the payment of such increased Basic Annual Rent shall not be contingent upon the delivery of such notice and such increase shall be self effectuating.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">(B) For purposes of this Lease, the “CPI” shall be the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) — All Items (1967=100) for the Washington, D.C.-Md.-Va. metropolitan area prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor and published bi-monthly. If, during the term of this Lease, the CPI ceases to be published, then Landlord shall have the right to substitute another similar index generally recognized as authoritative by reconciling the base thereof with the base of the CPI. If the concept of the CPI is substantially changed but the index itself is retained with such substantial changes, Landlord shall have the right to make equitable adjustments in the published indices in order to fairly reflect what would have been future increases in the CPI had such substantial changes not been made.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">(C) Commencing with the tenth anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date, the Basic Annual Rent shall be adjusted so as to be ninety percent (90%) of then effective market rent for similar class office buildings in Tysons Corner or comparable markets. Said effective market rent shall be determined by excluding from the actual market rents for such similar class office buildings any amounts attributable to brokerage or leasing commissions, rent abatement or free rent periods and other marketing factors. Basic Annual Rent shall be adjusted over the remaining ten years of the Lease in accordance with market adjustments for leases of similar duration in effect on the tenth anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date. The effective market rent for similar properties shall be determined by appraisers selected by the partners of Landlord in accordance with Section 5.4(7) of Landlord’s Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement. In no event shall the Basic Annual Rent payable in the eleventh year of the Lease be less than the Basic Annual Rent payable during the immediately preceding year.</p>

          <p id="s1p112">6. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING</p>
          <p id="s1p113">Tenant shall have the right, without the need for Landlord’s consent in any instance, to assign this Lease or sublet the Demised Premises or any portions thereof subject to this Lease and the terms and conditions hereof, on such terms and conditions as Tenant shall decide. In the event of an assignment of all or any portion of the Lease or a subletting of all or any portion of the Demised Premises, Tenant shall give Landlord notice of such assignment or subletting and Tenant shall remain fully liable for the obligations of Tenant under this Lease. Tenant will not mortgage or encumber this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">7. MAINTENANCE BY TENANT</p>
          <p id="s1p115">Tenant shall keep the Demised Premises and the fixtures and equipment therein in clean, safe and sanitary condition, will take good care thereof, will suffer no waste or injury thereto, and shall at all times keep the Demised Premises in good order and repair including without limitation all necessary structural repairs and replacements.

Landlord shall have the right to enter upon the Demised Premises during regular business hours to ensure Tenant’s compliance with the terms and provisions of this Lease, and to cure any default by Tenant with regard to upkeep, maintenance and repair of the Demised Premises, and to exhibit the Demised Premises to prospective tenants during the last year of this Lease prior to the expiration of the term hereof or of any Extension Term (as hereinafter defined).</p>
          <p id="s1p116">8. OPERATING COSTS AND REAL ESTATE TAXES.</p>
          <p id="s1p117">(a) Tenant shall, be responsible for all Operating Costs of the Demised Premises incurred in the operation, maintenance and repair of the Demised Premises. Tenant shall also be responsible for and shall pay directly to the appropriate taxing authority 100% of all Real Estate Taxes imposed against the Demised Premises. It is intended that Landlord shall have no obligation for Operating Costs or Real Estate Taxes in connection with the Demised Premises and the same shall be borne solely by the Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">(b) The term “Operating Costs of the Demised Premises” is defined as any and all expenses incurred in connection with the operation, maintenance and repair (including structural repair and maintenance) of the Building and related exterior appurtenances, associated parking areas and land, including, but not limited to, utilities (whether they be electric, gas, telephone, water, sewer, and/or heat), char (cleaning) services, trash removal, landscaping, and repair and replacement costs, excluding only interest and amortization of mortgages and depreciation of the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p119">(c) The term “Real Estate Taxes” shall mean the total amount of all taxes and assessments, general and special, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, of every kind, character or description, now or hereafter assessed, levied</p>
          <p id="s1p120">- 5 -</p>

In the event that any business tax, rental tax or other taxes which are now or hereafter levied upon (i) Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Demised Premises, (ii) Tenant’s leasehold improvements, (iii) Tenant’s business at the Demised Premises, or (iv) Landlord by virtue of Tenant’s occupancy of the Demised Premises, are enacted, changed or altered so that any of such taxes are levied against Landlord, or in the event that the mode of collection of such taxes is changed so that Landlord is responsible for collection or payment of such taxes, any and all such taxes (and increases thereof) shall be included within the definition of Real Estate Taxes and Tenant shall pay the full amount of all of such taxes as provided in this Paragraph 8.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">(d) Tenant shall provide Landlord with copies of paid receipts for Real Estate Taxes and the insurance required by Section 9 hereof, at least five (5) prior to the due date thereof or the expiration of any required policy of insurance, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">9. INSURANCE; DAMAGE TO THE BUILDING, THE DEMISED PREMISES, OR TENANT IMPROVEMENTS</p>
          <p id="s1p124">(A) Tenant agrees, at its sole cost and expense, at all times during the term of this Lease to keep the Demised Premises insured against loss or damage by fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, aircraft, vehicles and smoke, in an amount as reasonably determined by Landlord, with a full replacement cost endorsement. Tenant shall carry such other insurance as Landlord’s mortgagee may reasonably require. Tenant agrees that Landlord shall be named as an additional insured on such insurance policy, and that Landlord’s mortgagee shall be named as mortgagee therein pursuant to a standard mortgagee clause, naming mortgagee as loss payee.</p>

Tenant agrees that Landlord and Landlord’s mortgagee shall be named as an additional insured on such insurance policy.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">(C) Tenant shall be responsible for insuring all personal property and equipment of Tenant within the Demised Premises. All personal property of the Tenant, its employees, agents, business invitees, licensees, customers, clients, family members, guests or trespassers in and on the Demised Premises shall be and remain on the Demised Premises at Tenant’s sole risk, and Landlord shall not be liable to such persons for any damage to, or for loss of, such personal property.</p>

          <p id="s1p130">(E) All insurance policies required by the terms of Paragraph 9 to be carried by Tenant shall contain a provision to the effect that such policies cannot be cancelled or materially changed without at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice to Landlord and Landlord’s mortgagee and shall be with companies approved by Landlord’s mortgagee. If Tenant fails to obtain any insurance it is required to obtain pursuant to this Lease after thirty (30) days’ notice, then Landlord may obtain such insurance, in which case the premium for such insurance shall be deemed additional rent due and payable from Tenant with the next regular installment of Basic Annual Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">10. ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS</p>
          <p id="s1p132">After completion of construction of Tenant’s initial improvements to the Demised Premises, Tenant will not make any alterations, additions or changes, in or to the Demised Premises without obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord. If Landlord’s consent is obtained, all work performed by Tenant must be done at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, in a good and workmanlike manner, by duly licensed contractors, in accordance with plans approved by Landlord and all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

If Tenant shall fail to discharge any such mechanic’s lien as aforesaid, Landlord may, at its option, discharge the same and treat the cost thereof as Additional Rent payable with the monthly installment of Annual Rent next becoming due; it being hereby expressly covenanted and agreed that such discharge of any mechanic’s lien by Landlord shall not be deemed to waive or release the default of Tenant in not discharging the same.</p>

          <p id="s1p143">If (i) Tenant shall fail to pay in full any monthly installment of Annual Rent within ten (10) days after written notice of such failure from Landlord (or any Partner of Landlord), or (ii) Tenant shall vacate, abandon or otherwise not occupy the Building, or (iii) Tenant shall violate or fail to perform any of the other conditions, covenants or agreements herein made by Tenant and such violation or failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant (unless such violation is of a nature such that, in Landlord’s judgment, the passage of thirty (30) days would result in a material adverse effect to the Building or Landlord, in which event Landlord’s notice may specify a period of time shorter than thirty (30) days and there shall be no right to extension or postponement of such period), this Lease shall, at the option of Landlord, cease and terminate, any notice to quit or of Landlord’s intention to re-enter being hereby expressly waived, and Landlord may proceed to recover possession of the Building under and by virtue of the provisions of the laws of the State of Virginia or by such other proceedings, including re-entry and possession, as may be applicable. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease, everything herein contained on the part of Landlord to be done and performed shall cease without prejudice to the right of Landlord to recover from Tenant all Annual Rent and other sums owing hereunder accrued up to the time of termination of this Lease or the recovery of possession of the Building by Landlord, whichever is later. Should this Lease be terminated prior to the Expiration Date by reason of Tenant’s default as hereinabove provided, or if Tenant shall abandon or vacate the Building before the Expiration Date, the Demised Premises may be relet by Landlord for such rent and upon such terms as Landlord may determine and, if the full Annual Rent and other sums owing hereunder shall not be realized by Landlord pursuant to such reletting, Tenant shall be liable for all damages sustained by Landlord, including, without limitation, deficiency in Annual Rent and other sums owing hereunder, reasonable attorneys’ fees, brokerage fees, and the expense of placing</p>

Any damage or loss of Annual Rent and other sums owing hereunder sustained by Landlord may be recovered by Landlord, at Landlord’s option, at the time of such reletting, or in separate actions, or, at Landlord’s option, may be deferred until the expiration of the term of this Lease, in which event Landlord’s cause of action against Tenant shall not be deemed to have accrued until the Expiration Date. The provisions contained in this Paragraph 14 shall be in addition to and shall not prevent the enforcement of any claim Landlord may have against Tenant for anticipatory breach of the unexpired term of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p146">15. WAIVER</p>
          <p id="s1p147">If under the provisions hereof Landlord shall institute proceedings and a compromise or settlement thereof shall be made, the same shall not constitute a waiver of any covenant herein contained nor of any of Landlord’s rights hereunder except as set forth in such compromise or settlement. No waiver by Landlord of any breach of any covenant, condition, or agreement herein contained shall operate as a waiver of any future breach of such covenant, condition or agreement. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the monthly installment of Annual Rent then due shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest stipulated Annual Rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or letter accompanying a check for payment of Annual Rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover the balance of such Annual Rent or to pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease. No re-entry by Landlord and no acceptance by Landlord of keys from Tenant shall be considered an acceptance of a surrender of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">16. SUBORDINATION</p>

In confirmation of such subordination, Tenant shall, at Landlord’s request, promptly execute any requisite or appropriate certificate or other document. Tenant agrees that in the event that any proceedings are brought for the foreclosure of any such mortgage, Tenant shall attorn to the purchaser at such foreclosure sale, if requested to do so by such purchaser, and shall recognize such purchaser as the Landlord under this Lease, and Tenant waives the provisions of any statute or rule of law, now or hereafter in effect, which may give or purport to give Tenant any right to terminate or otherwise adversely affect this Lease and the obligations of Tenant hereunder in the event that any such foreclosure proceeding is prosecuted or completed.</p>
          <p id="s1p150">(B) If the Demised Premises, or any part thereof is at any time subject to a mortgage and in connection with such mortgage, this Lease or the rentals under this Lease, are assigned to the mortgagee, trustee or beneficiary under such mortgage, and Tenant is given written notice thereof, including the post office</p>

          <p id="s1p153">17. CONDEMNATION</p>
          <p id="s1p154">If the whole or a substantial part of the Building shall be taken or condemned by any governmental authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, then the term of this Lease shall cease and terminate as of the date when title vests in such governmental authority, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord or the condemning authority for any portion of the amount that may be awarded as damages as a result of such taking or condemnation or for the value of any unexpired term of the Lease. Tenant may make a separate claim against the condemning authority for a separate award for the value of all improvement installed or constructed in the Building by Tenant and any of Tenant’s tangible personal property and trade fixtures or consequential damages as may be allowed by law, provided that the awards for such claims are made by the applicable adjudicatory body in addition to, and separate from, the award made by such adjudicatory body for the Land, Building or portions thereof so taken. If less than a substantial part of the Building is taken or condemned by any governmental authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, the monthly installments of Basic Annual Rent due hereunder shall be equitably adjusted on the date when title vests in such governmental authority and the Lease shall otherwise continue in full force and effect. For purposes of this Paragraph 17 a substantial part of the Building shall be considered to have been taken if more than fifty percent (50%) of the Building is unusable by Tenant.</p>
