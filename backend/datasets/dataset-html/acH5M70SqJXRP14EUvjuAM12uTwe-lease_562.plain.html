          <p id="s1p171">The Lessee, in return, waives all recourse that it would be entitled to exercise against the Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p172">These waivers of recourse between the Lessee and the Lessor do not prohibit their respective insurers from exercising methods of recourse between them.</p>

          <p id="s1p189">Article 13: ASSIGNMENT OF LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p190">The Lessee may not assign its right to the present lease without the express, written consent of the Lessor. However, it may freely assign the right to the lease for all the rented premises to the buyer of its successor in business.</p>
          <p id="s1p191">Any assignment must take place by notarial act or private deed, which the Lessor will be called upon to attend. The assignees must jointly undertake, with the Lessee, to pay the rent and perform the conditions of the lease. The Lessee shall remain jointly responsible with its successor and all subsequent successors for payment of the rent and performance of the conditions of the lease until expiration thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">In addition, the Lessee may not assign its business without first offering the purchase to the Lessor. After notification by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt served in relation to the business assignment project, the latter shall have a period of one month to inform the Lessee if it wishes to purchase it at the conditions offered or at conditions to be negotiated between the parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p193">In the latter case, the assignment must take place in the month the Lessor exercises its right of pre-emption, failing which this pre-emption shall be deemed null and void. If no response is received in the established period, it shall be assumed that the Lessor has chosen not to exercise the right of pre-emption.</p>
          <p id="s1p194">In addition, all those who may subsequently become assignees of the Lease shall remain obligated to the Lessor, jointly between themselves and the Lessee, to pay the rent and perform the conditions of the lease throughout the duration thereof, even if they are no longer in the premises and have assigned their right.</p>
          <p id="s1p195">A certified copy of the assignment deed or a registered original must be submitted to the Lessor, at no cost for the latter, the Lessee being obligated to comply with the rules of article 1690 of the Civil Code.</p>
          <p id="s1p196">Article 14: SUBLETTING</p>
          <p id="s1p197">The Lessee may not hand over all or part of the premises to any party by conferring possession thereof to a third party, in any form, even as a loan, sublet, or similar, without the express, written consent of the Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p198">In the event that the partial sublet of the premises is authorized, it is expressly agreed that all the premises under this lease shall retain their indivisible nature by the joint intent of the parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p199">Thus, the Lessor shall not be obligated to renew the sublets on expiration of the contract.</p>
          <p id="s1p200">Any sublet must take place by official or private deed, which the Lessor will be called upon to attend.</p>
          <p id="s1p201">The subtenants must jointly undertake, with the Lessee, to pay the rent and perform the conditions of the lease.

          <p id="s1p206">The Lessee shall personally arrange to obtain telephone lines and telephone installation and shall therefore be the titleholder of its lines.</p>

          <p id="s1p208">Prior to moving out, the Lessee must, before even partially removing furniture and equipment, have settled all the rental installments and maintenance and service charges, and provide evidence of this by submitting payment receipts of the contributions for which it is responsible, both for the elapsed years and the current year.</p>
          <p id="s1p209">The Lessee must, no later than the lease expiration date, at any time and for any reason, leave the rented premises and all fittings, installations, improvements, additions, and embellishments, without compensation and in good condition, which will be reported in a schedule of condition, following which the Lessee must hand the keys over to the Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p210">In particular, the Lessee must assume liability for the costs, including paintwork, floors, floor coverings, walls, ceilings, and any layout fittings inside the premises, as well as the surrounding amenities, so as to leave the premises in good condition, without being able to invoke wear or tear, even normal. The inventory, the date of which shall be determined by mutual agreement of the parties, shall, if applicable, include a report of repairs to be done. This inventory may be preceded by a preliminary inventory.</p>
          <p id="s1p211">Notwithstanding the handover of the keys, the lease shall continue until the expiration date, with the rent remaining payable up to this date. Failing this, the inventory will be drawn up on the lease expiration date. If the Lessee is not present at the time and date set for the inventory, the latter may be established, if the Lessor sees fit, in the presence of a bailiff, who may be accompanied by a locksmith in order to gain entry to the premises, with the corresponding costs being exclusively payable by the Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p212">If repairs or works are necessary, the Lessee must, within fifteen days of notification of the estimates, issued at the request of the Lessor, approve the said estimates.</p>
          <p id="s1p213">If the Lessee does not express its intention in the above period, the estimates will be deemed as approved and the Lessor may have the work done by companies of its choice, and claim the amount from the Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p214">If the Lessee expresses its intention to perform the work itself, it must undertake, as an essential and decisive condition, to have it performed by qualified companies approved by the Lessor.</p>
