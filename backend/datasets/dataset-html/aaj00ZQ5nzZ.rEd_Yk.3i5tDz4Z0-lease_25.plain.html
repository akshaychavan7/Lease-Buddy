For the avoidance of doubt, Tenant may only elect to purchase all of the Facility and may not elect to purchase some but not all of the Facility.</p>
          <p id="s1p161">(d) Landlord and Tenant shall have a period of thirty (30) days after Landlord’s receipt of the Purchase Notice (the “Purchase Agreement Period”) to negotiate in good faith a purchase and sale agreement and related documentation necessary to complete the disposition of the Facility (the “Purchase Documentation”). The Purchase Documentation shall contain the purchase price, earnest money deposit, and other material terms and conditions contained in the Third Party Offer. In the event Landlord and Tenant enter into the Purchase Documentation within the Purchase Agreement Period, then the transaction that is the subject of such Purchase Documentation shall be consummated within thirty (30) days after the execution thereof (the “Closing Date”).</p>
          <p id="s1p162">21</p>
          <p id="s1p163">(e) In the event that (i) Tenant does not timely provide the Purchase Notice, (ii) Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Purchase Documentation within the Purchase Agreement Period, or (iii) following execution of the Purchase Documentation, the transaction that is the subject thereof is not consummated on or before the Closing Date as a result of a default by Tenant in its obligations under the Purchase Documentation, then Landlord shall be free to sell the Facility to the third party who submitted the Third Party Offer on terms not materially more favorable to the acquiring party than are set forth in the applicable Third Party Offer.

Code”) with respect to the Premises, (2) Tenant reporting its Rent payments as rent expense under Section 162 of the Code, and (3) Landlord reporting the Rent payments as rental income. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Lease shall be deemed to constitute a guaranty, warranty or representation by either Landlord or Tenant as to the actual treatment of this transaction for state law purposes and for federal income tax purposes.</p>
          <p id="s1p167">25. Landlord will construct or install in the Premises the improvements required by Tenant to operate its business in the Premises, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, including the improvements referenced in Exhibit G hereto (the Tenant Improvements. “Tenant Improvements”).

Landlord will promptly correct any commercially reasonable deficiencies in the Tenant Improvements identified by Tenant, at Landlord’s expense. The Tenant Improvements will not be deemed completed until Tenant has received a final CO from the applicable municipal department and Tenant has approved the Tenant Improvements, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Once the construction work has been substantially completed, Landlord shall permit Tenant to enter the Premises for the installation of telephone and telecommunications equipment, office furniture and trade fixtures and performing such other work as Tenant deems necessary.</p>
          <p id="s1p170">26. Landlord hereby grants to Tenant or Tenant’s assignee, an option to purchase the Premises, including the Building and all common areas (the Option to Purchase. “Option to Purchase”), within the initial four (4) years of the Initial Term (the “Option Period”).

If Tenant exercises the Option to Purchase, the Purchase Price for the Premises will be the Fair Market Value (“FMV”) of the Premises (as determined pursuant to Exhibit B), valuing the FMV of the physical real estate only and not the value of this Lease or any other leases. In no event will the FMV be less than i) Four Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,300,000.00), plus ii) the amount of the unamortized Tenant Improvements referenced in Section 2.3 above. If the parties proceed to a closing on the Option purchase (a “Closing”), Tenant will pay the first $100,000.00 of the ordinary, commercially reasonable Closing Costs (e.g., title insurance premiums, transfer taxes, professional fees, title company fees, etc., but not including attorneys’ fees and costs); Landlord will pay for any Closing Costs that exceed $100,000.00. If Tenant exercises the Option to Purchase, the parties will work diligently and in good faith to conduct a Closing on the transaction applying the standards used in Lee County, Florida on commercial transactions.</p>

          <p id="s1p223">FAIR MARKET VALUE</p>
          <p id="s1p224">or “Fair Market Value” “Fair Market Rent” means the fair market value (or fair market rent, as applicable) of the Premises or applicable portion thereof on a specified date as agreed to by the parties, or failing such agreement within ten (10) days after such date, as established pursuant the following appraisal process. Each party shall within ten (10) days after written demand by the other select one MAI Appraiser to participate in the determination of Fair Market Value or Fair Market Rent, as applicable. For all purposes under this Lease, the Fair Market Value shall be the fair market value of the Premises or applicable portion thereof unencumbered by this Lease. Within ten (10) days after such selection, the MAI Appraisers so selected by the parties shall select a third (3rd) MAI Appraiser. The three (3) selected MAI Appraisers shall each determine the Fair Market Value (or, as applicable, Fail Market Rent) of the Premises or applicable portion thereof within thirty (30) days after the selection of the third appraiser. To the extent consistent with sound appraisal practices as then existing at the time of any such appraisal, and if requested by Landlord, such appraisal shall be made on a basis consistent with the basis on which the Premises or applicable portion thereof were appraised at the time of their acquisition by Landlord. Tenant shall pay the fees and expenses of any MAI Appraiser retained pursuant to this Exhibit.</p>
          <p id="s1p225">If either party fails to select a MAI Appraiser within the time period set forth in the foregoing paragraph, the MAI Appraiser selected by the other party shall alone determine the fair market value (or, as applicable, fair market rent) of the Premises or applicable portion thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Exhibit and the Fair Market Value (or Fair Market Rent) so determined shall be binding upon the parties. If the MAI Appraisers selected by the parties are unable to agree upon a third (3rd) MAI Appraiser within the time period set forth in the foregoing paragraph, either party shall have the right to apply at Tenant’s expense to the presiding judge of the court of original trial jurisdiction in the county in which the Premises or applicable portion thereof are located to name the third (3rd) MAI Appraiser.</p>
          <p id="s1p226">Within five(5) days after completion of the third (3rd) MAI Appraiser’s appraisal, all three (3) MAI Appraisers shall meet and a majority of the MAI Appraisers shall attempt to determine the fair market value (or, as applicable, fair market rent) of the Premises or applicable portion thereof. If a majority are unable to determine the fair market value (or fair market rent) at such meeting, the three (3) appraisals shall be added together and their total divided by three (3). The resulting quotient shall be the Fair Market Value (or, as applicable, Fair Market Rent). If, however, either or both of the low appraisal or the high appraisal are more than ten percent (10%) lower or higher than the middle appraisal, any such lower or higher appraisal shall be disregarded. If only one (1) appraisal is disregarded, the remaining two (2) appraisals shall be added together and their total divided by two (2), and the resulting quotient shall be such Fair Market Value (or, as applicable, Fair Market Rent). If both the lower appraisal and higher appraisal are disregarded as provided herein, the middle appraisal shall be such Fair Market Value (or Fair Market Rent). In any event, the result of the foregoing appraisal process shall be final and binding.</p>
          <p id="s1p227">shall mean an appraiser licensed or otherwise qualified to do business in the state(s) where the Premises or applicable portion thereof are located and who has substantial experience in performing appraisals of Facility similar to the Premises or applicable portion thereof and is certified as a member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers or certified as a SRPA by the Society of Real Estate Appraisers, or, if such organizations no longer exist or certify appraisers, such successor organization or such other organization as is approved by Landlord.“MAI Appraiser”</p>
