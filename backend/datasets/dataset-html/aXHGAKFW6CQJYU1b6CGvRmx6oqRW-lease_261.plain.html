Operating Expenses shall include the cost of capital improvements made by Landlord to manage, operate or maintain the Building, together with any financing charges incurred in connection therewith, provided that such costs shall be amortized over the useful life of the improvements and only the portion attributable to the Fiscal Year shall be included in Operating Expenses for the Fiscal Year, except that no portion thereof which is attributable to any capital improvement which is completed at any time prior to the expiration of the Base Year shall be included in Operating Expenses for any Fiscal Year (including, but not limited to, the Base Year) and further provided, that such expenditures shall be limited to (i) those replacements of building elements with other building elements which serve similar purposes and which are reasonably necessary to keep the Building in good repair, in Landlord’s judgment, and which will not change the character of the Building, (ii) improvements or building elements added to the Building which in Landlord’s judgment will increase the efficiency of the Building (i.e., are anticipated by Landlord to reduce Operating Expenses as they relate to the item which is the subject of the capital expenditure or to reduce the rate of increase in the Operating Expenses which relates to the item which is the subject of the capital expenditure from what it otherwise may have been reasonably anticipated to be in the absence of such capital expenditure), or (iii) improvements which are required to comply with the requirements of any laws, regulations, or insurance or utility company requirements. Operating Expenses shall not include: (i) Real Estate Tax Expenses, (ii) payments of principal and interest on any Mortgages, (iii) leasing commissions, (iv) costs of preparing, improving or altering any space in preparation for occupancy of any new or renewal tenant, (v) legal fees incurred by Landlord in the preparation or negotiation of leases in the Building and amendments thereto, or (vi)</p>
          <p id="s1p90">2</p>
          <p id="s1p91">expenses in connection with services or other benefits of a type or quantity beyond the scope of this Lease which are not made available to Tenant but which are provided to one or more other tenants or occupants of the Building. In the event that, during any Fiscal Year, Base Year or portion thereof during the Term, Landlord shall furnish any utility or service which is included in the definition of Operating Expenses to less than one hundred percent (100%) of the rentable area of the Building because (i) less than all of the rentable area of the Building is occupied, (ii) any such utility or service is not desired or required by any tenant, or (iii) any tenant is itself obtaining or providing any such utility or service, then the Operating Expenses for such Fiscal Year and the Base Year shall be increased to equal the total expenses that Landlord reasonably estimates it would have incurred if Landlord had provided all such utilities and services to one hundred percent (100%) of the rentable area of the Building for the entire Fiscal Year or Base Year. For example, if the average occupancy rate of the Building during a Fiscal Year is eighty percent (80%), the janitorial contractor’s charges are $1.00 per occupied rentable square foot per year, and the Building contains one hundred thousand (100,000) rentable square feet of space, then it would be reasonable for Landlord to estimate that, if the Building had been one hundred percent (100%) occupied during the entire Fiscal Year, janitorial charges for such Fiscal Year would have been One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and to compute the Operating Expenses for such Fiscal Year accordingly. In no event shall the provisions of this paragraph be used to enable, Landlord to collect from the tenants of the Building more than one hundred percent (100%) of the costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in managing, operating and maintaining the Building and the Land.</p>

          <p id="s1p94">R.

Real Estate Tax Expenses also shall include all reasonable expenses incurred by Landlord in obtaining or attempting to obtain a reduction of any such taxes, rates or assessments, including but not limited to legal fees, but shall not include any taxes on Tenant’s Personal Property or other tenants’ personal property, which taxes are the sole obligation of each tenant:</p>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, Tenant’s</p>

          <p id="s1p206">Medical payments (any one person) $ 5,000</p>
          <p id="s1p207">Said insurance shall name Landlord (in care of Landlord’s management agent and referring to the Building by its address), Landlord’s management agent and Mortgagee as an additional insured. The policy shall protect Landlord, Landlord’s management agent, and the Mortgagee against any liability for bodily injury, personal injury, death or property damage occurring upon, in or about the Premises, the Building or the Land or arising out of or relating to any risks against which Tenant is required to indemnify Landlord, Landlord’s management agent and the Mortgagee. From time to time during the Term, Landlord may require Tenant to increase said limits of said insurance to the limits of liability insurance then customarily required of tenants of other comparable office buildings in the city (or, if not a city, other local jurisdiction) in which the Building is located.</p>
          <p id="s1p208">B. Required Provisions of Policies: All insurance policies required to be maintained by Tenant under this Lease must: (i) be issued by insurance companies reasonably approved by Landlord; (ii) be in form and have content reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; (iii) be written as primary policy coverage and not contributing to or in excess of any coverage which Landlord or the Mortgagees may carry; (iv) contain an express waiver of any right of subrogation by the insurance company against Landlord, the Mortgagees and the Landlord’s and the Mortgagees’ employees and agents; and (v) provide that the policy may not be cancelled or permitted to lapse unless Landlord shall have received at least ten (10) days prior written notice of cancellation or non-renewal. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord (in care of Landlord’s management agent and referring to the Building by its address) an ACORD 27 Certificate of each such policy and any renewal policy, together with evidence of payment of all applicable premiums, at least ten (10) days before the Lease Commencement Date and at least thirty (30) days before the renewal of any policies. Any insurance required of Tenant under this Section may be carried under a blanket policy, provided that said policy shall specifically set forth the amount of insurance allocated to this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p209">C. Effect of Tenant’s Activities on Insurance: Tenant shall not conduct or permit to be conducted any activity, or place any equipment in or about the Land, the Building or the Premises which will increase the rate of, or make void or voidable, any fire or other insurance maintained or required to be maintained by Landlord or any Mortgagee on the Building, the Land or the property kept thereon or therein, which will conflict with the provisions of any such insurance policy or which will make it impracticable for Landlord to obtain insurance covering any risks against which Landlord reasonably deems it advisable to obtain insurance. In the event any increases in the rates of such insurance are, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, due to Tenant’s presence in the Building, to any activity conducted or property installed or placed by Tenant on or about the Land, the Building or the Premises or to Alterations installed by Tenant or at Tenant’s request, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the amount of</p>
          <p id="s1p210">13</p>
          <p id="s1p211">such increases promptly upon demand therefor. Statements by the applicable insurance company or insurance rating bureau that such increases are due to any activity, property or improvements shall be conclusive for the purposes of determining Tenant’s liability hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p212">D. Termination Right: Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days notice to Tenant in the event Landlord receives notice from any of Landlord’s insurance carriers that such carrier intends to cancel its insurance on the Building, or to increase the cost of such insurance by more than one hundred percent (100%) above the premium payable by Landlord immediately prior to such notice, due to the activities of Tenant or the presence of Tenant in the Building. However, Landlord shall not terminate this Lease in the event Landlord is able, with good faith efforts, to obtain equivalent insurance from an insurance carrier satisfactory to Landlord at a premium not more than one hundred percent (100%) greater than the premium for the cancelled insurance; provided that Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all additional premiums charged to Landlord by such new insurance carrier. It is expressly understood that Landlord shall not have the right to terminate this Lease pursuant to this Subsection D. if any cancellation or rate increase is due to factors generally applicable to the insurance or rental market, rather than to Tenant’s activities or presence in the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p213">E. Waiver: Except for gross negligence and intentional acts, Landlord and Tenant hereby each waive and release each other from any and all liabilities, claims and losses for which Landlord or Tenant is or may be held liable, to the extent either party: (i) receives insurance proceeds on account thereof, or (ii) is required to maintain insurance pursuant to this Section, whichever is greater.</p>
          <p id="s1p214">18. CONDEMNATION.</p>
          <p id="s1p215">A. Landlord’s Right to Terminate: If a substantial part of the Premises, the Building or the Land is taken or condemned by any governmental authority for any purpose or is granted to any authority in lieu of condemnation (collectively, a “taking”), Landlord shall have the right in its sole discretion to terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant, and upon the giving of such notice, the Term shall terminate as of the date title vests in the authority, and Rent shall be abated as of that date. For purposes of this Section, a substantial part of the Premises, the Land or the Building shall be considered to have been taken if, in the sole opinion of Landlord, the taking shall render it commercially undesirable for Landlord to permit this Lease to continue or to continue operating the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p216">B. Adjustment of Rent: If a portion of the Premises is taken and Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease pursuant to the preceding paragraph, then Rent shall be equitably adjusted as of the date title vests in the authority and this Lease shall otherwise continue in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p217">C. Division of Award: Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord arising out of or related to any taking, or for any portion of the amount that may be awarded as a result, and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all its rights, title and interest in and to any such award; provided, however, that Tenant may assert any claim it may have against the authority for compensation for Tenant’s Personal Property and for any relocation expenses compensable by statute, as long as such awards shall be made in addition to and stated separately from the award made for the Land, the Building and the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p218">19. DEFAULT.</p>
          <p id="s1p219">A. Default of Tenant: The following events shall be a default by Tenant (a “Default”) under this Lease:</p>
          <p id="s1p220">(1) Failure of Tenant to Pay Rent as and when due, if the failure continues for three (3) business days after notice from Landlord specifying the failure.</p>
          <p id="s1p221">(2) Failure of Tenant to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation of Tenant under this Lease, other than those concerning the payment of Rent, if the failure continues for twenty (20) days after notice from Landlord to Tenant</p>
          <p id="s1p222">14</p>
          <p id="s1p223">specifying the failure; provided, however, that if the failure on the part of Tenant is not capable of being cured within such 20-day period but Tenant expeditiously commences to cure same and diligently proceeds with such cure, Tenant’s time to cure such failure shall be extended for the time necessary to cure same, but in no event longer than ninety (90) days, inclusive of the original 20-day period.</p>
          <p id="s1p224">(3) If Tenant’s activities in the Premises results in a continuing or repeated, credible and significant threat of physical danger to other tenants and/or users of the Building, whether or not Tenant is capable of controlling such threat, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to Tenant in which Landlord describes in reasonable detail the nature of the continuing or repeated, credible and significant threat of physical danger or such shorter notice period as may be required to avoid cancellation of Landlord’s insurance or an increase in Landlord’s insurance premium; provided, however, that such termination shall be void and of no force or effect if Tenant ceases the threatening activities prior to the expiration of such notice period or such threatening activities otherwise cease.</p>
          <p id="s1p225">(4) If Tenant, any guarantor of Tenant’s performance hereunder (a “Guarantor”) or, if Tenant is a partnership, any partner of Tenant (“Partner”), shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent or shall file a petition or answer seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under any present or future federal, state or other law, or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall seek or acquiesce in the appointment of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant or of any Guarantor or Partner or of all or any part of the property of Tenant or of such Guarantor or Partner.</p>
          <p id="s1p226">(5) If, within thirty (30) days after the commencement of any proceeding against Tenant or a Guarantor or Partner, whether by the filing of a petition or otherwise, seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under any present or future applicable federal, state or other law, such proceeding shall not have been dismissed or if, within thirty (30) days after the appointment of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant or any Guarantor Or Partner, or of all or any part of the property of Tenant or of any Guarantor or Partner, without the acquiescence of such individual or entity, such appointment shall not have been vacated or otherwise discharged, or if any execution or attachment shall have been issued against the property of Tenant or of any Guarantor or Partner, pursuant to which the Premises shall be taken or occupied or attempted to be taken or occupied.</p>
          <p id="s1p227">(6) If Tenant fails to take possession of the Premises on the Lease Commencement Date or vacates, abandons or ceases to carry on its ordinary activities in the Premises prior to the Lease Expiration Date, with or without an intention of paying Rent; provided, however, that if (i) Tenant gives Landlord at least thirty (30) days prior written notice that it intends to vacate the Premises, (ii) Tenant pays the full amount of all Rent when due under this Lease while the Premises are vacant, (iii) the fact that the Premises is vacant does not adversely affect the Building or other tenants therein and does not result in any liability to, or expenditure of funds by, Landlord, and (iv) Tenant leaves the Premises in a condition satisfactory to Landlord and continues to maintain the Premises, in the condition required by this Lease throughout the remainder of the Term, then, and in such event only, Tenant shall not be deemed to be in Default under this Section 19.A.(6) and Landlord shall have the right, exercisable by sending written notice to Tenant, to sublet from Tenant for the balance of the Term of this Lease all of the Premises at Tenant’s then rental rate hereunder, or to terminate this Lease as to all or any portion of the Premises, which rights of Landlord as to subletting and termination shall be exercisable by Landlord in its sole discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p228">B. Remedies Upon Default: Upon the occurrence of a Default, Landlord shall have the right, then or at any time thereafter:</p>
          <p id="s1p229">(1) Without, demand or notice, to reenter and take possession of all or any part of the Premises, to expel Tenant and those claiming through Tenant and to remove any property therein, either by summary proceedings or by any other action at law, in equity or otherwise, with or without terminating this Lease, without being deemed guilty of trespass and without prejudice to any other remedies of Landlord for breach of this Lease, and/or</p>
          <p id="s1p230">15</p>
          <p id="s1p231">(2) To give Tenant written notice of Landlord’s intent to terminate this Lease, and on the date specified in Landlord’s notice, Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises shall cease and this Lease shall terminate.</p>
          <p id="s1p232">If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease, everything contained in this Lease on the part of Landlord to be done shall cease, without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover from Tenant all Rent, as set forth in Subsections C. and D. below. If Landlord elects to reenter pursuant to Subsection B.(1) above, Landlord may terminate this Lease, or, from time to time without terminating this Lease, may relet all or any part of the Premises as the agent of Tenant, for such term, at such rental and upon such other provisions as Landlord deems acceptable, with the right to make any alterations and repairs to the Premises that Landlord deems appropriate, at Tenant’s expense. No such reentry or taking of possession of the Premises shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease, unless notice of such intention is given pursuant to Subsection B.(2) above, or unless termination be decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction at the instance of Landlord. Landlord shall in no event be under any obligation to relet any part of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p233">C. Liability of Tenant: If Landlord terminates this Lease or reenters the Premises (with or without terminating this Lease), Tenant shall remain liable (in addition to all other liabilities of Tenant accrued at the time of the Default) for the sum of (i) any unpaid Rent accrued prior to the time of termination and/or reentry, as the case may be, plus interest thereon from the due date at the Default Rate, (ii) all Base Rent and Additional Rent provided for in this Lease from the time of termination and/or reentry, as the case may be, until the date this Lease would have expired had a Default not occurred, plus interest thereon from the due date at the Default Rate, (iii) any and all expenses (including but not limited to attorneys’ and brokerage fees) incurred by Landlord in reentering and repossessing the Premises, in correcting any default, in painting, altering or repairing the Premises in order to place the Premises in first-class rentable condition (whether or not the Premises are relet), in protecting and preserving the Premises and in reletting or attempting to relet the Premises, and (iv) any other amounts necessary to compensate Landlord for any other injury or detriment caused by the Default, minus the net proceeds (after deducting any rental abatements, tenant improvement allowances and other concessions and inducements) actually received by Landlord, if any, from any reletting to the extent attributable to the period prior to the date this Lease would have expired had a Default not occurred. Landlord shall have the option to recover any damages sustained by Landlord either at the time of reletting, if any, or in separate actions from time to time as said damages shall have been made more easily ascertainable by successive relettings or, at Landlord’s option, to defer any such recovery until the date this Lease would have expired in the absence of a Default, in which event Tenant hereby agrees that the cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued on the aforesaid date. The provisions of this Section shall be in addition to, and shall not prevent the enforcement of, any claim Landlord may have for anticipatory breach of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p234">D. Liquidated Damages: In addition to Landlord’s rights pursuant to Subsection C. above, if Landlord terminates this Lease, Landlord shall have the right at any time, at its sole option, to require Tenant to pay to Landlord on demand, as liquidated damages, the sum of (i) the total of the Base Rent, Additional Rent and all other sums which would have been payable under this Lease from the date of Landlord’s demand for liquidated damages (“Landlord’s Demand”) until the date this Lease would have terminated in the absence of the Default, discounted to present value at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum (the “Discount Rate”), (ii) all unpaid Rent accrued prior to the time of Landlord’s Demand, plus interest thereon from the due date at the Default Rate, (iii) any and all expenses (including but not limited to attorneys’ and brokerage fees) incurred by Landlord in reentering and repossessing the Premises, in correcting any default, in painting, altering or repairing the Premises in order to place the Premises in first-class rentable condition (whether or not the premises are relet), in protecting and preserving the Premises and in reletting or attempting to relet the Premises, and (iv) any other amounts necessary to compensate Landlord for any other injury or detriment caused by the Default; minus the sum of (a) the net fair market rental value of the Premises for the period referred to in Subsection D.(i) above, discounted to present value at the Discount Rate, and (b) any sums actually paid by Tenant to Landlord</p>
          <p id="s1p235">16</p>
          <p id="s1p236">pursuant to Subsection C. above; provided, however, that if said damages shall be limited by law to a lesser amount, Landlord shall be entitled to recover the maximum amount permitted by law. The “net fair market rental value” referred to in Subsection D.(a) above shall be the fair market rental value of the Premises at the time of Landlord’s Demand, reduced by any rental abatements, tenant improvement allowances and other concessions and inducements generally provided by landlords seeking to lease comparable commercial property in the area of the Premises at the time of Landlord’s Demand. If reletting is accomplished within a reasonable time after Lease termination, the “net fair market rental value” referred to in Subsection D.(a) above shall be deemed prima facie to be the net rental income (after deducting any rental abatements, tenant improvement allowances and other concessions and inducements) realized upon such reletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p237">E. Waiver: Tenant, on its own behalf and on behalf of all persons and entities claiming through Tenant, including but not limited to creditors of Tenant, hereby waives any and all rights and privileges which Tenant and such other persons and entities might otherwise have under any present or future law: (i) to redeem the Premises, (ii) to reenter or repossess the Premises, or (iii) to restore the operation of this Lease, with respect to any dispossession of Tenant by judgment or warrant of any court, any reentry by Landlord or any expiration or termination of this Lease, whether by operation of law or pursuant to the provisions of this Lease. Tenant hereby expressly waives receipt of a Notice to Quit.</p>
          <p id="s1p238">F. Lien on Personal Property: [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]</p>
          <p id="s1p239">G. Right of Distress: Landlord shall, to the extent permitted by law, have a right of distress for Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p240">H. Right of Landlord to Cure: If Tenant defaults in the making of any payment or in the doing of any act required to be made or done by Tenant under this Lease, then Landlord may, at its option, make such payment or do such act, and the expenses thereof, with interest thereon at the Default Rate, from the date paid by Landlord, shall constitute Additional Rent hereunder due and payable by Tenant with the next payment of Monthly Base Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p241">I. Attorneys’ Fees: In the event of any Default hereunder, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all attorneys’ fees incurred by Landlord in connection with such Default or the enforcement of Landlord’s rights or remedies arising in connection therewith, whether or not this Lease is terminated and whether or not Landlord institutes any lawsuit against Tenant as a result of such Default. In addition to the foregoing, whether or not this Lease is terminated, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all other costs incurred by Landlord with respect to any lawsuit instituted or action taken by Landlord to enforce the provisions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p242">J. Survival: Tenant’s liability pursuant to this Section 19 shall survive the termination of this Lease, the institution of summary proceedings and/or the issuance of a warrant thereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p243">20. NO WAIVER.</p>
          <p id="s1p244">No failure or delay by Landlord in enforcing its right to strict performance by Tenant of every provision of this Lease or in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, and no acceptance by Landlord of full or partial rent during the continuance of any Default, shall constitute a waiver of the provision or the Default, and no provision shall be waived or modified except by a written instrument executed by Landlord. No payment by Tenant, or receipt by Landlord, of a lesser amount than the full Rent shall be deemed to be other than a payment on account, notwithstanding any endorsement or statement on any check or letter accompanying any payment of any Rent. No waiver of any Default or settlement of any proceeding instituted on account of any claimed Default shall affect or alter this Lease or constitute a waiver of any of Landlord’s rights hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p245">21. HOLDING OVER.</p>
          <p id="s1p246">If Tenant shall be in possession of the Premises after termination of this Lease (whether by normal expiration of the Term or otherwise), at Landlord’s option: (i) Landlord may deem Tenant to be occupying the Premises as a tenant from month-to-month, (a) during the first thirty (30) days of such holdover occupancy at the sum of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Monthly</p>
          <p id="s1p247">17</p>
          <p id="s1p248">Base Rent in effect for the last full month of the Term, plus the monthly installments of Additional Rent which are then payable pursuant to Section 5.C. of this Lease, and (b) thereafter, at the sum of one hundred seventy-five percent (175%) of the Monthly Base Rent in effect for the last full month of the Term, plus the monthly installments of Additional Rent which are then payable pursuant to Section 5.C. of this Lease, and subject to all of the other provisions of this Lease, as applicable to a month-to-month tenancy, or (ii) Landlord may exercise any or all remedies for Default and at law and in equity, including but not limited to an action against Tenant for wrongfully holding over.</p>
          <p id="s1p249">22. SUBORDINATION.</p>
          <p id="s1p250">A. Lease Subordinate: This Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any and all Mortgages and to any Ground Leases, and any and all renewals, extensions, modifications, recastings and refinancings thereof. This clause shall be self-operative, without execution of any further instrument; but if requested by Landlord or any Mortgagee, Tenant shall promptly execute a certificate or other document evidencing and providing for such subordination. Landlord shall have the right to execute said document on behalf of Tenant if Tenant fails to do so within five (5) days after receipt of the request. Tenant agrees that, if any Mortgage is foreclosed or Ground Lease terminated, upon request by the purchaser at the foreclosure sale or Ground Lessor, as the case may be, Tenant shall attorn to and recognize the purchaser or Ground Lessor as the landlord under this Lease and shall make all payments required hereunder to such new landlord without any deduction or set-off of any kind whatsoever. Tenant waives the provisions of any law or regulation, now or hereafter in effect, which may give or purport to give Tenant any right to terminate or otherwise affect this Lease or the obligations of Tenant hereunder in the event that any such foreclosure, termination or other proceeding is filed, prosecuted or completed. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Mortgagee may at any time subordinate the lien of its Mortgage to the operation and effect of this Lease without Tenant’s consent, by giving Tenant written notice of such subordination, in which event this Lease shall be deemed to be senior to such Mortgage, and thereafter such Mortgagee shall have the same rights as it would have had if this Lease had been executed, delivered and recorded before said Mortgage.</p>
          <p id="s1p251">B. Modifications to Lease: In the event any of Landlord’s insurance carriers or any Mortgagee requests modifications to this Lease, Tenant shall execute a written amendment incorporating such requested modifications within thirty (30) days after the same has been submitted to Tenant by Landlord, provided that such modifications do not materially adversely affect Tenant’s use of the Premises as herein permitted or increase the rentals and other sums payable by Tenant hereunder. In the event Tenant refuses or fails to execute such amendment within thirty (30) days, Landlord shall have the right, at its sole option, in addition to Landlord’s other remedies for Default, to terminate and cancel this Lease by written notice to Tenant specifying the date on which this Lease will terminate. From and after said termination date, both Landlord and Tenant shall be relieved of any and all further obligations hereunder, except liabilities arising prior to the date of termination.</p>
          <p id="s1p252">23. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">A. No Transfer Without Consent: Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of Landlord in each instance (which consent may be withheld in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion) (i) assign, mortgage or otherwise encumber this Lease or any of its rights hereunder; (ii) sublet the Premises or any part thereof or permit the occupancy or use of the Premises or any part thereof by any persons or entities other than Tenant; or (iii) permit the assignment of this Lease or any of Tenant’s rights hereunder by operation of law. Any attempted assignment, mortgaging or encumbering of this Lease or any of Tenant’s rights hereunder and any attempted subletting or grant of a right to use or occupy all or a portion of the Premises in violation of the foregoing sentence shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord agrees that it shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent to a proposed subletting, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there shall</p>
          <p id="s1p254">18</p>
          <p id="s1p255">be no default at the time of the proposed subletting, (2) the proposed subtenant shall be creditworthy, (3) the proposed subtenant shall not be a governmental entity or a person or entity enjoying sovereign or diplomatic immunity, (4) the use of the Premises by the proposed subtenant shall not attract a volume, frequency or type of visitor or employee to the Building which is not consistent with the standards of a high-quality office building, (5) the proposed subtenant shall specifically covenant and agree to perform the obligations of Tenant hereunder and to occupy the Premises subject to the provisions of this Lease, and (6) Tenant remains liable for the faithful performance of this Lease. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to provide its consent or the denial of its consent to any proposed subtenancy within thirty (30) days following the date on which Landlord has received all of the following : (i) written notice of the name of the proposed subtenant, type of business entity and jurisdiction of formation, (ii) reasonably adequate financial information regarding such proposed subtenant; (iii) any other information related to the criteria set forth in the previous sentence, as reasonably requested by Landlord, and (iv) a true copy of the proposed sublease document in its final form.</p>
          <p id="s1p256">B. Take-Back Rights: In addition, Tenant may not assign this Lease, nor sublet (or permit occupancy or use of) the Premises, or any part thereof, without giving Landlord thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof. For thirty (30) days following receipt of said notice, Landlord shall have the right, exercisable by sending notice to Tenant, to sublet from Tenant (i) all of the Premises for the balance of the term of this Lease in the event Tenant notified Landlord of its desire to assign this Lease, or (ii) so much of the Premises as Tenant intends to sublet for the balance of the term of such sublease in the event Tenant notified Landlord of its desire to sublet the Premises or permit another to make use thereof, at the same rental Tenant is obligated to pay to Landlord hereunder. In the event Landlord does not exercise the aforesaid right within said thirty (30) days, Tenant may attempt to assign, sublet or permit use of this Lease or such space; provided that Tenant shall obtain the prior written consent of Landlord as set forth in Subsection A above. In the event that Tenant defaults hereunder, Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord the Rent due from any assignee or subtenant and hereby authorizes each such party to pay said Rent to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p257">C. Transfer of Stock: If Tenant and/or any Guarantor is a corporation, then the sale or transfer of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of Tenant’s shares (excepting shares transferred in the normal course of public trading). If Tenant and/or any Guarantor is a partnership, the sale or transfer of the partnership share, or any portion thereof, of any general partner shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p258">D. Expenses and Profits; Effect of Consent:</p>
          <p id="s1p259">(1) In the event Landlord permits Tenant to assign or sublet all or a portion of the Premises to a third party, fifty percent (50%) of any sums that are paid by such third party for the right to occupy the Premises, in excess of the Rent then in effect shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on a monthly basis as Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p260">(2) Tenant shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by Landlord in connection with any proposed or purported assignment or sublease and an administrative fee of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00).</p>
          <p id="s1p261">(3) The consent by Landlord to any assignment or subletting shall neither be construed as a waiver or release of Tenant from any covenant or obligation of Tenant under this Lease, nor as relieving Tenant from giving Landlord the aforesaid thirty (30) days notice of, or from obtaining the consent of Landlord to, any further assignment or subletting. The collection or acceptance of Rent from any such assignee or subtenant shall not constitute a waiver or release of Tenant from any covenant or obligation of Tenant under this Lease, except as expressly agreed by Landlord in writing.</p>
          <p id="s1p262">E. Permitted Assignments: Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph Section 23, Landlord agrees that if (i) no default is then continuing beyond any applicable cure period, (ii) no circumstance shall have occurred which with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both would constitute a Default by Tenant, (iii) Tenant or its permitted subtenant or assignee named herein shall be occupying the entire Premises and actively conducting business therein, and (iv) the net worth,</p>

          <p id="s1p340">35. SECURITY DEPOSIT.</p>
          <p id="s1p341">A. Amount and Uses: Landlord acknowledges receipt from Tenant of Eight Thousand Ten and 13/100 Dollars ($8,010.13) (the “Security Deposit”), to be held by Landlord as Security for the payment of all Rent payable by Tenant and for the faithful performance by Tenant of all other obligations of Tenant under this Lease. Said Security Deposit shall be repaid to Tenant after the termination of this Lease (or any renewal thereof), provided Tenant shall have made all such payments and performed all such obligations hereunder. Landlord shall not be required to maintain the Security Deposit in a separate account. The Security Deposit shall not be mortgaged, assigned, transferred or encumbered by Tenant without the prior written consent of Landlord, and any such act shall be void. Landlord may, at Landlord’s option, appropriate and apply the entire Security Deposit, or so much thereof as Landlord believes may be necessary, to compensate Landlord for the payment of any past-due Rent and for loss or damage sustained by Landlord due to any Default. In the event Landlord appropriates or applies the Security Deposit in such a manner, Tenant, within five (5) days after notice thereof, shall pay to Landlord an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the original sum deposited. Tenant’s failure to restore any such deficiency shall constitute a Default hereunder. In the event of bankruptcy or other debtor-creditor proceedings by or against Tenant, the Security Deposit shall be applied first to the payment of Rent due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.</p>
          <p id="s1p342">B. Transferability: In the event of a sale or transfer of Landlord’s interest in the Building or of the interest of any successor or assign of Landlord, Landlord (or such successor or assign) shall have the right to transfer the Security Deposit to any vendee or transferee and shall thereupon be released automatically from any liability therefor. Tenant shall look solely to the transferee for the return of the Security Deposit. No Mortgagee or purchaser of any or all of the Building at any foreclosure proceeding shall (regardless of whether the Lease is at the time subordinated to the lien of said Mortgage) be liable to Tenant or any other person for any of such Security Deposit, or any other payment made by Tenant hereunder, unless Landlord has actually delivered said deposit or other such sum to such Mortgagee or purchaser. In the event of any rightful and permitted assignment of Tenant’s interest in this Lease, the Security Deposit shall be deemed to be held by Landlord as a deposit made by the assignee, and Landlord shall have no liability to the assignor with respect to the return of the Security Deposit.</p>
          <p id="s1p343">36. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.</p>
          <p id="s1p344">A. Definition. As used ‘in this Lease, the term “Hazardous Material” means any flammable items, explosives, radioactive materials, hazardous or toxic substances, material or waste or related materials, including any substances defined as or included in the definition of “hazardous substances”, “hazardous wastes”, “infectious wastes”, “hazardous materials” or “toxic substances” now or subsequently regulated under any federal, state or local laws, regulations or ordinances including, without limitation, oil, petroleum-based products, paints, solvents, lead, cyanide, DDT, printing inks, acids, pesticides, ammonia compounds and other chemical products, asbestos, PCBs and similar compounds, and including any different products and materials which are subsequently found to have adverse effects on the environment or the health and safety of persons.</p>
          <p id="s1p345">B. General Prohibition. Tenant shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Material to be generated, produced, brought upon, used, stored, treated, discharged, released, spilled or disposed of on, in under or about the Premises, the Building, or the Land (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Property”) by Tenant, its affiliates, agents, employees, contractors, subtenants, assignees or invitees. Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all actions (including, without limitation, remedial or enforcement actions of any kind, administrative or judicial proceedings, and orders or judgments arising out of or resulting therefrom), costs, claims, damages (including without limitation, attorneys’, consultants’, and experts’ fees, court costs and amount paid in settlement of any claims or actions), fines, forfeitures or other civil, administrative or criminal penalties, injunctive or other relief (whether or not based upon personal injury, property damage, or</p>

          <p id="s1p348">C. Notice. In the event that Hazardous Materials are discovered upon, in, or under the Property, and any governmental agency or entity having jurisdiction over the Property requires the removal of such Hazardous Materials, Tenant shall be responsible for removing those Hazardous Materials arising out of or related to the use or occupancy of the Property by Tenant or its affiliates, agents, employees, contractors, subtenants, assignees or invitees but not those of its predecessors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not take any remedial action in or about the Property or any portion thereof without first notifying Landlord of Tenant’s intention to do so and affording Landlord the opportunity to protect Landlord’s interest with respect thereto. Tenant immediately shall notify Landlord in writing of: (i) any spill, release, discharge or disposal of any Hazardous Material in, on or under the Property or any portion thereof; (ii) any enforcement, cleanup, removal or other governmental or regulatory action instituted, contemplated, or threatened (if Tenant has notice thereof) pursuant to any laws respecting Hazardous Materials; (iii) any claim made or threatened by any person against Tenant or the Property or any portion thereof relating to damage, contribution, cost recovery, compensation, loss or injury resulting from or claimed to result from any Hazardous Materials; and (iv) any reports made to any governmental agency or entity arising out of or in connection with any Hazardous Materials in, on under or about or removed from the Property or any portion thereof, including any complaints, notices, warnings, reports or asserted violations in connection therewith.

          <p id="s1p349">D. Survival. The respective rights and obligations of Landlord and Tenant under this Section 36 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p350">37. RELOCATION OF TENANT.</p>
          <p id="s1p351">Landlord shall have the right, at any time during the Term and at its sole cost and expense, to relocate Tenant to other premises within the Building (the “Relocation Space”) provided: (1) the Relocation Space will be located on “river” side of the Building and will be similar to the Premises in area and usable for Tenant’s purpose; (2) Landlord furnishes the Relocation Space, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, with new improvements of comparable or better quality as those improvements provided by Landlord for the Premises; (3) Landlord pays all of Tenant’s out of pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Tenant and paid to professional movers and relocation specialists in physically packing and moving Tenant’s personal property and equipment (including, but not limited to, telephone, computers and other data transmission equipment, hook-ups and cabling) to the Relocation Space; (4) Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the cost of the replacement of any stationary located at the Premises as of the date of Landlord’s notice, if required, and (5) such move will be made during evenings, weekends or otherwise so as to incur the least inconvenience to Tenant. Landlord shall provide written notice to Tenant of the relocation to the Relocation Space not less than sixty (60) days prior to such relocation. Tenant agrees to execute, upon Landlord’s request, an amendment to this Lease documenting the change in location. All other terms and provisions of this Lease shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p352">In the event that Tenant fails or refuses to relocate to the Relocation Space at the end of the aforesaid 60-day period, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving ten (10) days’ written notice of termination to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p353">38. NO RECORDATION.</p>
          <p id="s1p354">Tenant shall not record or attempt to record this Lease or any memorandum hereof in any public records without the prior written approval of Landlord, which may be denied in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion. In the event that Landlord grants</p>
          <p id="s1p355">25</p>
          <p id="s1p356">its approval to record this Lease or a memorandum hereof, Tenant shall pay all recordation fees, taxes and charges in connection with such recordation.</p>
          <p id="s1p357">39. OPTION TO RENEW.</p>
          <p id="s1p358">Provided that GLOBALSECURE HOLDINGS LTD., a Delaware corporation (GSH), INC., a Delaware non-profit corporation (“GSH”) is not then in default and has not been in default more than twice during the Term, in each case both at the time of exercise of the Renewal Option, as hereinafter defined, and at the commencement of the Renewal Period, as hereinafter defined, and is then in occupancy of the Premises at the time of exercise of the Renewal Option, as hereinafter defined, and at the time of the commencement of the Renewal Period, as hereinafter defined, GSH shall have one (1) option (the “Renewal Option”) to extend the Term of the Lease for one (1) additional five (5) year period (the “Renewal Period”) after the expiration of the initial Term. The Renewal Option shall be exercisable only by written notice given by GSH to Landlord not later than nine (9) months, nor earlier than twelve (12) months, prior to the expiration of the initial Term. In the event that GSH does not timely exercise the Renewal Option, said Renewal Option shall be null and void and of no further force or effect, time being of the essence in the exercise of the Renewal Option and it being acknowledged and agreed by GSH that Landlord shall be entitled to rely on any failure by GSH to give written notice of its exercise of its Renewal Option by the date set forth herein for such exercise thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p359">All terms and conditions of this Lease shall be applicable during the Renewal Period except that the amount of Base Rent charged for the Renewal Period shall be the then “Prevailing Market Rent”, which shall be the rent for comparable office space in comparable buildings in the “West End” submarket of Washington, DC taking into account the Base Year and any concessions provided to Tenant. If within thirty (30) days following delivery of GSH’s notice, Landlord and GSH have not mutually agreed on the Prevailing Market Rent for the Renewal Period, then within ten (10) days after the expiration of such thirty-day period, each party shall give written notice to the other setting forth the name and address of a Broker (as hereinafter defined) selected by such party who has agreed to act in such capacity, to determine the Prevailing Market Rent. If either party shall fail to select a Broker as aforesaid, the Prevailing Market Rent shall be determined by the Broker selected by the other party. Each Broker shall thereupon independently make his determination of the Prevailing Market Rent within twenty (20) days after the appointment of the second Broker. If the two Brokers’ determinations are not the same, but the higher of such two values is not more than one hundred five percent (105%) of the lower of them, then the Prevailing Market Rent shall be deemed to be the average of the two values. If the higher of such two values is more than one hundred five percent (105%) of the lower of them, then the two Brokers shall jointly appoint a third Broker within ten (10) days after the second of the two determinations described above has been rendered. The third Broker shall independently make his determination of the Prevailing Market Rent within twenty (20) days after his appointment. The highest and the lowest determinations of value among the three Brokers shall be disregarded and the remaining determination shall be deemed to be the Prevailing Market Rent. Within thirty (30) days after the Prevailing Market Rent is determined as aforesaid, the parties shall execute an amendment to this Lease setting forth the new Rent to be paid for the Renewal Period.</p>
          <p id="s1p360">For the purposes of this Section 39, “Broker” shall mean a real estate broker licensed in the District of Columbia, who has been regularly engaged in such capacity in the business of commercial office leasing in Washington, DC for at least ten (10) years immediately preceding such person’s appointment hereunder. Each party shall pay for the cost of its Broker and one-half of the cost of the third Broker.</p>

          <p id="s1p362">40. CONDITION OF EFFECTIVENESS.</p>
          <p id="s1p363">Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that this Lease shall become effective only upon the full execution and implementation of a third-party lease termination agreement with the tenant currently occupying the Premises, the Embassy of Luxembourg, on or before the Lease Commencement Date. Failure of this condition to occur on or before May 15, 2004 shall render this Lease void and neither Landlord and Tenant nor shall have any liability to the other under this Lease.</p>
