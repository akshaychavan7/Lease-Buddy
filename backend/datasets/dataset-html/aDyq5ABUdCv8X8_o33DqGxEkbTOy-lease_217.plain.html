          <p id="s1p14">SECTION TWO</p>
          <p id="s1p15">TERM</p>
          <p id="s1p16">Lessor demises the above premises for a term commencing on the 1 st day of February, 2008, and terminating on the 31st day of December, 2017, or sooner, as provided herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p17">This Lease supersedes and terminates Leases relating to the Premises dated January 1, 2006, April 1, 2004 and June 1, 2002.</p>
          <p id="s1p18">SECTION THREE</p>
          <p id="s1p19">RENT</p>
          <p id="s1p20">The rent for the term of this lease shall be Eighty One Thousand Three Hundred Twenty Dollars ($81,320.00) per month, payable in equal monthly installments beginning on the 1 st day of February, 2008, and the 1st day of each month thereafter until the 31st day of December, 2017.</p>
          <p id="s1p21">Subject to the terms and provisions of this Section Three, it is the intent of the parties that the Lessee shall be fully responsible for all costs and expenses related to the</p>
          <p id="s1p22">occupancy of the premises including, but not limited to, taxes, insurance, assessments, utilities, repairs and maintenance. All taxes, charges, costs, and expenses that Lessee assumes or agrees to pay hereunder, together with all interest and penalties that may accrue thereon in the event of the failure of Lessee to pay those items, and all other damages, costs, expenses, and sums that Lessor may suffer or incur, or that may become due, by reason of any default of Lessee or failure by Lessee to comply with the terms and conditions of this lease shall be deemed to be additional rent, and, in the event of nonpayment, Lessor shall have all the rights and remedies as herein provided for failure to pay rent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties acknowledge and agree that Lessor shall be liable, at its sole cost and expense, for any costs and expenses related to the premises arising from any act, omission, negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor, and that Lessee shall have no liability therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p23">Lessee shall be solely responsible for all real estate taxes and assessments, and pay all personal property taxes assessed against the premises in a timely fashion. In no event shall taxes payable by Lessee hereunder include any federal, state and local income, franchise, capital stock, gift, estate succession, inheritance, sales, use, revenue or transfer tax (or any substitution therefor) that Lessor must pay in connection with the Premises, nor shall such taxes include any interest or penalties (or costs directly associated therewith) due for late payment of taxes by Lessor, nor any other tax, assessment, charge or levy (or any substitution therefor) against Lessor with respect to or because of the rent and other income derived by Lessor under this Lease, nor shall Lessee be deemed obligated to pay any personal property, corporation, payroll, excise, privilege or any other tax of similar nature (or any substitution therefor) which may be levied or assessed against Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p24">Lessee, at its expense, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to contest or review by legal, administrative or other proceedings the amount or validity of any such tax or assessment imposed against the Premises. If Lessee does not pay real estate taxes when due and contests such taxes, Lessee shall not be in default under this Lease for nonpayment of such taxes if Lessee posts bond from an admitted surety in the amount necessary to protect the Premises from the lien of the unpaid taxes. The amount of such bond shall be sufficient to pay the real estate taxes plus a reasonable estimate of the interest, costs, charges and penalties which may accrue if Lessee’s action is unsuccessful. The bond made shall be applied to the real estate taxes due, as determined at such proceedings (or upon Tenant’s earlier payment of taxes under protest or otherwise), with any excess being disbursed to Lessee. Lessor, at Lessee’s request, shall join in any such proceedings, but Lessor shall not be liable for any expenses in connection therewith. The proceedings referred to herein shall include, but shall not be limited to, appropriate appeal from any judgments, decrees or orders made in any such proceedings. In the event of any reduction, cancellation or discharge of such taxes or assessments as a result of such proceedings, and if Lessee had not already paid same, then Lessee will do so forthwith as they are finally levied, assessed or imposed. If there shall be any refund payable by the governmental authority with respect thereto, the party paying such amount shall be entitled to receive and retain same.</p>

Lessor shall deliver such payment to Lessee within thirty (30) days after Lessee completes such improvement and provides documentation of its expenditure. In the event the Lessee extends the lease under Section Twenty-five, the Lessor shall be reimbursed for the period of time the lease is extended as per above; also, if the Lessee exercises the purchase option, Lessor shall be reimbursed for the balance of what was paid.</p>

          <p id="s1p112">premises to be used or occupied by others, nor shall this lease be assigned or transferred by operation of law, without the prior consent in writing of Lessor in each instance, if this lease is assigned or transferred, or if all or any part of the demised premises is sublet or occupied by anybody other than Lessee, Lessor may, after default by Lessee, collect rent from the assignee, transferee, subtenant, or occupant, and apply the net amount collected to the rent reserved herein, but no such assignment, subletting, occupancy, or collection shall be deemed a waiver of any agreement or condition hereof, or the acceptance of the assignee, transferee, subtenant, or occupant as Lessee. Lessee shall continue to be liable hereunder in accordance with the terms and conditions of this lease and shall not be released from the performance of the terms and conditions hereof. The consent by Lessor to an assignment, mortgage, pledge, or transfer shall not be construed to relieve Lessee from obtaining the express written consent of Lessor to any future transfer of interest.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall have the right to assign this lease to any related entity or to any entity that acquires Lessee’s assets, business or interests or to any entity that acquires the stock or interests of a related entity of Lessee, regardless of the form of any such acquisition, without Lessor’s prior consent.</p>

          <p id="s1p115">OPTION TO RENEW</p>
          <p id="s1p116">Lessor grants to Lessee an option to renew this lease for two (2) additional 5-year periods after expiration of the term of this lease. The rental provided hereinabove shall be renegotiated based on the Fair Market Rental for the Premises (as defined below), however, all other terms and conditions of the renewal lease to be the same as those herein. To exercise this option, Lessee must give Lessor written notice of the intention to do so at least one hundred eighty (180) days before this lease expires. Lessor and Lessee shall have thirty (30) days after Lessor receives Lessee’s renewal notice in which to agree on the rental payable during the renewal period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the rental for the applicable renewal period be less than the rental in effect immediately prior to the commencement of the applicable renewal period (“Prior Rent ”).</p>
          <p id="s1p117">If Lessor and Lessee are unable to agree upon the Fair Market Rental for the applicable renewal period within such thirty (30) day period, then within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such thirty day (30) period, each party, by giving notice to the other party, shall appoint a real estate appraiser who is a current member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, with at least five (5) years of experience appraising building space comparable to the Premises in geographic area in which the Premises are located to determine the Fair Market Rent. “Fair Market Rent” and “Fair Market Rental” shall mean, as of the date of applicable renewal notice, the net monthly rent per square foot that a willing tenant would pay and a willing landlord of comparable property in the geographic area where the Premises are located would accept at arm’s length for comparable space in a comparable building or buildings, with comparable tenant improvements, in a comparable location, giving appropriate consideration to then-current months net rental rates per rentable square foot, the presence or absence of rent escalation clauses such as operating expense and tax pass-throughs, abatement provisions, length of lease term, size and location of premises being leased, tenant improvement allowances, if</p>
          <p id="s1p118">any, and other generally applicable terms and conditions of tenancy for a similar building or buildings. If the two (2) appraisers are unable to agree on the Fair Market Rent for the renewal period within twenty (20) days, they shall select a third appraiser meeting the qualifications stated in this Section within five (5) days after the last day the two (2) appraisers are given to set the Fair Market Rent for the applicable renewal period. The third appraiser, however selected, shall be a person who has not previously acted in any capacity for either party. Within twenty (20) days after the selection of the third appraiser, a majority of the appraisers shall set the Fair Market Rent of the applicable renewal period. If a majority of the appraisers is unable to set the Fair Market Rent within twenty (20) days the two (2) closest appraisals shall be added together and their total divided by two (2). The resulting quotient shall be the Fair Market Rent for the applicable renewal term. Each party shall be responsible for the costs, charges and fees of the appraiser appointed by that party and shall share equally in the costs of the third appraiser.</p>
          <p id="s1p119">SECTION TWENTY-FIVE</p>
          <p id="s1p120">SURRENDER OF POSSESSION</p>
          <p id="s1p121">Lessee shall, on the last day of the term, or on earlier termination and forfeiture of the lease, peaceably and quietly surrender and deliver the demised premises to Lessor free of subtenancies, including all buildings, additions, and improvements constructed or placed thereon by Lessee, except moveable trade fixtures, all in good condition and repair subject to reasonable wear and tear and Lessor’s repair obligations, if any.

          <p id="s1p124">1. In the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Lessee of any of the terms or conditions hereof, Lessor shall have the right of injunction to restrain Lessee and the right to invoke any remedy allowed by law or in equity, as if the specific remedies of indemnity or reimbursement were not provided herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">2. The rights and remedies given to Lessor in this lease are distinct, separate and cumulative, and no one of them, whether or not exercised by Lessor, shall be deemed to be in exclusion of any of the others herein, by law, or by equity provided.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">3. No receipt of money by Lessor from Lessee after default or cancellation of this lease in any lawful manner shall (a) reinstate, continue, or extend the term or affect any notice given to Lessee, (b) operate as a waiver of the right of Lessor to enforce the payment of rent and additional rent then due or falling due, or (c) operate as a waiver of the right of Lessor to recover possession of the demised premises by proper suit, action, proceeding, or other remedy. After (a) service of notice of termination and forfeiture as</p>
          <p id="s1p127">herein provided and the expiration of the time specified therein, (b) the commencement of any suit, action, proceeding, or other remedy, or (c) final order or judgment for possession of the demised premises, Lessor may demand, receive, and collect any monies due, without in any manner affecting such notice, order or judgment.

Lessor hereby grants to Lessee a continuing option, for the term of this lease, to purchase the Premises, subject to Paragraph 2 hereafter, which option may be exercised by Lessee, in its sole and absolute discretion, at anytime during the term of the Lease. If Lessee desires to exercise such option, Lessee shall provide Lessor with written notice of its intent to exercise such option (the “Option Notice”) not less than ninety (90) days prior to the proposed closing date, which date shall be set forth in the Option Notice. Upon Lessor’s receipt of such notice, Lessor and Lessee shall enter into a real estate sale contract for the sale of the Premises with a purchase price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Premises as determined in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">2. Right of First Refusal. Lessor hereby agrees that if Lessee does not exercise their option to purchase and a third party expresses interest in the Premises, that Lessee will have first right of refusal to purchase said property. In the event that the Lessor receives a third party offer to purchase the property, the Lessor shall provide the Lessee with a notice of the terms and conditions thereof. Lessee will have ten (10) days in which to match the Offer or the Lessor may proceed with the sale to the third party.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">3. Title. Within twenty (20) days after receipt of the Option Notice, Lessor shall deliver to Lessee an updated abstract of title and a title insurance commitment from a title company selected by Lessee (the “Title Company”) evidencing marketable title to the Premises. Lessee shall thereafter have ten (10) days from the date of receipt of such documentation to examine title and make objections thereto, if any, in writing. Lessor shall sue its best efforts to cure any title defects within thirty (30) days thereafter. If title is not marketable and cannot be made marketable by Lessor within such thirty (30) days period, Lessee shall not be obligated to purchase the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">4. Closing. The closing of this transaction contemplated hereby (the “Closing Date”) shall be held at the Title Company and occur ninety (90) days after Lessee’s delivery to Lessor of the Option Notice or such other date as the parties may agree.</p>

Fair Market Value shall mean the amount a willing buyer would be willing to pay to a willing Seller for the Premises in a sale by the seller without a broker to a buyer without a broker, each being under no compulsion to buy or sell. Fair Market Value, if Lessor and Lessee are not able to agree on the same within thirty (30) days after Lessor’s receipt of the Option Notice (the “Negotiation Period”), shall be determined pursuant to the procedures set forth below.</p>
          <p id="s1p137">Not more than twenty (20) days after the end of the Negotiation Period wherein Lessor and Lessee failed to agree as to the Fair Market Value of the Premises, the parties shall attempt to agree upon an appraiser. If the parties agree upon an appraiser, the appraiser so selected shall determine the Fair Market Value of the Premises within thirty (30) days after selection. If the parties fail to so agree upon the selection of one such appraiser within twenty (20) days after the end of such Negotiation Period, Lessor and Lessee shall each designate, within five (5) business days from the end of such twenty (20) day period, one appraiser to determine such Fair Market Value.

If two appraisers are so selected, then they shall independently determine the Fair Market Value of the Premises and complete and forward to Lessor and Lessee their separate appraisal reports within thirty (30) days after the expiration of such five (5) business day period. Any appraisal report not so forwarded within such time period shall be excluded. If only one such report is timely forwarded then the appraisal set forth therein shall be the Fair Market Value. If both reports are timely forwarded and the lower appraisal is not less than ninety percent (90%) of the higher appraisal, then the average of the two appraisals shall be the Fair Market Value. If the lower appraisal is less than ninety (90%) of the higher appraisal, then the two appraisers shall meet and select a third appraiser within ten (10) days after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period. In the event the two appraisers fail to select a third appraiser within such ten (10) day period, either party may obtain court appointment of such third appraiser. The third. appraiser shall independently determine the Fair Market Value of the Premises and promptly complete and forward its report to Lessor and Lessee. The average of the two appraisals closest in amount shall be the Fair Market Value.
