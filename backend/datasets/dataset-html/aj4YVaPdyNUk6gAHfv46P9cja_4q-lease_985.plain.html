The Committee is authorized to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in the manner and to the extent the Committee deems necessary or desirable. Any decision of the Committee in the interpretation and administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall lie within its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties concerned (including, but not limited to, Participants and their beneficiaries or successors). The Committee shall have the full power and authority to establish the terms and conditions of any Award consistent with the provisions of the Plan and to waive any such terms and conditions at any time (including, without limitation, accelerating or waiving any vesting conditions). The Committee shall require payment of any amount it may determine to be necessary to withhold for federal, state, local or other taxes as a result of the exercise, grant or vesting of an Award.

Awards granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by Award Agreements (which need not be identical) that provide additional terms and conditions associated with such Awards (including, without limitation, the effect of a Participant’s termination of Employment upon such Awards), as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and any such agreement, the provisions of the Plan shall prevail.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">8.</p>
          <p id="s1p84">Terms and Conditions of Options</p>
          <p id="s1p85">4</p>
          <p id="s1p86">Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the foregoing and the following terms and conditions and to such other terms and conditions, not inconsistent therewith, as the Committee shall determine:</p>
          <p id="s1p87">(a)</p>
          <p id="s1p88">Number of Shares. Each Award Agreement with respect to the Options shall specify the number of Shares that are subject to the Option and shall provide for the adjustment of such number in accordance with Section 11 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p89">(b)</p>
          <p id="s1p90">Option Price. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the Option Price under any Option on the date of grant and set forth the Option Price in the Award Agreement; provided that the Option Price per Share shall not be less than the greater of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant or the par value of a Share on the date of grant.</p>
          <p id="s1p91">(c)</p>
          <p id="s1p92">Exercisability. Options granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee, but in no event shall an Option be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted.</p>
          <p id="s1p93">(d)</p>
          <p id="s1p94">Exercise of Options. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in an Award Agreement, an Option may be exercised for all, or from time to time any part, of the Shares for which it is then exercisable. For purposes of Section 8 of the Plan, the exercise date of an Option shall be the later of the date a notice of exercise is received by the Company and, if applicable, the date payment is received by the Company pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) in the following sentence. The purchase price for the Shares as to which an Option is exercised shall be paid to the Company in full at the time of exercise at the election of the Participant (i) in cash or its equivalent (e.g., by check), (ii) to the extent permitted by the Committee, in Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee, (iii) partly in cash and, to the extent permitted by the Committee, partly in such Shares or (iv) if there is a public market for the Shares at such time, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares obtained upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Company an amount out of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased; provided, in each case, that such method results in the Shares being issued as fully paid under Bermuda law.</p>
          <p id="s1p95">(e)</p>
          <p id="s1p96">Shareholder Rights. No Participant shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares subject to an Option until the Participant has given written notice of exercise of the Option, paid in full for such Shares and, if applicable, has satisfied any other conditions imposed by the Committee pursuant to the Plan.</p>
          <p id="s1p97">9.</p>
          <p id="s1p98">Terms and Conditions of Share Appreciation Rights</p>
          <p id="s1p99">5</p>
          <p id="s1p100">(a)</p>
          <p id="s1p101">Grants. The Committee also may grant Share Appreciation Rights. Each Share Appreciation Right shall entitle a Participant upon exercise to an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Share over (B) the per Share exercise price of the Share Appreciation Right, times (ii) the number of Shares covered by the Share Appreciation Right. The Share Appreciation Rights shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, which shall specify the terms and conditions of such awards, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, including the number of Shares covered by the Share Appreciation Right, the exercise price of the Share Appreciation Right (which shall not be less than the greater of the Fair Market Value or par value of a Share on the date the Share Appreciation Right is granted), the period over which the Share Appreciation Right may be exercised and such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan. The Share Appreciation Right shall be settled in Shares, cash or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">(b)</p>
          <p id="s1p103">Exercise. For purposes of Section 9 of the Plan, the exercise date of a Share Appreciation Right shall be the later of the date a notice of exercise is received by the Company and, if applicable, the date payment is received by the Company pursuant to the following sentence. Payment shall be made to the Company at the time of exercise in cash or by such other method approved by the Committee, provided any such method results in the Shares being issued as fully paid under Bermuda law, all as shall be determined by the Committee. Share Appreciation Rights may be exercised from time to time upon actual receipt by the Company of written notice of exercise stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Share Appreciation Right is being exercised. No fractional Shares will be issued in payment for Share Appreciation Rights, but instead cash will be paid for a fraction or, if the Committee should so determine, the number of Shares will be rounded downward to the next whole Share.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">(c)</p>
          <p id="s1p105">Limitations. The Committee may impose, in its discretion, such conditions upon the exercisability or transferability of Share Appreciation Rights as it may deem fit.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">(d)</p>
          <p id="s1p107">Limited Share Appreciation Rights. The Committee may grant LSARs that are exercisable upon the occurrence of specified contingent events. Such LSARs may provide for a different method of determining appreciation, may specify that payment will be made only in cash and may provide that any related Awards are not exercisable while such LSARs are exercisable. Unless the context otherwise requires, whenever the term “Share Appreciation Right” is used in the Plan, such term shall include LSARs.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">10.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">Other Share-Based Awards</p>
          <p id="s1p110">The Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant or sell Awards of Shares, Awards of restricted Shares and Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are</p>
          <p id="s1p111">6</p>
          <p id="s1p112">otherwise based on the Fair Market Value of, Shares (“Other Share-Based Awards”). Such Other Share-Based Awards shall be in such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, the right to receive, or vest with respect to, one or more Shares (or the equivalent cash value of such Shares) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives. Other Share-Based Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other Awards granted under the Plan. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine to whom and when Other Share-Based Awards will be made, the number of Shares to be awarded under (or otherwise related to) such Other Share Based Awards; whether such Other Share-Based Awards shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares; and all other terms and conditions of such Awards (including, without limitation, the vesting provisions thereof and provisions ensuring that all Shares so awarded and issued shall be fully paid and non-assessable).</p>
          <p id="s1p113">11.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">Adjustments Upon Certain Events</p>
          <p id="s1p115">Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to all Awards granted under the Plan:</p>
          <p id="s1p116">(a)</p>
          <p id="s1p117">Generally. In the event of any change in the outstanding Shares after the Effective Date by reason of any Share dividend or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, spin-off, combination or transaction or exchange of Shares or other corporate exchange, or any distribution to shareholders of Shares other than regular cash dividends or any transaction similar to the foregoing, the Committee in its sole discretion and without liability to any person shall make such substitution or adjustment, as applicable, as it deems to be equitable, as to (i) the number or kind of Shares or other securities issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan or pursuant to outstanding Awards, (ii) the Option Price of any Option or exercise price of any Share Appreciation Right and/or (iii) any other affected terms of such Awards.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">(b)</p>
          <p id="s1p119">Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control after the Effective Date, the Committee is authorized (but not obligated) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of outstanding Awards, including without limitation the following (or any combination thereof): (i) continuation or assumption of such outstanding Awards under the Plan by the Company (if it is the surviving company or corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or its parent; (ii) substitution by the surviving company or corporation or its parent of awards with substantially the same terms for such outstanding Awards; (iii) accelerated exercisability, vesting and/or lapse of restrictions under all then outstanding Awards immediately prior to the occurrence of such event; (iv) upon written notice, provide that any outstanding Awards must be exercised, to the extent then exercisable, within fifteen days immediately prior to the scheduled consummation of the event, or such other period as determined by the Committee (in either case contingent upon the consummation of the event), and at the end of such period, such Awards shall terminate to the extent not so exercised within the relevant period; and (v) cancellation of all or any portion of outstanding Awards by cash payment of the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to such outstanding Awards or portion thereof being</p>
          <p id="s1p120">7</p>
          <p id="s1p121">canceled over the purchase price, if any, with respect to such Awards or portion thereof being canceled.</p>

          <p id="s1p123">No Right to Employment or Awards</p>
          <p id="s1p124">(a)</p>
          <p id="s1p125">The granting of an Award under the Plan shall impose no obligation on the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate to continue the Employment of a Participant and shall not lessen or affect any right that the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate may have to terminate the Employment of such Participant. No Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and conditions of Awards and the Committee’s determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant (whether or not such Participants are similarly situated).</p>
          <p id="s1p126">(b)</p>
          <p id="s1p127">The Participant acknowledges that he has no entitlement to any remedy whether of compensation or of any other type, in relation to awards, either vested or unvested, which are cancelled pursuant to the cancellation provisions of this Plan or any applicable Award Agreement, notwithstanding any finding by any court or tribunal or other forum that his employment was not terminated in accordance with local law.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">13.</p>
          <p id="s1p129">Successors and Assigns</p>
          <p id="s1p130">The Plan shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company and a Participant, including (as applicable and without limitation), the personal representatives of the Participant in the event of his death, the estate of such Participant, executor, administrator or trustee of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Participant’s creditors.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">14.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">Nontransferability of Awards</p>
          <p id="s1p133">Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, an Award shall not be transferable or assignable by the Participant except in the event of his death (subject to the applicable laws of descent and distribution) and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate. An award exercisable after the death of a Participant may be exercised by the legatees, personal representatives or distributees of the Participant. Any permitted transfer of the Awards to heirs or legatees of the Participant shall not be effective to bind the Company unless the Committee shall have been furnished with written notice thereof and a copy of such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and the acceptance by the transferee or transferees of the terms and conditions hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">15.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">Amendments or Termination</p>
          <p id="s1p136">The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof or any Award (or Award Agreement) thereunder at any time; provided that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made (i) without shareholder approval if such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory</p>
