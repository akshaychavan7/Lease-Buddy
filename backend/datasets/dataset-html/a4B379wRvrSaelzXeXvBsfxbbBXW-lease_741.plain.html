          <p id="s1p170">This Lease is entered into on the date set forth on the Summary Page, by and between Iowa State University Research Park Corporation, an Iowa 504A corporation (“Landlord”), and the Tenant set forth on the Summary Page (“Tenant”).</p>
          <p id="s1p171">1. PREMISES: Landlord hereby leases to Tenant certain premises at the Iowa State University Research Park (the “Research Park”) more particularly described on Attachment I attached hereto and incorporated herein (herein referred to as the “Demised Premises”). Lease of the Demised Premises is subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease. The Demised Premises contain that number of gross square feet (“gsf’) as set forth on the Summary Page. Whenever reference is made herein to Tenant’s pro rata share based upon square feet of the Demised Premises, this number shall define the square feet of the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p172">2. TERM:</p>
          <p id="s1p173">The term of the Lease shall start on the later of the Commencement Date set forth on the Summary Page or the time set forth in section 3B hereof and shall terminate on the Termination Date set forth on the Summary Page (the “Term”).</p>
          <p id="s1p174">3. CONDITION OF THE DEMISED PREMISES:</p>
          <p id="s1p175">A. Except as may be otherwise set forth in an attachment to this Lease, Landlord has made no representations as to the condition of the Demised Premises, or promises to alter, remodel or improve the Demised Premises. Tenant’s taking possession of the Demised Premises shall constitute Tenant’s acceptance of the Demised Premises and Tenant’s confirmation that the Demised Premises are in good and satisfactory condition.</p>
          <p id="s1p176">B. If the Demised Premises are not ready for occupancy on the date that this Lease is due to commence, Landlord shall not be in default hereunder nor shall the Lease be void or voidable and the Landlord shall not be liable for any loss or damage as a result of the delay. Tenant shall accept possession of the Demised Premises when Landlord is able to deliver possession. The term of this Lease shall then begin on the date of delivery of possession, but the end of the Lease term shall remain the same. Landlord hereby waives payment of rent covering any period prior to tendering of possession of the Demised Premises to Tenant due to Landlord’s inability to deliver such for occupancy. On the date the Term begins, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord a letter of acceptance of delivery of the Demised Premises and confirmation that the Demised Premises are in good and satisfactory condition.</p>
          <p id="s1p177">4. BASE RENT:</p>
          <p id="s1p178">Tenant shall pay Landlord annualized base rent (“Base Rent”) in equal monthly installments as set forth on the Summary Page (payable monthly in advance) commencing on the first day of the Lease Term and continuing thereafter. Base Rent expressed on a per gross square foot per annum basis is as set forth on the Summary Page, but in the event of any discrepancy, the annualized fixed Base Rent set forth therein shall control. All payments of Base Rent shall be without abatement, deduction or set-off of any kind, it being the intention of the parties that</p>
          <p id="s1p179">Tenant’s covenant to pay the Base Rent shall be independent of all other covenants contained in this Lease. Tenant shall pay all amounts due to Landlord hereunder when due, at the address of Landlord, or to such other entity or person as Landlord shall designate in writing. Tenant shall not be required to pay Landlord a security deposit under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p180">Base Rent shall increase as set forth on the Summary Page.</p>
          <p id="s1p181">Any payment from Tenant received more than thirty (30) days past due shall be subject to a late payment fee of five (5) percent of the amount of such payment, plus interest on the amount of such delinquent payment accruing from the due date at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum.</p>
          <p id="s1p182">5. OPERATING COSTS: In addition to the Base Rent Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent Tenant’s pro rata share of the common area expenses and other operating costs incurred by Landlord in operating the Building and appurtenant grounds in which the Demised Premises are located (hereinafter the “Operating Costs” or “Operating Rents”).</p>
          <p id="s1p183">A. Definition of Operating Costs. Operating Costs shall mean the aggregate amount paid by Landlord for: 1) real property taxes, including all taxes, assessments, special assessments, levies and government charges of any kind and nature whatever (collectively, “Taxes”) levied, assessed or payable against the Demised Premises, the Building and appurtenant grounds; 2) insurance (including complete pass-through of any additional premiums solely attributed to activities of Tenant at the Demised Premises); 3) janitorial and cleaning, including supplies for common areas; 4) landscape maintenance, including regular mowing of grass, trimming, weed removal and general landscaping of appurtenant grounds; 5) snow plowing; 6) common area utilities, including (without limitation) parking area lighting; 7) water, natural gas and sewer charges (if not separately metered); 8) parking lot maintenance and cleaning and 9) repair and maintenance of common areas including HVAC systems; 10) management and administration expenses; 11) charges payable by Landlord for maintenance of common areas in the entire Research Park; and 12) all other operating costs attributable to the Demised Premises, the Building or the Research Park.</p>
          <p id="s1p184">B. Allocation of Operating Costs. Operating Costs paid by Landlord shall be allocated among tenants of the Building. Tenant’s pro rata share of Operating Costs shall be equal to that percent which is the ratio of the number of gross square feet in the Demised Premises to the total number of gross square feet in the Building, which pro rata share is specified on the Summary Page. The total amount of Operating Costs paid by Landlord shall be multiplied by that percent and the product shall be Tenant’s pro rata share of Operating Costs. At the outset of this lease and until adjusted as provided herein, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Operating Rent the sum per gross square foot per annum set forth on the Summary Page.</p>
          <p id="s1p185">C. Payment of Operating Costs. Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent Tenants pro rata share of Operating Costs due hereunder in monthly installments as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p186">i. On or before October 1 of each lease year, Landlord shall estimate the amount of Operating Costs for the next twelve-month period. Each month on the first day of the month, Tenant shall pay Landlord one-twelfth (1/12) of the Tenants pro rata share of the estimated annual Operating Cost calculated by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p187">2</p>
          <p id="s1p188">ii. On or before October 1 of each year, Landlord shall prepare a statement of the actual Operating Costs for the Building for the twelve-month period ending on June 30th of such year.</p>
          <p id="s1p189">iii. Landlord shall provide a copy of the actual Operating Cost statement to Tenant along with a calculation of Tenant’s pro rata share of such actual Operating Costs.</p>
          <p id="s1p190">iv. If Tenant’s pro rata share of the estimated Operating Costs is less than or equal to the actual annual Operating Cost amount, then Tenant shall pay Landlord the difference, if any, between Tenant’s pro rata share of the actual amount of Operating Costs and the amount of estimated Operating Costs Tenant paid to Landlord during such year. Tenant shall pay such difference within thirty (30) days of Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s statement, regardless of whether the Lease has since terminated. If the amount of estimated Operating Costs paid by Tenant is greater than Tenant’s pro rata share of Landlord’s actual Operating Costs, then Tenant shall receive a credit for the excess amount which shall be (a) applied against Tenants monthly obligation to pay Operating Costs until such excess amount has been amortized in full or (b) refunded within thirty (30) days to Tenant if the Lease has expired or terminated, so long as Tenant is not otherwise in default of the Lease. Partial lease years shall be equitably adjusted.</p>
          <p id="s1p191">v. Tenant or its designated agents shall have the right at all reasonable times, but no more frequently than once a year, to have an independent audit made of the books of Landlord relating to Operating Costs. If an inspection should reveal that Tenant’s pro rata share of Operating Costs has been overstated, then Landlord shall immediately credit such overstatement against the next monthly Operating Costs payable by Tenant until such overstatement has been fully amortized, so long as Tenant is not otherwise in default of the Lease. If any overstatement of Operating Costs exists at the termination of this Lease, Landlord shall pay Tenant such amount within twenty (20) days of termination.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">6. USE:</p>
          <p id="s1p193">A.

Tenant may, without the consent of Landlord, but at its own cost and expense and in a good and workmanlike manner, erect such shelves, bins, machinery, hoods, laboratory benches, laboratory equipment and fixtures as it may deem advisable, so long as such comply with all regulations and do not alter the basic character of, or overload or damage, the Demised Premises, the Building or improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p229">B. All alterations, additions, and improvements erected by Tenant shall be Tenant’s property during the Term of this Lease. Prior to expiration of this Lease, Tenant shall remove all alterations, additions and improvements erected by Tenant and restore the Demised Premises to its original condition by the date of Lease termination or upon earlier vacating of the Demised Premises.

If any property which is required to be removed is not removed, then Landlord, in addition to all other rights or remedies may, at its election, deem that the property has been abandoned by Tenant to Landlord, but no such election shall relieve Tenant of the cost to remove the property or repair any damage.</p>
          <p id="s1p230">C. All removals and restoration to original condition shall be accomplished in a good and workmanlike manner so as not to damage the primary structure or structural quality of the Demised Premises or Building.</p>

          <p id="s1p238">E. Tenant shall meet with Landlord on the Demised Premises for a joint inspection of the Demised Premises within the thirty (30) day period prior to vacating. If Tenant fails to arrange for such joint inspection, Landlord’s inspection at or after Tenant’s vacating the Demised Premises shall conclusively determine Tenant’s responsibility for repairs and restoration.</p>

This Lease shall be binding on and for the benefit of Tenant’s assignees and transferees with the same effect as if they were mentioned in each instance where Tenant is referenced. Tenant shall promptly deliver to Landlord a true and complete copy of every assignment or sublease.</p>
          <p id="s1p242">B.

Such collections, if any, shall not be a novation or release of Tenant from any performance of Tenant’s obligations hereunder except so much of rent due as is so collected.</p>
          <p id="s1p243">15. FIRE AND CASUALTY.</p>
          <p id="s1p244">A. Landlord shall maintain standard fire and extended coverage insurance covering the Building (including the Demised Premises and Improvements) are a part in an amount of not less than eighty (80%) percent (or for such greater percentage as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of any co-insurance clauses of the policy) of the “replacement cost” thereof as such term is defined in the Replacement Cost Endorsement to be attached thereto.

If the Demised Premises have been destroyed, or damaged beyond usability, within thirty (30) days after such casualty loss, Landlord may terminate this Lease and the rent shall be abated during the unexpired portion of this Lease (effective upon the date of the occurrence of such damage or destruction). No</p>
          <p id="s1p246">8</p>
          <p id="s1p247">damages shall be payable upon such termination and the parties shall be released herefrom without further obligation to the other, except for payment previously due and owing from Tenant to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p248">C. If Landlord does not choose to terminate, Landlord shall repair or rebuild the Demised Premises and the rent payable hereunder during the period in which the Demised Premises are not tenantable shall be reduced to such extent as may be fair and reasonable under all the circumstances during such period of repair or rebuilding. At the completion of such repair or rebuilding, rent shall resume for the full amount herein set forth for the remainder of the Term of the Lease. Landlord shall not be responsible for replacement of Tenant’s trade fixtures, furniture, equipment or other items that were not part of the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p249">D. If holder of an instrument (defined at Section 22 herein) requires that the insurance proceeds be applied to pay off the indebtedness evidenced by that instrument, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease by delivering written notice of termination to Tenant within fifteen (15) days after such requirement is made by any such holder. In such event, all rights and obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, except for any payments previously due and owing from Tenant to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p250">E. Nothing in this Lease shall be construed so as to authorize or permit any insurer of Landlord or Tenant to be subrogated to any right of Landlord or Tenant against the other party arising under this Lease. Landlord and Tenant each hereby release the other to the extent of any perils to be insured against by either of the parties under the terms of this Lease, whether or not such insurance as actually been secured and to the extent of their respective insurance coverage for any loss or damage caused by any such casualty, even if such incidents shall be brought about by the fault or negligence of either party or persons for whose acts or negligence the other party is responsible. Landlord and Tenant shall each obtain appropriate waivers of subrogation from their respective insurance carriers giving effect to this paragraph.</p>
          <p id="s1p251">16. LIABILITY.</p>
          <p id="s1p252">A. Covenant Not to Sue. Tenant shall not commence an action, interpose a counterclaim, or implead Landlord for any injury to person or damage to property on or about the Demised Premises resulting from and/or caused in part or whole by: 1) the negligence, omission, or misconduct of Tenant, its directors, officers, agents, servants, contractors or employees, or of any other person entering upon the Demised Premises for Tenant’s purposes; or 2) Tenant’s failure to repair.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">B. Indemnification. Tenant shall at all times indemnify and hold harmless Landlord, its directors, officers, employees and agents, from any loss, liability, claims, suits, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) and damages (actual, punitive, special and consequential), arising out of any personal injury, death or property damage associated with the Demised Premises, and on the common areas associated with the Demised Premises if caused by Tenant and/or Tenant’s directors, officers, employees, agents and/or invitees. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless Landlord for personal injury or property damage caused by the gross negligence of Landlord.</p>

All such policies shall be procured by Tenant from responsible insurance companies licensed to do business in the State of Iowa and satisfactory to Landlord. Evidence of such insurance shall be provided to Landlord prior to the commencement date of this Lease and continuously thereafter prior to expiration of such insurance coverages.</p>
          <p id="s1p256">17. CONDEMNATION. In the event the Demised Premises, or any portion thereof, shall be taken by eminent domain or condemnation, meaning the taking by exercise of any governmental power, whether by legal proceedings or otherwise (or by private voluntary sale or transfer in lieu thereof while under threat of eminent domain or condemnation):</p>
          <p id="s1p257">A. The proceeds of such taking or purchase shall exclusively belong to Landlord and Tenant shall make no claim against Landlord or the governmental authority for damages for termination of the leasehold interests or interference with Tenant’s business. Tenant shall only be entitled to an award made specifically to Tenant for its equipment and fixtures and relocation expenses, if any.</p>
          <p id="s1p258">B. This Lease shall not terminate so long as Tenant can still carry on its business on the Demised Premises but rental shall abate in proportion to space taken as determined by the parties hereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p259">C. This Lease shall terminate if it is impossible (by reason of such taking or purchase) for Tenant to still carry on its business on the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p260">18. TERMINATION; HOLDING OVER. At the termination of this Lease, Tenant shall yield up immediate possession to Landlord, shall remove all of its goods and effects and shall deliver all keys to the Research Park and the Demised Premises to Landlord.

Such rental shall be computed on a daily basis for each day of the holdover period. No holding over by Tenant, without consent of Landlord, shall extend this Lease except</p>
          <p id="s1p261">10</p>
          <p id="s1p262">as otherwise expressly provided herein. This section may not be interpreted for any purpose as a consent by Landlord to any holdover by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p263">19. QUIET ENJOYMENT. Subject to all rights of mortgagees, as set forth in Section 22 herein, Landlord covenants that:</p>
          <p id="s1p264">A. Landlord has full right and authority to enter into this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p265">B. Tenant, upon paying rent as required, and performing its other obligations, shall peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Demised Premises for the Term without disturbance from Landlord subject to the terms of this Lease and to any instruments as provided in Section 23 below.</p>

          <p id="s1p267">A. Tenant’s failure to pay any installment of Base Rent or Operating Rent, or utilities or any other sums due to the Landlord required by this Lease when due, and such failure continues for a period of ten (10) days from the due date.</p>
          <p id="s1p268">B. Tenant becoming insolvent, making a transfer in fraud of creditors, or making an assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>
          <p id="s1p269">C. Tenant filing a petition under any bankruptcy law of the United States or any state, or Tenant being placed in bankruptcy proceedings or adjudged bankrupt or insolvent in proceedings filed against Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p270">D. Receiver or trustee or similar officer being appointed for all or substantially all of Tenant’s assets.</p>
          <p id="s1p271">E. Tenant vacating or abandoning the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p272">F. Tenant failing to comply with any other term, provision or covenant of this Lease and not curing such within ten (10) days after written notice thereof. However, if such Tenant Default is not curable within ten (10) days, Tenant must have commenced the curing of the Tenant Default within ten (10) days and must be making a good faith, diligent effort to cure said Tenant Default as soon as possible.</p>
          <p id="s1p273">21. LANDLORD’S REMEDIES. If during any lease year Tenant fails to pay more than one installment of Base Rent and/or Operating Rent when due, Landlord shall be entitled to interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum until all such delinquent installments, other than the first delinquent installment, are paid by Tenant. Tenant shall not be required to pay Landlord interest on the first delinquent installment of Base Rent and/or Operating Rent during any lease year. If Tenant defaults and fails to cure within the applicable notice period, Landlord may pursue any one or more of the following remedies:</p>
          <p id="s1p274">A. Terminate the Lease or terminate Tenant’s right to possession under the Lease. In such event, Tenant shall immediately surrender the Demised Premises to Landlord. If Tenant</p>
          <p id="s1p275">11</p>
          <p id="s1p276">fails to do so, Landlord may, without limiting any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearage in rent, peaceably enter upon and without force take possession of the Demised Premises and peaceably remove Tenant and any other person that may be occupying the Demised Premises without being liable for prosecution or any claim of damages therefrom. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord shall not breach the peace or use any force to enforce any of its rights under this Lease. In such event, Tenant awes to pay to Landlord on demand the amount of all loss and damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of such termination, including without limitation Landlord’s inability to relet the Demised Premises on terms satisfactory to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p277">B. In the event of a termination due to Tenant’s default and removal as set forth herein, Landlord may:</p>
          <p id="s1p278">i. relet the Demised Premises and receive rent therefor. Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand any deficiency between the aggregate rent due under this Lease and the reletting. If Landlord relets the Demised Premises at a greater rental, such excess shall be the sole property of Landlord, and Tenant hereby waives any claim to such relet excess rent; or</p>
          <p id="s1p279">ii. perform Tenant’s obligations under the terms of this Lease. Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord on demand for any expenses which Landlord incurs in fulfilling Tenant’s obligations with interest accruing on such amount at twelve percent (12%) per annum. Tenant for itself and on behalf of any and all persons claiming through it, hereby waives all right and privilege to redeem the Demised Premises for the remainder of the Term after it has been dispossessed or ejected; or</p>
          <p id="s1p280">iii. obtain a temporary or permanent injunction, without necessity of posting bond.</p>
          <p id="s1p281">C. Exercise of any of the remedies set forth herein, or otherwise provided by law or equity, shall not constitute a forfeiture or waiver of any rent or other payments due to Landlord, or of any damages accruing to Landlord but rather shall be cumulative; nor shall any act of Landlord hereunder be deemed an acceptance of surrender of the Demised Premises. Only a writing signed by Landlord shall constitute a valid acceptance of surrender of the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p282">D. Landlord’s acceptance of any rent or other payments hereunder after a default by Tenant shall not be deemed a waiver of such default unless Landlord so notifies Tenant in writing. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce a remedy shall not be a waiver of default or Landlord’s right to enforce any remedy with respect to that default or any later default. Tenant shall pay Landlord’s reasonable attorneys fees in the enforcement or defense of any of Landlord’s rights or remedies hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p283">E. To protect Landlord in the event Tenant defaults hereunder, Tenant hereby grants to Landlord a continuing security interest for all rent and other sums of money becoming due hereunder from Tenant, and upon all goods, fixtures, furniture and other personal property of Tenant which are or may be located on the premises and the proceeds thereof, none of which may be removed from the Demised Premises without Landlord’s consent so long as any rent or other sum from time to time owed to Landlord hereunder remains unpaid. Tenant shall, on its</p>
          <p id="s1p284">12</p>
          <p id="s1p285">receipt of a written request from Landlord, execute such financing statements, continuation statements and other security instruments as are necessary or desirable, in Landlord’s judgment, to perfect such security interest.</p>
          <p id="s1p286">22. MORTGAGE SUBORDINATION; ATTORNMENT. Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any mortgage(s), deeds of trust, mortgage modifications, extensions and additions (collectively, “Instruments”) now or at any time hereafter constituting a lien or charge upon the Research Park, the Demised Premises or any leasehold improvements. Tenant shall at any time hereafter and as often as requested to do so on demand execute any documents which may be required by any holder of an Instrument for the purpose of subjecting and subordinating this Lease to the lien of any such Instrument. However, as a condition to executing any subordination, Tenant shall receive from the holder of such Instrument a covenant that as long as Tenant is not in default on this Lease, the holder will not disturb Tenant’s leasehold interest in the Demised Premises. At the option of the holder or beneficiary of any encumbrance upon the Research Park or the Demised Premises, Tenant agrees that no foreclosure of such encumbrance, nor any proceedings against Landlord, shall by operation of law or otherwise, result in cancellation or termination of this Lease or the obligations of Tenant. Upon request, Tenant shall execute such instruments satisfactory to the holder, beneficiary or purchaser at a foreclosure proceeding whereby Tenant attorns to such successor-in-interest.</p>
          <p id="s1p287">23. NEW OWNER. If Landlord shall sell, assign, or convey its right, title and interest in the Demised Premises to another, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect; Tenant shall in all respects recognize the new owner as its Landlord under this Lease, paying all rents and complying with all terms of this Lease. In the event of the sale or transfer of the Demised Premises, or the Building, or the Research Park and the assignment of this Lease, Landlord shall be relieved of all liability for the covenants and obligations in or derived from this Lease, or arising out of any act, occurrence or omission relating to the Demised Premises or this Lease. The covenants, representations and obligations of Landlord shall be binding on Landlord only during the period that Landlord has an ownership interest in the Demised Premises.</p>
