          <p id="s1p36">2.1 Premises. The Landlord hereby leases to the Tenant and the Tenant hires and takes from the Landlord the premises (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Premises&quot;) located in the city of Melbourne, County of Brevard and State of Florida, shown on the Site Plan (Exhibit &quot;A&quot;) extending to the exterior faces of all exterior walls or to the line shown on the Site Plan where there is no wall or to the center line of those walls separating the Premises from other leased Premises in the Building, subject to and with the benefits of the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease, together with the appurtenances specifically granted in this Lease, but reserving to the Landlord (i) the use of (a) the exterior faces of all exterior walls, however, Landlord may not use the exterior walls for advertising or marketing purposes by placing signs or other advertising on the walls without the prior consent of Tenant, and (b) the roof; and (ii) the right to install, maintain, use, repair and replace pipes, ducts, conduits and wires through the Premises and serving the other parts of the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p37">For the purposes of this Lease, the Premises shall be conclusively deemed to consist of the number of square feet of Leased Area as set forth in Section 1.1 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p38">2.2 Term. The Term of this Lease shall commence on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the final fifteen (15) day notice (the &quot;Final Notice&quot;) given by the Landlord to the Tenant informing the Tenant that the improvements to the Premises as provided for in Section 3.1 hereof have been substantially completed, or (ii) the day the Tenant commences its operations in the Premises, and ending at noon at the end of the Lease Term, unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided. Landlord shall use all reasonable efforts to deliver possession of the Premises to the Tenant on or before the estimated date for delivery of the Premises as set forth in Section 1.1 hereof. However, if the Landlord cannot deliver possession of the Premises for reasons beyond his control on or before that date, this Lease shall not be void or voidable, nor shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom. When the commencement and expiration dates of the Lease Term have been determined, the Landlord and the Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver a written Addendum to this Lease in the form attached hereto as Exhibit &quot;C&quot; specifying the commencement and expiration dates of the Lease Term, that the Tenant is in possession of the premises and is paying the Fixed Minimum Rent and all other charges hereunder, and that the Tenant has no claims, defenses, set-offs or counter-claims against the Landlord (or, if so, specifying the nature and amount thereof). Such statement, when so executed, acknowledged and delivered, will be deemed to be incorporated in and become a part of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p39">If the premises are not ready for occupancy by the estimated date for delivery (September 30, 2004), Landlord shall have an additional sixty (60) days to complete the improvements (November 30, 2004). If said improvements are not completed by November 30, 2004, Tenant may, at its option, elect to cancel this Lease and receive a return of its deposit paid herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p40">2.3 Option to Renew. Tenant shall have and is hereby granted five (5) options to extend the term of this Lease for a period of three (3) years for each option period upon the same covenants and conditions as herein provided, with, the exception that the Base Rent (as defined in paragraph 1.1), Adjustment of Annual Minimum Rent (as defined in paragraph 4.4), and Additional Assessments (as defined in paragraph 4.5), shall be adjusted based on the adjustment of annual minimum rent as stated in Section 4.4 of this Lease. If Tenant shall elect to exercise such option, it must do so by giving Landlord written notice at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the initial term of the Lease and prior to the expiration of each three (3) year option period thereafter.</p>
          <p id="s1p41">3.CONSTRUCTION</p>
          <p id="s1p42">3.1 Construction of Leasehold Improvements. The Landlord shall, at its sole cost and expense, improve the Premises as set forth in Exhibit &quot;B&quot; (Landlord's Work). Any improvements to the premises other than those set forth in Exhibit &quot;B&quot; shall be constructed by the Landlord at the sole cost and expense of the Tenant (Tenant's Work).</p>
          <p id="s1p43">No later than five (5) working days after the execution of this Lease by the Tenant: (i) Tenant shall approve a preliminary Space Plan for the premises, in form acceptable to the Tenant and Landlord's Space Planner, drawn to a scale of one-quarter inch (1/4&quot;) equals one (1) foot, or (ii) Landlord and Tenant, or their representatives, shall meet together with Landlord's Space Planner for the purpose of preparing a preliminary Space Plan for the Premises. Within twenty (20) working days from Landlord's receipt of the preliminary Space Plan, Landlord shall prepare and furnish to Tenant an estimated cost of construction of Tenant's Work, including in the estimate separate entries for labor, material and a supervisory fee. No later than five (5) working days after submission of Landlord's estimate of construction cost to Tenant, as set forth above, Tenant shall either agree to the estimate and authorize Landlord to proceed with the Work or furnish to Landlord specific objections to the estimate.</p>
          <p id="s1p44">If Landlord and Tenant agree to Landlord's estimated construction cost for Tenant's Work and to a final Space Plan, Landlord and Tenant shall execute an Addendum to this Lease, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit &quot;D&quot;, incorporating into the Addendum the agreed-upon Space Plan for the Premises, and setting forth the agreed cost of construction.</p>
          <p id="s1p45">The agreed cost of construction of Tenant's Work shall be paid by Tenant and Landlord as set forth in Exhibit &quot;D&quot; hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p46">3.2 Ownership Improvements. All improvements to the Premises shall remain the property of the Landlord. In no event shall Tenant make any improvements or alterations to the Premises, including the installation and removal of permanent fixtures, without the prior written consent of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p47">4.RENT</p>
          <p id="s1p48">4.1 Payment. All Rent and other charges payable to the Landlord under any provision of this Lease shall be paid to the Landlord, or as the Landlord may otherwise designate, in lawful money of the United States at the address of the Landlord or at such other place as the Landlord in writing may designate, without any set-off or deduction whatsoever, and without any prior demand therefor. In addition to the payment of the Rent and other charges, the Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord, at the time of payment of such Rent and other charges, all sales, use or occupancy taxes payable by virtue of any of such payments. Rent for any period during the term hereof which is for less that one (1) month shall be prorated portion of the monthly installment.</p>
          <p id="s1p49">4.2 Annual Minimum Rent. The Tenant shall pay the Annual Minimum Rent, which is subject to adjustments as hereinafter set forth, in equal monthly installments in advance on the first day of each calendar month included in the Lease Term. The first monthly installment shall be paid on the signing of this Lease if not previously delivered. Tenant acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent or other sums due hereunder will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which would be extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to processing and accounting charges, the late charges which may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any Mortgage or Trust deed covering the premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p50">4.3 Late Rent Fees. In the event any installment of Rent or any sum due hereunder is not paid within five (5) days after such amount is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional Rent a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of each such installment or other sum, or Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month, whichever is greater. A sum of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) will be paid by Tenant to Landlord for each returned check, and Tenant shall pay a charge of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) for preparation of a demand for delinquent rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p51">4.4 Adjustment of Annual Minimum Rent. During the Initial Lease Term, the Annual Minimum Rent specified in Section 1.1 hereof (and the monthly installments thereof) will be adjusted annually on each anniversary date of the date of commencement of the Lease Term to increase the same by three percent (3%) from the prior year's Annual Minimum Rent. If Tenant exercises any renewal options, the Annual Minimum, Rent specified in Section 1.1 hereof (and the monthly installments thereof) will be adjusted for changes in the Consumer Price Index on each anniversary of the commencement date of the Lease Term. The term &quot;Index&quot; means the U.S. Consumer Price Index, All Items, for all Urban Consumers (1982-84=100), published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics or other governmental agency then publishing the Index. In the event the Price Index ceases to utilize the January 88 average of 100 as the basis of calculation, or if a substantial change is made in the term of number of items included in the Index, then the Index shall be adjusted to a figure that would have resulted had the change in the manner of computing the Index not been effected. In the event such Index (or successor or substitute index) is not available, a reliable governmental or other nonpartisan publication evaluating the information theretofore used to determine the Index shall be used. The term &quot;Base Number&quot; means most recently published Index Number immediately preceding the commencement date of the Lease Term. The term &quot;Current Number Applicable to a Lease Year&quot; means the most recently published Index Number preceding the first day of the Lease Year for which adjustment is made, if the latest Current Number Applicable to a Lease Year exceeds the Base Number, then the Annual Minimum Rent shall be increased to an amount which is the product obtained by multiplying the Annual Minimum Rent set fourth in Section 1.1 of this Lease by a fraction, the numerator of which fraction is the current Number Applicable to any Lease Year and the denominator of which fraction is the Base Number.</p>
          <p id="s1p52">Notwithstanding the foregoing during any renewal term, annual rental adjustments will not be less than three (3%) percent annually or more than five (5%) percent annually.</p>
          <p id="s1p53">4.5 Additional Assessments. It is understood that, in addition to the Annual Minimum Rent and Adjustment of Annual Minimum Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent its prorated share of all taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, operating charges, maintenance charges, and any other charges, costs and expenses which arise from the ownership, occupancy or use of the Parcel, or any part thereof, including the maintenance of air conditioning equipment, but excluding the maintenance of exterior walls, roof areas and the structural integrity of buildings located upon the Parcel, which maintenance shall be the responsibility of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p54">Tenant shall pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses (real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance). Common area maintenance shall be defined as maintenance, garbage collection, site lighting, property management. Landlord estimates operating expenses to be $2.65 per square foot per year or $1,675.24 per month. Tenant shall also be responsible to pay the Florida State sales tax. Tenant shall have a continuing right to review, copy, and audit all documents and information pertaining to operating expenses and real estate taxes for the Project/Building. The CAM, real estate taxes and building insurance shall be adjusted annually after the first year of occupancy based on actual cost.</p>
          <p id="s1p55">For the purposes of this Lease, the term &quot;Parcel&quot; shall mean the contiguous property set forth in Exhibit &quot;A&quot; together with all site improvements located or to be located thereon.</p>
          <p id="s1p56">The Tenant Agrees to pay the Additional Assessments, as set forth above, in monthly payments in advance during the Term of this Lease as may be estimated by the Landlord. At the end of each calendar year, the Landlord shall advise the Tenant of the Tenant's share of the Additional Assessments payable for such calendar year as computed based upon the cost thereof to the Landlord. If there shall have been an underpayment by the Tenant, the Tenant shall pay the difference within ten (10) days: if there shall have been an overpayment by the Tenant, the Tenant shall be given a credit towards the next due payment of its share of the Additional Assessment.</p>
          <p id="s1p57">At the end of each calendar year, the Tenant shall have the right to require Landlord to substantiate, by written itemization, Landlord's computation of Tenant's Additional Assessments. Landlord shall furnish such an itemization to Tenant within thirty (30) days from receipt of Tenants written request for itemization.</p>
          <p id="s1p58">4.6 Security Deposit. N/A</p>
          <p id="s1p59">Landlord and Tenant agree that Landlord's Leasing Agent shall be entitled to immediately endorse and cash Tenant's Rent Check accompanying this Lease. It is further agreed and understood that such action shall not guarantee acceptance of this Lease by Landlord, but in the event Landlord does not accept this Lease, the Deposit shall be refunded in full to Tenant.</p>

This charge shall be Additional Rent under the Lease. In the event that Tenant shall fail or refuse to pay any utility charges individually metered to Tenant, the Landlord may but shall not be obligated to, pay such charges, and Tenant shall reimburse the Landlord on demand. If Tenant uses water or produces refuse in excess of normal office/warehouse use, Landlord, in its discretion, may allocate Tenant the increased cost for such services as measured or estimated by Landlord, and Tenant shall pay Landlord, on demand, any increased cost so measured or estimated.</p>
          <p id="s1p62">6.INSURANCE</p>
          <p id="s1p63">6.1 Insurance to be Maintained by Tenant. Tenant shall maintain, at Tenant's expense, with companies acceptable to Landlord during the term of this Lease liability Insurance in the form of a Combined Single Limit Bodily Injury and Property Damage Insurance Policy insuring Landlord and Tenant against any liability arising out of the use, occupancy or maintenance of the Premises in an amount not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) per occurrence.

Tenant shall furnish Landlord with a certificate of all insurance policies required by this Lease evidencing the existence and amounts of such insurance with loss payable clauses satisfactory to Landlord prior to accepting occupancy of the Premises. Renewals of such policies shall be deposited with the Landlord prior to the expiration of the term of such coverage. If the Tenant fails to comply with such requirement, the Landlord may but shall not be obligated to, obtain such insurance and keep the same in effect, and Tenant shall pay Landlord the premium cost thereof upon demand.</p>

          <p id="s1p106">10.5 Landlord's Right to Cure Defaults.

          <p id="s1p107">10.6 Waiver.
