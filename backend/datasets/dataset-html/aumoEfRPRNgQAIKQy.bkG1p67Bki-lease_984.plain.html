          <p id="s1p574">10. Memoranda of reviewed rent</p>
          <p id="s1p575">(a) As soon as the amount of any reviewed rent has been agreed or determined a memorandum of such reviewed rent shall be prepared by the Landlord or its solicitors and shall be signed by or on behalf of the Landlord and the Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p576">(b) The Tenant shall be responsible for and shall pay to the Landlord the stamp duty (if any) payable on such memoranda and any counterparts, but the parties shall each bear their own costs in respect of the preparation and execution of such memoranda and any counterparts.</p>

          <p id="s1p633">4. The Landlord shall be entitled to provide any new or additional services if any such services shall in the reasonable opinion of the Landlord be for the benefit of the Building and any such additional services shall be deemed to be included in the list of the Services set out in this Schedule 5 as soon as the same are first provided.</p>

          <p id="s1p641">2. The amount of each Advance Payment shall be one quarter of such amount as the Landlord may reasonably determine to be equal to the amount of the Tenant’s Proportion of the Service Charge for the relevant Service Charge Period and which is notified by the Landlord or its agents to the Tenant on or before each anniversary of the Term Commencement Date or as soon as may be practicable thereafter.</p>
          <p id="s1p642">3. The Service Charge is to be treated as accruing on a day-to-day basis in order to ascertain yearly rates and for the purposes of apportionment in relation to periods other than of one year.</p>

The Landlord will as soon as may be practicable after the end of each Service Charge Period submit to the Tenant a statement duly certified (if so requested) by the Landlord’s accountant or surveyor giving a proper summary of the Service Charge for the Service Charge Period just ended.</p>
          <p id="s1p644">5. If the Tenant’s Proportion of the Service Charge as certified is more or less than the total of the Advance Payments (or the grossed-up equivalent of such payments if made for any period of less than the Service Charge Period), then any sum due to or payable by the Landlord by way of adjustment in respect of the Tenant’s Proportion of the Service Charge is forthwith to be paid or allowed as the case may be. The provisions of this paragraph are to continue to apply notwithstanding the determination or earlier termination of this Lease in respect of any Service Charge Period then current.</p>
          <p id="s1p645">6. The Tenant is entitled to:</p>
          <p id="s1p646">(a) inspect the Service Charge records and vouchers of the Landlord at such location as the Landlord may reasonably appoint for the purpose during normal working hours on weekdays upon giving the Landlord at least 14 (fourteen) days prior written notice of its intention to inspect such records and vouchers; and</p>
          <p id="s1p647">(b) at the Tenant’s expense take copies of such records and vouchers.</p>
          <p id="s1p648">7. If the Landlord is required during any Service Charge Period to incur heavy or exceptional expenditure which forms part of the Service Charge, the Landlord is to be entitled to recover from the Tenant the Tenant’s Proportion of the Service Charge representing the whole of that expenditure on the Instalment Day next following.</p>
          <p id="s1p649">8. The Tenant is not entitled to object to the Service Charge (or any item comprised in it) or otherwise on any of the following grounds:</p>
          <p id="s1p650">(a) the inclusion in a subsequent Service Charge Period of any item of expenditure or liability omitted from the Service Charge for any preceding Service Charge Period;</p>
          <p id="s1p651">41</p>
          <p id="s1p652">(b) an item of Service Charge included at a proper cost might have been provided or performed at a lower cost;</p>
          <p id="s1p653">(c) disagreement with any estimate of future expenditure for which the Landlord requires to make provision so long as the Landlord has acted reasonably and in good faith and in the absence of manifest error;</p>
          <p id="s1p654">(d) the manner in which the Landlord exercises its discretion in providing the Services so long as the Landlord acts in good faith and in accordance with the principles of good estate management;</p>
          <p id="s1p655">(e) the employment of managing agents or other persons to carry out and provide on the Landlord’s behalf any of the Landlord’s obligations under this Schedule 5;</p>
          <p id="s1p656">(f) on a permitted assignment of this Lease the Landlord:</p>
          <p id="s1p657">(i) shall not be required to make any apportionment relative to such an assignment; and</p>
          <p id="s1p658">(ii) shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the tenant in whom this Lease is for the time being vested (and, for this purpose, in disregard of a permitted assignment of this Lease which has not been delivered to the Landlord in accordance with clause 4.14(b)(ix)); and</p>
          <p id="s1p659">(g) the benefit of a service provided by the Landlord will be enjoyed substantially at a time after the expiry of this Lease if the service is provided by the Landlord in good faith and it is generally of benefit to the tenants of the Landlord in the Building as a class.</p>
          <p id="s1p660">9. The Tenant’s Proportion of the Service Charge may not be increased or altered by reason only that at any relevant time any part of the Building may be vacant or be occupied by the Landlord or that any tenant or occupier of another part of the Building may default in payment of, or be required to pay less than, its due proportion of the Service Charge attributable to that part.</p>
          <p id="s1p661">10. There is to be excluded from the items comprised in the Service Charge any liability or expense for which the Tenant or other tenants, licensees or occupiers of the Building may individually be responsible under the terms of their tenancy, licence or other arrangement by which they use or occupy the Building.</p>

          <p id="s1p695">In consideration of the payment by the Tenant of the sum of €10.00 (the receipt of which the Landlord hereby acknowledges) today and strictly on the basis that Hubspot Ireland Limited remains the Tenant under the Lease, the parties hereby agree that:</p>
          <p id="s1p696">1. Rent Free Period</p>
          <p id="s1p697">The Initial Rent shall be abated to nil for the following periods over the course of the first two years of the Term:</p>

          <p id="s1p699">1.2 first two months of year two.</p>

          <p id="s1p701">2. Break Option</p>
          <p id="s1p702">2.1 The Tenant may terminate the Lease on either 5 December 2015 or 5 December 2017 (either a “Break Date”) subject to serving a notice in writing on the Landlord exercising the right to terminate the Lease (the “Break Notice”) not less than six (6) months prior to the Break Date and in this regard time shall be of the essence.</p>
          <p id="s1p703">2.2 The Tenant shall continue to be responsible for the Initial Rent and all other payments which fall due for payment under the Lease up to and including the relevant Break Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p704">2.3 The Tenant shall on or prior to the Break Date deliver vacant possession of the Demised Premises to the Landlord together with the original of the Lease and all related title documentation (including a release or discharge of all mortgages, charges and other encumbrances affecting the Demised Premises, whether registered or not), and shall (if requested by the Landlord) as beneficial owner deliver duly executed and stamped a transfer or surrender of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p705">Page 1 of 3</p>
          <p id="s1p706">2.4 The Tenant shall take all steps as may be necessary to terminate, on or before the Break Date, all sub-leases (if any) that may have been permitted pursuant to the Lease and shall deliver to the Landlord on the Break Date vacant possession of the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p707">2.5 In the event that the Tenant exercises its option to terminate the Lease on 5 December 2015, it shall pay to the Landlord an amount equivalent to six months’ rent, service charge, insurances, rates and other outgoings payable under the Lease and shall deliver a bank draft in this amount to the Landlord on the Break Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p708">2.6 Any termination pursuant to this paragraph 2 shall be without prejudice to any right or remedy of either party in respect of any antecedent breach by the other party of any of their respective covenants contained in the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p709">3. Sub-leases at less than the Initial Rent</p>
          <p id="s1p710">Notwithstanding clause 4.14(b)(v) of the Lease, the Tenant shall be permitted to grant a sub-lease of the entire of the Demised Premises at an open market rent notwithstanding that this may be less than the passing rent under the Lease PROVIDED STRICTLY THAT the Tenant and any sub-tenant shall not use any such sub-lease, the rent payable thereunder or any of the terms of the sub-lease as evidence on any future rent review under the Lease and shall keep the terms of the sub-lease strictly private and confidential as between the Landlord, the Tenant and the sub-tenant, particularly so that it may not be used as evidence in any rent review of any premises within or adjoining the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p711">4. Service Charge Cap</p>
          <p id="s1p712">The Tenant’s Proportion of the Service Charge shall not exceed the sum of €44,792.50 (being €9.50 per square foot of the floor area of the Demised Premises) up to 5 December 2015. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tenant’s obligation to discharge the Service Charge shall be in accordance with the Lease as and from the first day of the fourth year of the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p713">The terms of this side letter are personal to Hubspot Ireland Limited and may not be assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of.</p>
