          <p id="s1p497">(i) Landlord shall within fifteen (15) days following the date on which Landlord receives an Option Exercise Notice select a surveyor and notify Tenant in writing of the name, address and qualifications of such surveyor. Within fifteen (15) days following Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s notice of the surveyor selected by Landlord, Tenant shall select a surveyor and notify Landlord of the name, address and qualifications of such surveyor. Such two surveyors shall endeavour to agree upon Fair Market Value based on a written appraisal made by each of them as of the date of the Option Exercise Notice. If such two surveyors shall agree upon a Fair Market Value, the amount of such Fair Market Value as so agreed shall be binding and conclusive upon Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p498">(ii) If such two surveyors shall be unable to agree upon a Fair Market Value within twenty (20) days after the selection of a surveyor by Tenant then such surveyors shall advise Landlord and Tenant of then respective determination of Fair Market Value, the two appraisers shall select a third surveyor to make the determination of Fair Market Value.

If the said Chairman shall, for any reason, not be available or shall be unable to make such appointment at the time of the application therefor, then the appointment may be made by the next senior officer of the Scottish RICS then available and able to make such appointment or, if no such officer of the Scottish RICS shall be so available and able, by such officer of such professional body of surveyors as the Landlord shall designate (and any reference to the Chairman shall be deemed to include a reference to such senior office holder or other officer). The determination of Fair Market Value made by the third surveyor appointed pursuant hereto shall be made within twenty (20) days after such appointment.</p>
          <p id="s1p500">(iv) If a third surveyor is selected, Fair Market Value shall be the average of the determination of Fair Market Value made by the third surveyor and the determination of Fair Market Value made by the surveyor (selected pursuant to clause 10.1(i) hereof) whose determination of Fair Market Value is nearest to that of the third surveyor. Such average shall be binding and conclusive upon Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p501">(v) All appraisers selected or appointed pursuant to this clause 10.1 shall (A) be independent qualified Scottish RICS surveyors (B) have no right, power or authority to alter or modify the provisions of this Lease, (C) utilize the definition of Fair Market Value set forth in clause 10.3, and (D) be registered in the Scottish RICS.

Other than pursuant to Preapproved Sublease, at no time during the Term shall subleases exist for more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross lettable area of the Buildings at the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          <p id="s1p716">2. If the Index shall be discontinued with no successor or comparable successor Index, the Landlord and the Tenant shall attempt to agree upon a substitute Index or formula, but if they are unable to so agree, then the matter shall be finally determined in the English language by an international accounting firm with offices in Scotland provided that if the Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on such firm, the Landlord and the Tenant shall have a coin toss and the winner of the coin toss shall make the selection of the accounting firm.
