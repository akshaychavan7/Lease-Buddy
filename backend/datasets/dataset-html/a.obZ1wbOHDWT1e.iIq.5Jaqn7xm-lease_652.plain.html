          <p id="s1p798">Subject to the terms and provisions set forth in this and provided (i) there has been no more than two (2) Events of Default by Tenant during the Term, (ii) Tenant is not in default beyond any applicable cure, grace or notice period at the time of exercise of the option hereunder permitted, and (iii) Tenant is then occupying the entire Premises leased to Tenant under this Amendment, as the same may be increased from time to time by agreement between the parties, Tenant shall have an on-going right of first refusal on any space within the Building which is or becomes vacant and available for lease (the Exhibit CROFR Space) exercisable upon receipt by Landlord and Landlords notice to Tenant (the ROFR Notice) of a bona fide third party offer (the ROFR Offer) to lease all or any part of such ROFR Space (the Available ROFR Space) when the same becomes available for lease on the terms set forth below.</p>
          <p id="s1p799">(a) Upon receipt of the ROFR Notice, Tenant shall have a period of ten (10) days from and including the date of delivery of the ROFR Notice in which to unconditionally and irrevocably exercise Tenants right to lease the Available ROFR Space pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ROFR Offer, failing which Landlord may lease the Available ROFR Space to any other party (the Prospect) on substantially the same material economic terms set forth in the ROFR Offer (Landlord shall not be obliged to lease the Available ROFR Space to the original offeror under the ROFR Offer), and if so leased, Tenant will have no further rights to the Available ROFR Space which is thereby fully released from this option. Tenant acknowledges that if Tenant counteroffers the ROFR Offer, or does not timely deliver Tenants unconditional and irrevocable acceptance of the ROFR Offer, then Landlord shall be at liberty at any time thereafter in its sole and absolute discretion (even if Landlord has commenced negotiations with Tenant) to determine that Tenant has waived its option to take the Available ROFR Space, and Landlord may thereupon lease the Available ROFR Space to a Prospect as aforesaid. Landlord must re-offer the Available ROFR Space to Tenant if, in Landlords subsequent negotiations or re-negotiations with the Prospect, the average Annual Rent per square foot is reduced by more than ten percent (10%), and/or if any available tenant improvement allowance is increased by more than ten percent (10%) per square foot. In the event of such material economic change, upon receipt of a written notice from Landlord with the terms of such re-offer (the Re-Offer), Tenant shall have a period of five (5) days from and including the date of delivery of the re-offer notice in which to exercise Tenants right to lease the Available ROFR Space pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Re-Offer, failing which Landlord shall be at liberty to lease the Available ROFR Space to a Prospect upon the terms and conditions of the Re-Offer. Time is of the essence herein. Tenant shall maintain strict confidentiality of the identity of Landlords lease prospects and Landlords market and other information (if any) provided to Tenant at Landlords discretion pursuant to this . In no event may Tenant elect to accept only a portion of the Available ROFR Space offered to Tenant under the ROFR Offer. Exhibit C</p>
          <p id="s1p800">(b) If Tenant exercises such option, then effective as of the date Landlord delivers the Available ROFR Space, the Available ROFR Space shall automatically be included within the Premises and subject to all the terms and conditions of the Lease, except as set forth in the ROFR Offer and as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p801">(i) Tenants Proportionate Share shall be recalculated, using the total square footage of the Premises, as increased by the Available ROFR Space.</p>
          <p id="s1p802">C-1</p>
          <p id="s1p803">(ii) Unless otherwise set forth in the ROFR Offer, the Available ROFR Space shall be leased on an AS-IS, WITH ALL FAULTS basis and Landlord shall have no obligation to grant Tenant any improvement allowance thereon or to improve the Available ROFR Space.</p>
          <p id="s1p804">(iii) Landlord will use reasonable diligence to make the Available ROFR Space available to Tenant on the date specified in the ROFR Offer. Landlord shall not be liable for the failure to give possession of the Available ROFR Space to Tenant on such date for any other reason beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, and such failure shall not impair the validity of the Lease, or extend the Term, but the rent for the Available ROFR Space shall be abated until possession is delivered to Tenant and such abatement shall constitute full settlement of all claims that Tenant might otherwise have against Landlord by reason of such failure to give possession of the Available ROFR Space to Tenant on the date originally identified by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p805">(iv) Within thirty (30) days of Tenants acceptance of the ROFR Offer and its compliance with the terms of this Exhibit C, Tenant shall execute an amendment to the Lease provided by Landlord confirming the inclusion of the Available ROFR Space, Tenants Proportionate Share, as revised, and the terms of the ROFR Offer including the Annual Rent and the Monthly Installment of Rent for the Available ROFR Space and the Lease Term for the Available ROFR Space; provided however that Landlords failure to prepare or Tenants failure to execute such amendment shall not affect the validity of the exercise of the option or the obligations of Tenant and Landlord with respect to the expanded Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p806">(c) This option is subordinate to all rights of renewal, extension, expansion, relocation or first offer or refusal rights as to the ROFR Space in favor of other tenants in the Building as of the date of this Amendment. Tenant acknowledges that this option is also subordinate to Landlords right to negotiate new leases with all tenants currently occupying ROFR Space pursuant to existing leases or agreements whether or not such leases or agreements contain rights of renewal, and Landlord shall not be required to deliver a ROFR Notice to Tenant before consummating any new lease between Landlord and such tenants or subtenants for ROFR Space, and Tenant may not exercise its option hereunder with respect to such ROFR Space.</p>
          <p id="s1p807">(d) This option and Tenants rights under this are personal to Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and cannot be exercised by any assignee or sublessee. Without limitation on any other provisions of this Exhibit C, this option shall terminate and be of no further force or effect if (i) Landlord terminates Tenants right to possession due to an Event of Default, (ii) Tenant is in occupation of less than the entire Premises leased to Tenant under this Amendment (21,100 square feet), (iii) Tenant ceases operating business from the Premises or vacates the Premises for in excess of thirty (30) days for reasons other than casualty or approved repairs, (iv) Tenant assigns or is deemed to have assigned its interest under the Lease, (v) there is less than seven (7) months remaining in the Term and Tenant has not exercised its renewal option, (vi) Tenant has delivered a Termination Notice to Landlord, or (vii) Landlord determines in its reasonable discretion that Tenants financial condition or credit worthiness has materially deteriorated since the date of this Amendment. Exhibit C</p>
          <p id="s1p808">(e) Notwithstanding anything hereinabove contained to the contrary and subject as stated in the next sentence, Tenant shall be required to lease approximately 5,458 square feet in the remainder of the Building as shown hatched and shaded on the plan attached at hereto (the Exhibit C-1Must-Take Space) upon the same economic terms as Suite 160, namely a co-terminous Lease Term (with a commencement date of August 1, 2010), the same rental rates as Suite 160, a 2010 Base Year, and an improvement allowance of $12.00 per square foot which shall be available for the Must-Take Space only (the Must-Take Space Allowance), with Tenant responsible for construction of improvements upon terms substantially comparable to those in attached to this Amendment except as otherwise Exhibit B</p>

Promptly upon receipt of possession of the Must-Take Space, Tenant shall procure, at Tenants cost, the construction of a demising wall to separate the Must-Take Space from the remainder of the space in which it is located, and the separation of utilities including installation of utility submeters, the cost of which work (including the cost of design plans and construction drawings relating thereto, permitting costs, and Landlords construction management fee) shall be deducted from the Must-Take Space Allowance. Landlords architect shall prepare any required construction drawings necessary for the separation of the Must-Take Space. Landlord in its sole discretion, may, at any time upon prior notice to Tenant, elect to complete such separation work itself, and all of the design, construction, and permitting costs including Landlords fee as aforesaid, shall be deducted from the Must-Take Space Allowance. If Landlord undertakes such work, then Tenant shall allow Landlords contractors unhindered access to the Must-Take Space for the purpose of completing the work. Tenant shall not occupy the Must-Take Space for the purpose of commencing operation of business therefrom without first obtaining a certificate of occupancy from the applicable municipality and providing a copy thereof to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p811">Notwithstanding anything hereinabove to the contrary, Tenants obligation to lease the Must-Take Space shall be conditional upon Landlord committing by no later than April 30, 2010 to provide interior multi-tenant corridor access, at Landlords cost, between the Must-Take Space and Tenants remaining Premises. If Landlord is:</p>
          <p id="s1p812">(i) unable to provide such commitment, then Tenants obligation under this subparagraph shall thereupon lapse and be of no further effect, but the Must-Take Space shall remain subject to Tenants right of first refusal option as otherwise set forth in this Exhibit; or</p>
          <p id="s1p813">(ii) able to provide such commitment, then Tenants lease of the Must-Take Space shall be confirmed by an amendment to the Lease to be executed by Tenant within thirty (30) days of its receipt thereof, confirming Landlords obligation to construct the interior multi-tenant corridor access, the inclusion of the Must-Take Space with the Premises, the coterminous Lease Term for the Must-Take Space commencing as of August 1, 2010, Tenants Proportionate Share as revised, the Annual Rent and the Monthly Installment of Rent for the Must-Take Space, the availability of additional parking spaces therefor, a work letter agreement as hereinabove described, and the Must-Take Space Allowance of $12.00 per square foot as aforesaid, provided however that Landlords failure to prepare or Tenants failure to execute such amendment shall not affect the obligations of Tenant and Landlord with respect to the Must-Take Space.</p>
          <p id="s1p814">Tenant acknowledges that Landlord can only provide such commitment if another tenant in the Building agrees to surrender some of its existing leased space which will be utilized for the multi-tenant corridor. The negotiation by Landlord of the surrender of leased space by such tenant shall be on terms acceptable to Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion. In no event shall Landlord be under any liability whatsoever to Tenant if Landlord fails to reach agreement with such tenant or at any time in its sole and absolute discretion elects to discontinue negotiations with such tenant.</p>
