In the event of termination, this Lease shall terminate as of, and rent shall be appropriately apportioned through and abated from and after, the first rental payment date occurring after the delivery of the notice of termination. In the event that neither Landlord nor Tenant exercises its option to terminate this Lease, then Landlord shall repair or restore such damage.

In the event of such a termination, this Lease shall terminate as of the date Tenant must surrender possession or, if later, the date Tenant actually surrenders possession, and the rent reserved shall be apportioned and paid to and as of such date.</p>
