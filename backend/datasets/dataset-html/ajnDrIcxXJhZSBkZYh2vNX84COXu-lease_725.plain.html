          <p id="s1p29">• For purposes of the foregoing, “Month 1” is the first full lease month after the Commencement Date. If the Commencement Date is not the first day of a month, then the first month shall be a partial month (prorated), and shall be added to the Lease Term. The monthly Total Rent for the partial month shall be Three Thousand Four Hundred Eighty Eight Dollars ($3,488) per day. Month 1 shall commence on the first day of the first full month of the Lease Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p30">• CAC charges to be adjusted per Common Area Charges Section below.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">Base rent and CAC as scheduled above shall be payable in advance on or before the first day of each calendar month during the Lease Term. The term “Rent,” as used herein, shall be deemed to be and to mean the base monthly rent and all other sums required to be paid by Lessee to Lessor pursuant to the terms of this Lease. Rent shall be paid in lawful money of the United States of America, without offset or deduction, and shall be paid to Lessor at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by Lessor. Rent for any period less than a calendar month shall be a pro rata portion of the monthly installment. Upon execution of this Lease, Lessee shall deposit with Lessor the first month’s rent, including estimated CAC and Security Deposit.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">1.7 Security Deposit: Lessee shall deposit with Lessor the sum of One Million Two Hundred Sixty Five Thousand Dollars ($1,265,000) (the “Security Deposit”). The Security Deposit shall be held by Lessor as security for the faithful performance by Lessee of all of the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease applicable to Lessee. The Security Deposit will be reduced to Six Hundred Thirty Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($632,500) when the Lessee achieves four consecutive quarters of net income and positive cash flow, excluding extraordinary items, as reported on their securities filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Security Deposit Reduction Event”). Following the Security Deposit Reduction Event if the Lessee reports two consecutive quarters of net loss and negative cash flow, excluding extraordinary items, as reported on their securities filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lessor will have the right to require the Lessee to increase the Security Deposit to One Million Two Hundred Sixty Five Thousand Dollars ($1,265,000) within fifteen (15) days after Lessor’s written notice to Lessee; provided, however, that upon any subsequent occurrence of a Security Deposit Reduction Event, the Security Deposit will again be reduced to Six Hundred Thirty Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($632,500) until such time, if any, as Lessee thereafter reports two consecutive quarters of net loss and negative cash flow, excluding extraordinary items, as reported on its securities filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lessor will again have the right to require the Lessee to increase the Security Deposit to One Million Two Hundred Sixty Five Thousand Dollars ($1,265,000) within fifteen (15) days after Lessor’s written notice to Lessee. If Lessee commits a default as provided for herein (after applicable notice and cure periods), including but not limited to a default with respect to the provisions contained herein relating to the condition of the Premises, Lessor may (but shall not be required to) use, apply or retain all or any part of the Security Deposit for the payment of any amount which Lessor may spend by reason of default by Lessee. If any portion of the Security Deposit is so used or applied, Lessee shall, within ten days after written demand therefor, deposit cash with Lessor in an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to itsimmediately prior amount. Lessee’s failure to do so shall be a default by Lessee. Any attempt by Lessee to transfer or encumber its interest in the Security Deposit shall be null and void.</p>
          <p id="s1p33">In lieu of the cash Security Deposit described above, Lessee shall have the right, at Lessee’s election, to provide the Security Deposit in the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit (the “Letter of Credit”) issued to Lessor, as beneficiary, by a U.S. bank reasonably approved by Lessor, in which case, the Letter of Credit shall serve as the Security Deposit under this Lease. Lessee shall maintain the Letter of Credit for the entire Lease Term, provided that Lessee may at any time substitute a cash Security Deposit for the Letter of Credit, and upon such substitution, Lessor shall return the Letter of Credit to Lessee. The Letter of Credit shall provide that it will be automatically renewed until thirty (30) days after the expiration date of the Lease Term or any extension thereof. If, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Letter of Credit, Lessee fails to furnish Lessor with a replacement Letter of Credit pursuant to this paragraph, Lessor shall have the right to draw the full amount of the Letter of Credit and shall hold the proceeds of the Letter of Credit as a cash Security Deposit pursuant to the foregoing paragraph. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, Lessor shall only draw upon the Letter of Credit following Lessee’s default (after applicable notice and cure periods) and only to the extent required to cure such default. If Lessor draws upon the Letter of Credit solely due to Lessee’s failure to renew the Letter of Credit at least thirty (30) days before its expiration (i) such failure to renew shall not constitute a default hereunder, and (ii) Lessee shall at any time thereafter be entitled to provide Lessor with a replacement Letter of Credit that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph, in which case Lessor shall immediately return the cash proceeds equal to the balance of the Letter of Credit drawn by Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">1.8 Common Area Charges: Lessee shall pay to Lessor, as additional Rent, an amount equal to Lessee’s pro-rata share of the total common area charges of the Premises as defined below (the common area charges for the Premises is referred to herein as (“CAC”)). Lessee shall pay to Lessor as Rent, on or before the first day of each calendar month during the Lease Term, subject to adjustment and reconciliation as provided hereinbelow, the sum of Two Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy One Dollars ($2,871), said sum representing Lessee’s estimated monthly payment of Lessee’s percentage share of CAC (which as of the date of this Lease represents the insurance covered under Sections 6 A) and 6 B) and the two percent (2%) management fee set forth in this Section). Lessee, at Lessee’s cost, will be responsible for replacement of capital items, including but not limited to: HVAC units, parking lot (not including resealing and restriping which is covered by the CAC), roof membrane replacement (not including the roof membrane maintenance which is covered by the CAC), roof decking, structural or insulation replacement as a result of water intrusion from failure of the roof membrane, elevator, and painting of building exterior (the “Capital Replacements”) during the Lease Term or any extension thereof by properly licensed and insured contractors using materials of equal or better quality that existed prior to the Capital Replacement. It is understood and agreed that Lessee’s obligation under this paragraph shall be prorated to reflect the Commencement Date and the end of the Lease Term, including a partial month.</p>
          <p id="s1p35">Lessee’s estimated monthly payment of CAC payable by Lessee during the calendar year in which the Lease commences is set forth above. At or prior to the commencement of each succeeding calendar year term (or as soon as practical thereafter), Lessor shall provide Lessee with Lessee’s estimated monthly payment for CAC which Lessee shall pay to Lessor as Rent. Within 120 days of the end of the calendar year and the end of the Lease Term, Lessor shall provide Lessee a statement of actual CAC incurred for the preceding year or other applicable period in the case of a termination year. If such statement shows that Lessee has paid less than its actual percentage, then Lessee shall pay to Lessor the amount of such deficiency within thirty (30) days. If such statement shows that Lessee has paid more than its actual percentage, then Lessor shall, at its option, promptly refund such excess to Lessee or credit the amount thereof to the Rent next becoming due from Lessee. Lessor reserves the right to revise any estimate of CAC if the actual or projected CAC show an increase or decrease in excess of 10% from an earlier estimate for the same period. In such event, Lessor shall provide a revised estimate to Lessee, together with an explanation of the reasons therefor, and Lessee shall revise its monthly payments accordingly. Lessor’s and Lessee’s obligation with respect to adjustments at the end of the Lease Term or earlier expiration of this Lease shall survive the Lease Term or earlier expiration. Lessee shall have the right, at any time within one hundred eighty (180) days after Lessee’s receipt of any such statement to audit Lessor’s books and records regarding CAC. If such audit shows that Lessee has paid less than its actual percentage of CAC, then Lessee shall pay to Lessor the amount of such deficiency within thirty (30) days. If such audit shows that Lessee has paid more than its actual percentage of CAC, then Lessor shall, at its option, promptly refund such excess to Lessee or credit the amount thereof to the Rent next becoming due from Lessee. In addition, if such audit shows that Lessee has overpaid CAC by more than ten percent (10%) of the CAC actually payable by Lessee, then Lessor shall pay the out of pocket cost of Lessee’s audit. Lessee’s audit shall take place at the Lessor’s business office where the records are kept at a date and time mutually agreed to by the parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p36">As used in this Lease, CAC shall include the reasonable costs actually incurred by Lessor for the following: (i) the repair and maintenance of the Premises under Section 5(b), the premiums for Lessor’s insurance under Sections 6 A) and 6 B) and the deductible thereunder (not to exceed $10,000 per occurrence), Taxes under Section 16, and the amount described in Section 31 for earthquake insurance; (ii) costs of supplies, materials, equipment and tools used and required in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Premises; (iii) licenses, permits and inspection fees; (iv) all other costs incurred by Lessor in directly maintaining and operating the Premises; and (v) costs to comply with government regulations imposed on the Premisesafter the Commencement Date and not related to Lessee’s particular use and occupancy of the Premises; and (vi) an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the base rent and CAC (to the extent that the Lessee elects to take direct control of the CAC as provided in Section 5(b), the management fee will only be calculated using the base rent and the CAC that is managed directly by Lessor), as compensation for Lessor’s accounting and management services. Lessee shall have the right to review the basis and computation analysis used to derive the CAC applicable to this Lease annually.</p>
          <p id="s1p37">1.9 Late Charges: Lessee hereby acknowledges that a late payment made by Lessee to Lessor of Rent and other sums due hereunder will cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges, and late charges, which may be imposed on Lessor according to the terms of any mortgage or trust deed covering the Premises. Accordingly, if any installment of base monthly rent or monthly estimate of CAC is not received by Lessor or Lessor’s designee within five (5) days after such amount is due (provided, however, that, on the first occasion in any calendar year that Lessee is delinquent in payment of base monthly rent or monthly estimate of CAC, Lessor shall give Lessee written notice thereof, and no late charge shall be payable so long as Lessee pays such past-due amount within three (3) days thereafter) or if any other Rent or other sum payable to Lessor is not received by Lessor or Lessor’s designee within ten (10) days after Lessor delivers a written notice to Lessee, Lessee shall pay to Lessor a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of such overdue amount. The parties hereby agree that such late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Lessor will incur by reason of late payments made by Lessee. Acceptance of such late charges by Lessor shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee’s default with respect to such overdue amount, nor shall it prevent Lessor from exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p38">1.10 Quiet Enjoyment: Lessor covenants and agrees with Lessee that upon Lessee paying Rent and performing its covenants and conditions under this Lease, Lessee shall and may peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises for the Lease Term, subject, however, to the rights reserved by Lessor hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p39">1.11 Possession: Possession shall be deemed tendered and the term shall commence on the date of this Lease or such other date agreed to by the parties in writing (the “Commencement Date”).</p>

          <p id="s1p41">2.1 Acceptance Of Premises And Covenants To Surrender: Lessee accepts the Premises in an “AS IS” condition and “AS IS” state of repair, subject to Lessor’s representation that the Premises are in good order and repair, and comply with all requirements for occupancy as of the Commencement Date. Lessee agrees on the last day of the Lease Term, or on the sooner termination of this Lease, to surrender the Premises to Lessor in Good Condition and Repair “Good Condition and Repair” shall generally mean that the Premises are in the condition that one would expect the Premises to be in, if throughout the Lease Term Lessee (i) uses and maintains the Premises in a commercially reasonable manner and in an accordance with the requirements of this Lease and (ii) makes all Required Replacements. “Required Replacements” are the replacements to worn-out (non-repairable) equipment, fixtures, and improvements, including the Captial Replacements that a commercially reasonable owner-user would make.

Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for all disposition costs incurred by Lessor relative to Lessee’s abandoned property. If the Premises are not surrendered at the end of the Lease Term or earlier termination of this Lease, Lessee shall indemnify Lessor against loss or liability resulting from any delay caused by Lessee in surrendering the Premises including, without limitation, any claims made by any succeeding Lessee founded on such delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p42">3.

Lessor consents to Lessee’s use of materials which are incidental to Lessee’s normal, day-to-day operations, but this does not relieve Lessee of any of its obligations not to contaminate the Premises and related real property or violate any Hazardous Materials Laws.</p>

Alterations And Additions: Lessee shall not make, or suffer to be made, any alteration or addition to said Premises, or any part thereof, without the express, advance written consent of Lessor; any addition or alteration to said Premises, except movable furniture, equipment and trade fixtures, shall become at once a part of the realty and belong to Lessor at the end of the Lease Term or earlier termination of this Lease.

Lessee agrees that it will not proceed to make such alterations or additions until all required government permits have been obtained and after having obtained consent from Lessor to do so, until five (5) days from the receipt of such consent, so that Lessor may post appropriate notices to avoid any liability to contractors or material suppliers for payment for Lessee’s improvements. Lessee shall at all times permit such notices to be posted and to remain posted until the completion of work. At the end of the Lease Term or earlier termination of this Lease, Lessee shall remove and shall be required to remove any additions or alterations installed by Lessee at or during the Lease Term and Lessee shall return the Premises to the condition that existed before the installation of the additions or alterations. Notwithstanding the above, Lessor agrees to allow any reasonable alterations and improvements and will notify Lessee at the time of approval if such improvements or alterations are to be removed at the end of the Lease Term or earlier termination of this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee may construct non-structural alterations and additions without Lessor’s prior approval, if the cost of any such project within a twelve month period does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) and does not alter the exterior appearance of the Premises or building.

          <p id="s1p65">C) Liability and Property Damage Insurance: Lessee, as a material part of the consideration to be rendered to Lessor, hereby waives all claims against Lessor and Lessor’s Agents for damages to goods, wares and merchandise, and all other personal property in, upon, or about the Premises, and for injuries to persons in, upon, or about the Premises, from any cause arising at any time, and Lessee will hold Lessor and Lessor’s Agents exempt and harmless from any damage or injury to any person, or to the goods, wares, and merchandise and all other personal property of any person, arising from the use or occupancy of the Premises by Lessee, or from the failure of Lessee to keep the Premises in Good Condition and Repair, as herein provided; provided, however, that the foregoing waiver and indemnity shall not apply with respect to any damage or injury caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor or Lessor’s Agents. Lessee shall, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, purchase and keep in force a standard policy of commercial general liability insurance and property damage policy covering the Premises and all related areas insuring the Lessee having a combined single limit for both bodily injury, death and property damage in an amount not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) per occurance of which Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) can be provided by a primary (or base) liability policy with an additional Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) provided by an excess or umbrella liability policy, and Lessee’s insurance shall be primary. The limits of said insurance shall not, however, limit the liability of Lessee hereunder. Lessee shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply with all of the insurance requirements of all local, municipal, state and federal authorities now in force, or which may hereafter be in force, pertaining to Lessee’s particular use and occupancy of the said Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p66">D) Personal Property Insurance: Lessee shall obtain, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, a policy of fire and extended coverage insurance including coverage for direct physical loss special form, and a sprinkler leakage endorsement insuring the personal property of Lessee. The proceeds from any personal property damage policy shall be payable to Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p67">All insurance policies required in 6 C) and 6 D) above shall: (i) provide for a certificate of insurance evidencing the insurance required herein, being deposited with Lessor on or prior to the Commencement Date, and upon each renewal, such certificates shall be provided 30 days prior to the expiration date of such coverage, (ii) be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and shall provide the coverage required by Lessee in this Lease, (iii) be carried with companies with a Best Rating of A minimum, (iv) specifically provide that such policies shall not be subject to cancellation, reduction of coverage, or other change except after 30 days prior written notice to Lessor, (v) with respect to insurance under 6 C) name Lessor, Lessor’s lender, and any other party with an insurable interest in the Premises as additional insureds by endorsement to policy, and (vi) shall be primary.</p>
          <p id="s1p68">Lessee agrees to pay to Lessor, as additional Rent, on demand, the full cost of the insurance polices referenced in 6 A) and 6 B) above as evidenced by insurance billings to Lessor which shall be included in the CAC. If Lessee does not occupy the entire Premises, the insurance premiums shall be allocated to the portion of the Premises occupied by Lessee on a pro-rata square footage or other equitable basis, as determined by Lessor. It is agreed that Lessee’s obligation under this paragraph shall be prorated to the reflect the Commencement Date and the end of the Lease Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p69">Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Lessor and Lessee hereby waive any rights each may have against the other related to any loss or damage to Premises caused by Lessor or Lessee as the case may be, or to the Premises or its contents, and which may arise from any risk covered by “all risk” property insurance or those risks required to be covered under Lessee’s personal property insurance. The parties shall provide that their respective insurance policies insuring the property or the personal property include a waiver of any right of subrogation which said insurance company may have against Lessor or Lessee, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p70">7. Abandonment: Lessee shall not abandon the Premises at any time during the Lease Term; and if Lessee shall abandon or surrender said Premises, or be dispossessed by process of law, or otherwise, any personal property belonging to Lessee and left on the Premises shall be deemed to be abandoned, at the option of Lessor. Notwithstanding the above, the Premises shall not be considered abandoned if Lessee maintains the Premises in Good Condition and Repair, provides security and is not in default.</p>
          <p id="s1p71">8. Free From Liens: Lessee shall keep the subject Premises and the property in which the subject Premises are situated, free from any and all liens including but not limited to liens arising out of any work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by Lessee. However, the Lessor shall allow Lessee to contest a lien claim, so long as the claim is discharged prior to any foreclosure proceeding being initiated against the property and provided Lessee provides Lessor a bond if the lien exceeds $5,000.</p>
          <p id="s1p72">9. Compliance With Governmental Regulations: Lessee shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply with all of the requirements of all local, municipal, state and federal authorities now in force, or which may hereafter be in force, pertaining to Lessee’s particular use of the Premises, and shall faithfully observe in the use and occupancy of the Premises all such local and municipal ordinances and state and federal statutes now in force or which may hereafter be in force.</p>
          <p id="s1p73">10. Intentionally Omitted.</p>
          <p id="s1p74">11. Advertisements And Signs: Lessee shall not place or permit to be placed, in, upon or about the Premises any unusual or extraordinary signs, or any signs not approved by the city, local, state, federal or other applicable governing authority. Lessee shall not place, or permit to be placed upon the Premises, any signs, advertisements or notices without the written consent of the Lessor, and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. A sign so placed on the Premises shall be so placed upon the understanding and agreement that Lessee will remove same at the end of the Lease Term or earlier termination of this Lease and repair any damage or injury to the Premises caused thereby, and if not so removed by Lessee, then Lessor may have the same removed at Lessee’s expense. Lessee shall, however, have the right to maintain, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, during the Lease Term or any extension thereof, all signageat the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p75">12. Utilities: Lessee shall pay for all water, gas, heat, light, power, telephone and other utilities supplied to the Premises. Any charges for sewer usage, PG&amp;E and telephone site service or related fees shall be the obligation of Lessee and paid for by Lessee. If any such services are not separately metered to Lessee, Lessee shall pay a reasonable proportion of all charges which are jointly metered, the determination to be made by Lessor acting reasonably and on any equitable basis. Lessor and Lessee agree that Lessor shall not be liable to Lessee for any disruption of the utility service to the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p76">13. Attorney’s Fees: In case suit should be brought for the possession of the Premises, for the recovery of any sum due hereunder, because of the breach of any other covenant herein, or to enforce, protect, or establish any term, conditions, or covenant of this Lease or the right of either party hereunder, the losing party shall pay to the Prevailing Party reasonable attorney’s fees which shall be deemed to have accrued on the commencement of such action and shall be enforceable whether or not such action is prosecuted to judgment. The term “Prevailing Party” shall mean the party that received substantially the relief requested, whether by settlement, dismissal, summary judgment, judgment, or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p77">14. Default</p>
          <p id="s1p78">14.1 Lessee Default: The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a default and breach of this Lease by Lessee: a) Any failure by Lessee to pay Rent or to make any other payment due to Lessor under this Lease which failure has not been remedied within three (3) days after Lessor shall have given Lessee written notice thereof; b) The abandonment of the Premises by Lessee except as provided in Section 7; c) A failure by Lessee to observe and perform any other provision of this Lease to be observed or performed by Lessee, where such failure continues for thirty days after written notice thereof by Lessor to Lessee; provided, however, that if the nature of such default is such that the same cannot be reasonably cured within such thirty (30) day period, Lessee shall not be deemed to be in default if Lessee shall, within such period, commence such cure and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion; d) The making by Lessee of any general assignment for the benefit of creditors; the filing by or against Lessee of a petition to have Lessee adjudged a bankrupt or of a petition for reorganization or arrangement under any law relating to bankruptcy; e) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of Lessee’s assets or Lessee’s interest in this Lease, or the attachment, execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Lessee’s assets located at the Premises or of Lessee’s interest in this Lease; and in the case of any involuntary event described in the foregoing clauses d) and e), the same shall not have been dismissed within sixty (60) days of the filing of any involuntary event.</p>
          <p id="s1p79">14.2 Surrender Of Lease: In the event of any such default by Lessee, then in addition to any other remedies available to Lessor at law or in equity, Lessor shall have the immediate option to terminate this Lease before the end of the Lease Term and all rights of Lessee hereunder, by giving written notice of such intention to terminate. In the event that Lessor terminates this Lease due to a default of Lessee, then Lessor may recover from Lessee: a) the worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of such termination; plus b) the worth at the time of award of unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeding the amount of such rental loss that the Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus c) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Lease Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus d) any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by Lessee’s failure to perform his obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom; and e) at Lessor’s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by applicable California law. As used in (a) and (b) above, the “worth at the time of award” is computed by allowing interest at the rate of Wells Fargo’s prime rate plus two percent (2%) per annum. As used in (c) above, the “worth at the time of award” is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%).</p>
          <p id="s1p80">14.3 Right of Entry and Removal: In the event of any such default by Lessee, Lessor shall also have the right, after issuance of a court order, by operation of the law or terminating this Lease, to re-enter the Premises and remove all persons and property from the Premises; such property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p81">14.4 Abandonment: In the event of the abandonment, except as provided in Section 7, of the Premises by Lessee or in the event that Lessor shall elect to re-enter as provided in Section 14.3 above, and Lessor does not elect to terminate this Lease as provided in Section 14.2 above, then Lessor may from time to time, without terminating this Lease, recover all Rent as it becomes due.</p>
          <p id="s1p82">14.5 No Implied Termination: No re-entry or exercise of remedies by Lessor pursuant to Section 14.3 or Section 14.4 of this Lease shall be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such intention is given to Lessee or unless the termination thereof is decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">15. Surrender Of Lease: The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Lessee, or a mutual cancellation thereof, shall not work a merger, and shall, at the option of Lessor, terminate all or any existing subleases or sub tenancies, or may, at the option of Lessor, operate as an assignment to him of any or all such subleases or sub tenancies.</p>
          <p id="s1p84">16. Taxes: Lessee shall pay and discharge punctually and prior to delinquency with penalty, all real estate taxes, personal property taxes, taxes based on vehicles utilizing parking areas in the Premises, taxes computed or based on rental income (other than federal, state and municipal net income taxes), environmental surcharges, privilege taxes, excise taxes, business and occupation taxes, school fees or surcharges, gross receipts taxes, sales and/or use taxes, employee taxes, occupational license taxes, water and sewer taxes, assessments (including, but not limited to, assessments for public improvements or benefit), assessments for local improvement and maintenance districts, and all other governmental impositions and charges of every kind and nature whatsoever, regardless of whether now customary or within the contemplation of the parties hereto and regardless of whether resulting from increased rate and/or valuation, or whether extraordinary or ordinary, general or special, unforeseen or foreseen, or similar or dissimilar to any of the foregoing (all of the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called “Tax” or “Taxes”) which, at any time during the Lease Term, shall be applicable against the Premises, or shall become due and payable and a lien or charge upon the Premises under or by virtue of any present or future laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations, or other requirements of any governmental authority whatsoever. The term “Environmental Surcharge” shall include any and all expenses, taxes, charges or penalties imposed by the Federal Department of Energy, Federal Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Clean Air Act, or any regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other local, state or federal governmental agency or entity now or hereafter vested with the power to impose taxes, assessments or other types of surcharges as a means of controlling or abating environmental pollution or the use of energy in regard to the use, operation or occupancy of the Premises but shall not include any costs to remediate Hazardous Materials at the Premises that are not Lessee’s responsibility under Section 33. The term “Tax” shall include, without limitation, all taxes, assessments, levies, fees, impositions or charges levied, imposed, assessed, measured, or based in any manner whatsoever (i) in whole or in part on the Rent payable by Lessee under this Lease, (ii) upon or with respect to the use, possession, occupancy, leasing, operation or management of the Premises, (iii) upon this transaction or any document to which Lessee is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises, (iv) upon Lessee’s business operations conducted at the Premises (to the extent that this tax could become a lien on the Premises), (v) upon, measured by or reasonably attributable to the cost or value of Lessee’s equipment, furniture, fixtures and other personal property located on the Premises or the cost or value of any leasehold improvements made in or to the Premises by or for Lessee, regardless of whether title to such improvements shall be in Lessor or Lessee, or (vi) in lieu of or equivalent to any Tax set forth in this Section 16. In the event any such Taxes are payable by Lessor and it shall not be lawful for Lessee to reimburse Lessor for such Taxes, then the Rent payable thereunder shall be increased to net Lessor the same net rent after imposition of any such Tax upon Lessor as would have been payable to Lessor prior to the imposition of any such Tax. It is the intention of the parties that Lessor shall be free from all such Taxes and all other governmental impositions and charges of every kind and nature whatsoever. However, nothing contained in this Section 16 shall require Lessee to pay any Federal or State income, franchise, estate, inheritance, succession, transfer or excess profits tax imposed upon Lessor. If any general or special assessment is levied and assessed against the Premises, Lessor agrees to use its best reasonable efforts to cause the assessment to become a lien on the Premises securing repayment of a bond sold to finance the improvements to which the assessment relates which is payable in installments of principal and interest over the maximum term allowed by law. It is understood and agreed that Lessee’s obligation under this paragraph will be prorated to reflect the Commencement Date and the end of the Lease Term. It is further understood that if Taxes cover the Premises and Lessee does not occupy the entire Premises, the Taxes will be allocated to the portion of the Premises occupied by Lessee based on a pro-rata square footage or other equitable basis, as determined by Lessor. Lessee has elected to be responsible to pay real estate taxes directly and Lessee will be responsible for any penalties and interest as a result of not paying the real estate taxes when due. In the event Lessee either: (i) Commits a Lease default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods) or (ii) elects to have Lessor pay the real estate taxes, the real estate taxes (including any accrued penalities and interest as a result of Lessee’s failure to pay the real estate taxes when due) billed by Lessor to Lessee shall be included in the monthly CAC.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">Subject to any limitations or restrictions imposed by any deeds of trust or mortgages now or hereafter covering or affecting the Premises, Lessee shall have the right to contest or review the amount or validity of any Tax by appropriate legal proceedings but which is not to be deemed or construed in any way as relieving, modifying or extending Lessee’s covenant to pay such Tax at the time and in the manner as provided in this Section 16. However, as a condition of Lessee’s right to contest, if such contested Tax is not paid before such contest and if the legal proceedings shall not operate to prevent or stay the collection of the Tax so contested, Lessee shall, before instituting any such proceeding, protect the Premises and the interest of Lessor and of the beneficiary of a deed of trust or the mortgagee of a mortgage affecting the Premises against any lien upon the Premises by a surety bond, issued by an insurance company acceptable to Lessor and in an amount equal to one and one-half (1 1/2) times the amount contested or, at Lessor’s option, the amount of the contested Tax and the interest and penalties in connection therewith. Any contest as to the validity or amount of any Tax, whether before or after payment, shall be made by Lessee in Lessee’s own name, or if required by law, in the name of Lessor or both Lessor and Lessee. Lessee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Lessor from and against any and all costs or expenses, including attorneys’ fees, in connection with any such proceedings brought by Lessee, whether in its own name or not. Lessee shall be entitled to retain any refund of any such contested Tax and penalties or interest thereon which have been paid by Lessee. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as affecting or limiting Lessor’s right to contest any Tax at Lessor’s expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p86">17. Notices: Unless otherwise provided for in this Lease, any and all written notices or other communication (the “Communication”) to be given in connection with this Lease shall be given in writing and shall be given by personal delivery or by mailing by registered or certified mail with postage thereon or recognized overnight courier, fully prepaid, in a sealed envelope addressed to the intended recipient as follows:</p>

          <p id="s1p95">or such other addresses, or individual as may be designated by a Communication given by a party to the other parties as aforesaid. Any Communication given by personal delivery shall be conclusively deemed to have been given and received on a date it is so delivered at such address provided that such date is a business day, otherwise on the first business day following its receipt, and if given by registered or certified mail, on the day on which delivery is made or refused or if given by recognized overnight courier, on the first business day following deposit with such overnight courier.</p>
          <p id="s1p96">18. Entry By Lessor: Lessee shall permit Lessor and its agents to enter into and upon said Premises at all reasonable times using the minimum amount of interference and inconvenience to Lessee and Lessee’s business, subject to any security regulations of Lessee, for the purpose of inspecting the same or for the purpose of maintaining the building in which said Premises are situated, or for the purpose of making repairs, alterations or additions to any other portion of said building, including the erection and maintenance of such scaffolding, canopies, fences and props as may be required, without any rebate of Rent and without any liability to Lessee for any loss of occupation or quiet enjoyment of the Premises; and shall permit Lessor and his agents, at any time within ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Lease Term, to place upon said Premises any usual or ordinary “For Sale” or “For Lease” signs and exhibit the Premises to prospective tenants at reasonable hours.</p>
          <p id="s1p97">19. Destruction Of Premises: In the event of a partial destruction of the said Premises during the Lease Term from any cause which is covered by Lessor’s property insurance (or which would have been covered if Lessor had maintained the property insurance required under this Lease), Lessor shall forthwith repair the same, provided such repairs can be made within one hundred eighty (180) days after receipt of building permit under the laws and regulations of State, Federal, County, or Municipal authorities, but such partial destruction shall in no way annul or void this Lease, except that Lessee shall be entitled to a proportionate reduction of Rent while such repairs are being made. With respect to any partial destruction which Lessor is obligated to repair or may elect to repair under the terms of this paragraph, the provision of Section 1932, Subdivision 2, and of Section 1933, Subdivision 4, of the Civil Code of the State of California are waived by Lessee. In the event that the building in which the subject Premises may be situated is destroyed to an extent greater than thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the replacement cost thereof, Lessor may, at its sole option, elect to terminate this Lease, whether the subject Premises is insured or not. A total destruction of the building in which the subject Premises are situated shall terminate this Lease. Notwithstanding the above, Lessor is only obligated to repair or rebuild to the extent of available insurance proceeds including any deductible amount paid by Lessee. Should Lessor determine that insufficient or no insurance proceeds are available for repair or reconstruction of Premises, Lessor, at its sole option, may terminate the Lease. Lessee shall have the option of continuing this Lease by agreeing to pay all repair costs to the subject Premises. Notwithstanding this Section 19 or Section 21, (i) if the Premises are condemned or damaged by any peril, then Lessee shall have the option to terminate this Lease if the Premises cannot be, or are not in fact, fully restored by Lessor to their prior condition within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the condemnation or damage, and (ii) Landlord shall not have the right to terminate this Lease and shall repair and restore the Premises if the damage to the Premises is (a) due to a risk required to be insured against by Lessor under this Lease or (b) relatively minor (e.g., repair or restoration would cost less than five percent (5%) of the replacement cost of the Premises).</p>
          <p id="s1p98">20. Assignment And Subletting: Lessee shall not assign this Lease, or any interest therein, and shall not sublet the said Premises or any part thereof, or any right or privilege appurtenant thereto, or cause any other person or entity , to occupy or use the Premises, or any portion thereof, without the advance written consent of Lessor which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the above, Lessee may, without the consent of Lessor, assign this Lease or sublet all or any part of the Premises to a bona fide subsidiary or affiliate of Lessee, an entity in which or with which Lessee merges or an entity which acquires all or substantially all of the assets of Lessee (“Excepted Party”). Any such assignment or subletting requiring Lessor’s consent made without Lessor’s consent shall be void, and shall, at the option of the Lessor, terminate this Lease. This Lease shall not, or shall any interest therein, be assignable, as to the interest of Lessee, by operation of law, without the written consent of Lessor. Notwithstanding Lessor’s obligation to provide reasonable approval, Lessor reserves the right to withhold its consent for any proposed sublessee or assignee of Lessee if the proposed sublessee or assignee is a user or generator of Hazardous Materials to an extent greater than Lessee’s use of Hazardous Materials at the Premises as of the Commencement Date. If Lessee desires to assign its rights under this Lease or to sublet all or any part of the Premises to a party other than an Excepted Party, Lessee shall first notify Lessor of the proposed terms and conditions of such assignment or subletting. With respect to any such proposed assignment of this Lease or sublease if the assignee or sublessee, respectively, fully occupies either the single story 60,482 square foot building or the 2-story 35,208 square foot building or the entire Premises, Lessor, at its sole option, shall have the right (i) to enter into a direct Lessor-lessee relationship with such party under such proposed terms and conditions, in which event Lessee shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent of the Lessor-lessee relationship entered into between Lessor and such third party, or (ii) to terminate the Lease and relieve Lessee of all Lease obligations occurring after the termination of the Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee may assign this Lease to an Excepted Party, provided there is no substantial reduction in the net worth of the Excepted Party below that of Lessee immediately before such assignment and the Security Deposit will remain in place. Whether or not Lessor’s consent to a sublease or assignment is required, in the event of any sublease or assignment, Lessee shall be and shall remain primarily liable for the performance of all conditions, covenants, and obligations of Lessee hereunder and, in the event of a default by an assignee or sublessee, Lessor may proceed directly against the original Lessee hereunder and/or any other predecessor of such assignee or sublessee without the necessity of exhausting remedies against said assignee or sublessee. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Lessor acknowledges that Lessee currently intends to market the Premises and this Lease to prospective assignees of Lessee’s interest under this Lease. Lessor therefore agrees that Lessor will consent to such a proposed assignment of this Lease by Lessee, provided that (a) Lessee is not then in default under this Lease (beyond applicable notice and cure periods), (b) the proposed assignee has a net worth in excess of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and the assignee’s financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, has net income and positive cash flow, excluding extraordinary items, during the four (4) calendar quarters immediately precedingLessee’s request for Lessor’s consent to such assignment, and (c) Lessee pays all brokerage commissions and any other out of pocket costs in connection with completing such assignment. Upon any such assignment of this Lease, Lessor and Lessee shall execute a Settlement Agreement and Release in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, and the assignee shall be deemed to be an Excepted Party hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p99">20.1 Consideration to Relocate: If Lessor recaptures the Premises pursuant to Section 20 or Lessee and Lessor mutually agree on an assignment of the Lease to another tenant, then promptly after Lessee determines its space needs in connection with the relocation (including acceptable geographic locations), Lessee and Lessor will meet and confer for up to fifteen (15) days to consider relocating Lessee to another premises owned by Lessor, but neither party shall have any obligation to conclude any such relocation.</p>
          <p id="s1p100">21. Condemnation: If any part of the Premises shall be taken for any public or quasi-public use, under any statute or by right of eminent domain or private purchase in lieu thereof, and a part thereof remains which is susceptible of occupation hereunder, this Lease shall as to the part so taken, terminate as of the date title vests in the condemnor or purchaser, and the Rent payable hereunder shall be adjusted so that the Lessee shall be required to pay for the remainder of the Lease Term only that portion of Rent as the value of the part remaining. The rental adjustment resulting will be computed at the same Rental rate for the remaining part not taken. Lessor shall have the option to terminate this Lease as of the date when title to the part so taken vests in the condemnor or purchaser. If all of the Premises, or such part thereof be taken so that there does not remain a portion susceptible for occupation hereunder, this Lease shall thereupon terminate. If a part or all of the Premises be taken, all compensation awarded upon such taking shall be payable to the Lessor. Lessee shall have the right to file a separate claim to recover Lessee’s relocation costs and the unamortized value of all improvements and alterations made to the Premises at Lessee’s cost during the Lease Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p101">22. Effects Of Conveyance: The term “Lessor” as used in this Lease, means only the owner for the time being of the land and building constituting the Premises, so that, in the event of any sale of said land or building, Lessor shall be and hereby is entirely freed and relieved of all covenants and obligations of Lessor thereafter accruing hereunder, and it shall be deemed and construed, without further agreement between the parties and the purchaser of any such sale, that the purchaser of the building has assumed and agreed to carry out any and all covenants and obligations of the Lessor hereunder. If any security is given by Lessee to secure the faithful performance of all or any of the covenants of this Lease on the part of Lessee, Lessor shall transfer and deliver the security, as such, to the purchaser at any such sale of the building, and thereupon the Lessor shall be discharged from any further liability.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">23. Subordination: This Lease, in the event Lessor notifies Lessee in writing, shall be subordinate to any ground lease, deed of trust, or other hypothecation for security now or hereafter placed upon the real property at which the Premises are a part and to any and all advances made on the security thereof and to renewals, modifications, replacements and extensions thereof. Lessee agrees to promptly execute any commercially reasonable documents which may be required to effectuate such subordination. Notwithstanding such subordination, if Lessee is not in default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods), Lessee’s right to quiet possession of the Premises shall not be disturbed or affected by any subordination.</p>
          <p id="s1p103">24. Waiver: The waiver by Lessor or Lessee of any breach of any term, covenant or condition, herein contained shall not be construed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition or any subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition therein contained. The subsequent acceptance of Rent hereunder by Lessor shall not be deemed to be a waiver of Lessee’s breach of any term, covenant, or condition of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">25. Holding Over: Any holding over after the end of the Lease Term requires Lessor’s written approval prior to the end of the Lease Term, which, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Lease, Lessor may withhold. Such holding over shall be construed to be a tenancy at sufferance from month to month. Lessee shall pay to Lessor monthly base rent equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the monthly base rent installment due in the last month of the Lease Term and all other additional rent and all other terms and conditions of the Lease shall apply, so far as applicable. Holding over by Lessee without written approval of Lessor shall subject Lessee to the liabilities and obligations provided for in this Lease and by law, including, but not limited to those in Section 2.1 of this Lease. Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless against any loss or liability resulting from any delay caused by Lessee in surrendering the Premises, including without limitation, any claims made or penalties incurred by any succeeding lessee or by Lessor. No holding over shall be deemed or construed to exercise any option to extend or renew this Lease in lieu of full and timely exercise of any such option as required hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p105">26. Lessor’s Liability: If Lessee should recover a money judgment against Lessor arising in connection with this Lease, the judgment shall be satisfied only out of the Lessor’s interest in the Premises and, if at the time any portion of the Premises has been damaged or condemned, the insurance and condemnation proceeds thereof, Neither Lessor or any of its officers, directors, employees or partners shall be liable personally for any deficiency.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">27. Estoppel Certificates: Lessee shall at any time during the Lease Term, upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice from Lessor, execute and deliver to Lessor a statement in writing certifying that, this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification) and the dates to which the Rent and other charges have been paid in advance, if any, and acknowledging that there are not, to Lessee’s knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of Lessor hereunder or specifying such defaults if they are claimed. Any such statement may be conclusively relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of the Premises. Lessee’s failure to deliver such a statement within such time shall be conclusive upon the Lessee that (a) this Lease is in full force and effect, without modification except as may be represented by Lessor; (b) there are no uncured defaults in Lessor’s performance.</p>
          <p id="s1p107">28. Time: Time is of the essence of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">29. Captions: The headings on titles to the paragraphs of this Lease are not a part of this Lease and shall have no effect upon the construction or interpretation of any part thereof. This instrument contains all of the agreements and conditions made between the parties hereto and may not be modified orally or in any other manner than by an agreement in writing signed by all of the parties hereto or their respective successors in interest.</p>

Earthquake Insurance: Lessee agrees that it will pay, as additional Rent, which shall be included in the monthly CAC, an amount not to exceed Thirty Eight Thousand Two Hundred Seventy Six and 00/100’s Dollars ($38,276) per year for earthquake insurance if Lessor desires to obtain some form of earthquake insurance in the future, if and when available, on terms acceptable to Lessor as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of Lessor; provided, however, that (i) Lessee shall only be required to pay such amount if Lessor is required to carry such earthquake insurance by an unaffiliated, commercial lender holding a mortgage or deed of trust on the Premises, and (ii) Lessee shall not in any event be required to pay any amount in excess of the commercially reasonable premiums actually paid by Lessor for such earthquake insurance for the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">32. Habitual Default: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 14 herein, Lessor and Lessee agree that if Lessee shall have defaulted in the payment of Rent (after applicable notice and cure periods) for two or more times during any twelve month period during the Lease Term, then such conduct shall, at the option of the Lessor, represent a separate event of default which cannot be cured by Lessee. Lessee acknowledges that the purpose of this provision is to prevent repetitive defaults by the Lessee under the Lease, which constitute a hardship to the Lessor and deprive the Lessor of the timely performance by the Lessee hereunder.</p>

          <p id="s1p136">(i) Lessee shall give Lessor written notice of its exercise of its option to extend no earlier than twelve (12) , nor later than six (6) calendar months before the Lease Term would end but for said exercise. If Lessee and Lessor have not agreed to rental terms in writing, Lessee may withdraw its notice of exercise of an extension option prior to six (6) months before the Lease Term would end but for said exercise. Lessor shall provide Lessee with Lessor’s proposed base monthly rent for the option period within twenty (20) days of Lessee’s written request. However, once Lessee delivers a notice of exercise of an option to extend the Lease Term it may not be withdrawn except as provided for herein and subject to the provisions of this Section 35, such notice shall operate to extend the Lease Term. Upon any extension of the Lease Term pursuant to this Section 35, the term “Lease Term” as used in this Lease shall thereafter include the then extended term. Time is of the essence.</p>
          <p id="s1p137">(ii) Lessee may not extend the Lease Term pursuant to any option granted by this Section 35 if Lessee is in default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods) as of the date of the exercise of its option. If Lessee has committed a default by Lessee as defined in Section 14 or 32 that has not been cured or waived by Lessor in writing by the date that any extended term is to commence, then Lessor may elect not to allow the Lease Term to be extended, notwithstanding any notice given by Lessee of an exercise of this option to extend.</p>
          <p id="s1p138">(iii) All terms and conditions of this Lease shall apply during the extended term, except that the base rent and rental increases for each extended term shall be determined as provided in Section 35 (B) below</p>
          <p id="s1p139">(iv) The option rights of Sipex Corporation granted under this Section 35 are granted for Sipex Corporation’s personal benefit and may not be assigned or transferred by Sipex Corporation, except in connection with any assignment or transfer to an Excepted Party.</p>
          <p id="s1p140">B. Extended Term Rent — Option Period: The monthly base rent for the Premises during the extended term shall equal ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair market monthly base rent for the Premises as of the commencement date of the extended term plus CAC. Promptly upon Lessee’s exercise of the option to extend, Lessee and Lessor shall meet and attempt to agree on the fair market monthly base rent for the Premises as of the commencement date of the extended term. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the amount of the monthly base rent for the extended term prior to commencement thereof, the monthly base rent for the extended term shall be determined by appraisal in the manner hereafter set forth. Annual base rent increases during the extended term shall be three and one-half percent (3.5%) per year. In the event it becomes necessary under this paragraph to determine the fair market monthly base rent of the Premises by appraisal, Lessor and Lessee each shall appoint a real estate appraiser within five days after Lessor or Lessee notifies the other party that the proposed rental rate for the extended term is unacceptable, who shall be a member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraiser (“AIREA”) and such appraisers shall each determine the fair market monthly base rent for the Premises taking into account the value of the Premises and the amenities provided by the outside areas, the common areas, and the Building, and prevailing comparable rentals in the area, but shall not take into account the value of any improvements or alterations made to the Premises at Lessee’s expense during the Lease Term. Such appraisers shall, within twenty (20) business days after their appointment, complete their appraisals and submit their appraisal reports to Lessor and Lessee. If the fair market monthly base rent of the Premises established in the two (2) appraisals varies by five percent (5%) or less of the higher rent, the average of the two shall be controlling. If said fair market monthly base rent varies by more than five percent (5%) of the higher rental, said appraisers, within ten (10) days after submission of the last appraisal, shall appoint a third appraiser who shall be a member of the AIREA and who shall also be experienced in the appraisal of rent values and adjustment practices for commercial properties in the vicinity of the Premises. Such third appraiser shall, within twenty (20) business days after his appointment, determine by appraisal the fair market monthly base rent of the Premises taking into account the same factors referred to above, and submit his appraisal report to Lessor and Lessee. The fair market monthly base rent determined by the third appraiser for the Premises shall be controlling, unless it is less than that set forth in the lower appraisal previously obtained, in which case the base rent set forth in said lower appraisal shall be controlling, or unless it is greater than that set forth in the higher appraisal previously obtained in which case the base rent set forth in said higher appraisal shall be controlling. If either Lessor or Lessee fails to appoint an appraiser, or if an appraiser appointed by either of them fails, after his appointment to submit his appraisal within the required period in accordance with the foregoing, the appraisal submitted by the appraiser properly appointed and timely submitting his appraisal shall be controlling. If the two appraisers appointed by Lessor and Lessee are unable to agree upon a third appraiser within the required period in accordance with the foregoing, application shall be made within twenty (20) days thereafter by either Lessor or Lessee to AIREA, which shall appoint a member of said institute willing to serve as appraiser. The cost of all appraisals under this subparagraph shall be borne equally be Lessor and Lessee.</p>

Indemnification of Lessor: Except to the extent caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor or Lessor’s Agents, Lessee shall defend, indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from and against any and all obligations, losses, costs, expenses, claims, demands, attorney’s fees, investigation costs or liabilities on account of, or arising out of the use, condition, or occupancy of the Premises or any act or omission to act of Lessee or Lessee’s Agents or any occurrence in, upon, about or at the Premises during the Lease Term or any extension thereof, including, without limitation, any of the foregoing provisions arising out of the use, generation, manufacture, installation, release, discharge, storage, or disposal of Hazardous Materials by Lessee or Lessee’s Agents during the Lease Term or any extension thereof.
