It is expressly understood and agreed that (i) any delay in delivery or otherwise in the performance of this Agreement by the Seller due in whole or in part to any delay in or failure of the delivery of, or any other event or circumstance relating to, the Propulsion Systems or Buyer Furnished Equipment or (ii) any delay caused by the Buyer's negligence or the Buyer's fault will each constitute Excusable Delay for the Seller. The Seller will as soon as practicable after becoming aware of any delay falling within the provisions of this sub-Clause 10.1 (i) exert all reasonable best efforts to minimize the effects of such occurrence, (ii) notify the Buyer of such delay and of the probable extent thereof and (iii) subject to the following provisions, as soon as practicable after the removal of the cause or causes for delay notify Buyer of the actual extent of the delay and resume the performance of those obligations affected under this Agreement.

Should the Aircraft be subject to a Total Loss prior to delivery further to such event, a further notice will specify the earliest date reasonably possible, consistent with the Seller's other contractual commitments and production capabilities, by which the Seller would be able to deliver a replacement for such Aircraft. This Agreement will terminate as to such Aircraft unless the Buyer gives the Seller written notice, within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Buyer of the notice from the Seller of such Total Loss, that the Buyer desires the Seller to manufacture and deliver to the Buyer a replacement for such Aircraft. If the Buyer gives such notice to the Seller, the Seller will manufacture and deliver to the Buyer, at the earliest date reasonably possible consistent with the Seller's other contractual commitments and production capabilities, an aircraft to replace the Aircraft subject to Total Loss, and the parties will execute an amendment to the Agreement to which such Aircraft subject to Total Loss related to evidence the delivery date for such replacement aircraft; provided, however, that nothing herein will obligate the Seller to manufacture and deliver such replacement aircraft if such manufacture would require the reactivation of its production line for the model of aircraft purchased hereunder. The terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to the Aircraft subject to Total Loss will apply to the replacement aircraft. In the event of termination of this Agreement as to an Aircraft subject to Total Loss, the obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder to the extent related to such Aircraft will be discharged.
