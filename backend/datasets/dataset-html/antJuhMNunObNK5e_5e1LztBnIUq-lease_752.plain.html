          <p id="s1p61">Exhibit C Acknowledgement of Term Commencement Date and Term Expiration Date</p>

          <p id="s1p67">Exhibit I Form of Estoppel Certificate</p>
          <p id="s1p68">3. Term. The actual term of this Lease (as the same may be extended pursuant to Article 42 hereof or otherwise, and as the same may be earlier terminated in accordance with this Lease, the “Term”) shall commence on the actual Term Commencement Date (as defined in Article 4) and end on April 30, 2017 (such date, the “Term Expiration Date”), subject to earlier termination of this Lease as provided herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p69">4. Possession and Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p70">4.1 The “Term Commencement Date” shall be the earlier of (a) the Estimated Term Commencement Date and (b) the day the work described in the Work Letter (the “Tenant Improvements”) is Substantially Complete and Tenant is in receipt of a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy. Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord written acknowledgment of the actual Term Commencement Date and the Term Expiration Date within ten (10) days after</p>
          <p id="s1p71">3</p>
          <p id="s1p72">Tenant takes occupancy of the Premises, in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto. Failure to execute and deliver such acknowledgment, however, shall not affect the Term Commencement Date or Landlord’s or Tenant’s liability hereunder. Failure by Tenant to obtain validation by any medical review board or other similar governmental licensing of the Premises required for the Permitted Use by Tenant shall not serve to extend the Term Commencement Date. The term “Substantially Complete” or “Substantial Completion” means that the Tenant Improvements are substantially complete in accordance with the Approved Plans (as defined in the Work Letter), except for minor punch list items.</p>
          <p id="s1p73">4.2 Tenant shall cause the Tenant Improvements to be constructed in the Premises pursuant to the Work Letter attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “Work Letter”) at a cost to Landlord not to exceed Two Million Four Hundred Fifty-Eight Eight Hundred Dollars ($2,458,800) (based upon Seventy-Five Dollars ($75) per square foot of Rentable Area (as defined below)) (the “TI Allowance”). The TI Allowance may be applied to the costs of (n) construction, (o) project review by Landlord (which fee shall equal the actual cost to Landlord for all third party expenses related to Landlord’s review of the Tenant Improvements), (p) space planning, architect, engineering and other related services performed by third parties unaffiliated with Tenant, (q) building permits and other taxes, fees, charges and levies by Governmental Authorities (as defined below) for permits or for inspections of the Tenant Improvements, (r) costs and expenses for labor, material, equipment and fixtures, and (s) costs and expenses for data/telecom cabling, moving and furniture; provided, however, that Tenant may not apply more than Three Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Forty Dollars ($327,840) (based upon Ten Dollars ($10) per square foot of Rentable Area) of the TI Allowance towards the costs and expenses set forth in Subsection 4.2(s). In no event shall the TI Allowance be used for (v) the cost of work that is not authorized by the Approved Plans (as defined in the Work Letter) or otherwise approved in writing by Landlord, (w) payments to Tenant or any affiliates of Tenant, (x) the purchase of any furniture, personal property or other non-building system equipment, (y) costs resulting from any default by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease or (z) costs that are recoverable by Tenant from a third party (e.g., insurers, warrantors, or tortfeasors).</p>
          <p id="s1p74">4.3 Tenant shall have until the date (the “TI Deadline”) that is eighteen (18) months after the Execution Date to expend the unused portion of the TI Allowance, after which date Landlord’s obligation to fund such costs shall expire.</p>
          <p id="s1p75">4.4 In no event shall any unused TI Allowance entitle Tenant to a credit against Rent payable under this Lease. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord (i) a certificate of occupancy for the Premises suitable for the Permitted Use and (ii) a Certificate of Substantial Completion in the form of the American Institute of Architects document G704, executed by the project architect and the general contractor.</p>
          <p id="s1p76">4.5 Prior to entering upon the Premises, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord evidence satisfactory to Landlord that insurance coverages required of Tenant under the provisions of Article 23 are in effect, and such entry shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this Lease other than the payment of Base Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p77">4.6 The architect, engineering consultants, design team, general contractor and subcontractors responsible for the construction of the Tenant Improvements shall be selected by</p>
          <p id="s1p78">4</p>
          <p id="s1p79">Tenant and approved by Landlord, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. Landlord may refuse to use any architects, consultants, contractors, subcontractors or material suppliers that Landlord reasonably believes are likely to cause labor disharmony.</p>
          <p id="s1p80">4.7 During construction of the Tenant Improvements, Tenant shall use power from current meter(s) that exclusively service the Premises or shall install temporary meters for all water, gas, electricity and other utilities supplied to the first floor Premises for use during Tenant’s construction of the Tenant Improvements and until the Term Commencement Date. Tenant shall pay all utility charges, together with any fees, surcharges and taxes thereon, beginning on the Execution Date (which costs are eligible for reimbursement through the TI Allowance).</p>
          <p id="s1p81">5. Condition of Premises. Tenant acknowledges that, except as set forth herein, neither Landlord nor any agent of Landlord has made any representation or warranty with respect to the condition of the Premises, the Building or the Project, or with respect to the suitability of the Premises, the Building or the Project for the conduct of Tenant’s business. Tenant acknowledges that (a) it is familiar with the condition of the Premises and agrees to take the same in its condition “as is” as of the Execution Date and (b) Landlord shall have no obligation to alter, repair or otherwise prepare the Premises for Tenant’s occupancy or to pay for or construct any improvements to the Premises, except with respect to the TI Allowance. Tenant’s taking of possession of the Premises shall, except as otherwise set forth herein, conclusively establish that the Premises, the Building and the Project were at such time in good, sanitary and satisfactory condition and repair.</p>
          <p id="s1p82">6. Rentable Area.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">6.1. The term “Rentable Area” shall reflect such areas as reasonably calculated by Landlord’s architect, as the same may be reasonably adjusted from time to time by Landlord in consultation with Landlord’s architect to reflect changes to the Premises, the Building or the Project, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Base Rent or Tenant’s Pro Rata Share hereunder be increased as a result of any such adjustment.</p>
          <p id="s1p84">6.2. The Rentable Area of the Building is generally determined by making separate calculations of Rentable Area applicable to each floor within the Building and totaling the Rentable Area of all floors within the Building. The Rentable Area of a floor is computed by measuring to the outside finished surface of the permanent outer Building walls. The full area calculated as previously set forth is included as Rentable Area, without deduction for columns and projections or vertical penetrations, including stairs, elevator shafts, flues, pipe shafts, vertical ducts and the like, as well as such items’ enclosing walls.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">6.3. The term “Rentable Area,” when applied to the Premises, is that area equal to the usable area of the Premises, plus an equitable allocation of Rentable Area within the Building that is not then utilized or expected to be utilized as usable area, including that portion of the Building devoted to corridors, equipment rooms, restrooms, elevator lobby, atrium and mailroom.</p>
          <p id="s1p86">5</p>
          <p id="s1p87">7. Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p88">7.1. Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Base Rent for the Premises, commencing on May 1, 2012 (the “Rent Commencement Date”), the sums set forth in Section 2.3, subject to the rental adjustments provided in Article 8 hereof. Base Rent shall be paid in equal monthly installments as set forth in Section 2.3, subject to the rental adjustments provided in Article 8 hereof, each in advance on the first day of each and every calendar month during the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p89">7.2. In addition to Base Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent (“Additional Rent”) at times hereinafter specified in this Lease (a) Tenant’s Share (as defined below) of Operating Expenses (as defined below), (b) the Property Management Fee (as defined below) and (c) any other amounts that Tenant assumes or agrees to pay under the provisions of this Lease that are owed to Landlord, including any and all other sums that may become due by reason of any default of Tenant or failure on Tenant’s part to comply with the agreements, terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be performed by Tenant, after notice and the lapse of any applicable cure periods.</p>
          <p id="s1p90">7.3. Base Rent and Additional Rent shall together be denominated “Rent.” Rent shall be paid to Landlord, without abatement, deduction or offset, in lawful money of the United States of America at the office of Landlord as set forth in Section 2.8 or to such other person or at such other place as Landlord may from time designate in writing. In the event the Term commences or ends on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, then the Rent for such fraction of a month shall be prorated for such period on the basis of a thirty (30) day month and shall be paid at the then-current rate for such fractional month.</p>
          <p id="s1p91">8. Rent Adjustments. Base Rent shall be subject to an annual upward adjustment of three percent (3%) of the then-current Base Rent. The first such adjustment shall become effective commencing on the first (1st) annual anniversary of the Term Commencement Date, and subsequent adjustments shall become effective on every successive annual anniversary for so long as this Lease continues in effect.</p>

Operating Expenses shall not include any net income, franchise, capital stock, estate or inheritance taxes, or taxes that are the personal obligation of Tenant or of another tenant of the Project; and</p>
          <p id="s1p97">(b) All other costs of any kind paid or incurred by Landlord in connection with the operation or maintenance of the Building and the Project, including costs of repairs and replacements to improvements within the Project as appropriate to maintain the Project as required hereunder, including costs of funding such reasonable reserves as Landlord, consistent with good business practice, may establish to provide for future repairs and replacements; costs of utilities furnished to the Common Areas; sewer fees; cable television; trash collection; cleaning, including windows; heating; ventilation; air-conditioning; maintenance of landscaping and grounds; maintenance of drives and parking areas; maintenance of the roof; security services and devices; building supplies; maintenance or replacement of equipment utilized for operation and maintenance of the Project; license, permit and inspection fees; sales, use and excise taxes on goods and services purchased by Landlord in connection with the operation, maintenance or repair of the Building or Project systems and equipment; telephone, postage, stationery supplies and other expenses incurred in connection with the operation, maintenance or repair of the Project; accounting, legal and other professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Project; costs of replacement, in due course, of furniture, draperies, carpeting, landscaping and other customary and ordinary items of personal property provided by Landlord for use in Common Areas; the applicable portion of Permitted Capital Expenditures (as defined and detailed below); costs of complying with Applicable Laws (except to the extent such costs are incurred to remedy non-compliance as of the Execution Date with Applicable Laws); costs to keep the Project in compliance with, or fees otherwise required under, any CC&amp;Rs (as defined below); insurance premiums, including premiums for public liability, property casualty, earthquake, terrorism and environmental coverages; portions of insured losses paid by Landlord as part of the deductible portion of a loss pursuant to the terms of insurance policies; service contracts; costs of services of independent contractors retained to do work of a nature referenced above; and costs of compensation (including employment taxes and fringe benefits) of all persons who perform regular and recurring duties connected with the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the Project, its equipment, the adjacent walks, landscaped areas, drives and parking areas, including janitors, floor waxers, window washers, watchmen, gardeners, sweepers and handymen. “Permitted Capital Expenditures” shall mean all capital expenditures (i) for maintaining, repairing and replacing obsolete equipment, (ii) for the primary purpose of reducing Operating Expenses or (iii) required by any Governmental Authority to comply with Applicable Laws (but not to remedy non-compliance as of the Execution Date with Applicable Laws).

          <p id="s1p101">9.2.

          <p id="s1p102">(x) The “Property Management Fee” shall equal three percent (3%) of Base Rent due from Tenant. Tenant shall pay the Property Management Fee in accordance with Section 9.2 with respect to the entire Term, including any extensions thereof or any holdover periods, regardless of whether Tenant is obligated to pay Base Rent, Operating Expenses or any other Rent with respect to any such period or portion thereof.</p>

Any additional sum due from Tenant to Landlord shall be immediately due and payable. If the amounts paid by Tenant pursuant to this Section exceed Tenant’s Share of Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year, then Landlord shall credit the difference against the Rent next due and owing from Tenant; provided that, if the Lease term has expired, Landlord shall accompany said statement with payment for the amount of such difference.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">(z) Any amount due under this Section for any period that is less than a full month shall be prorated (based on a thirty (30)-day month) for such fractional month.</p>
          <p id="s1p105">9.3. Tenant shall be responsible for Operating Expenses from the Rent Commencement Date. Tenant’s responsibility for Tenant’s Share of Operating Expenses shall continue to the latest of (x) the date of termination of the Lease, (y) the date Tenant has fully vacated the Premises and (z) if termination of the Lease is due to a default by Tenant, as contemplated by Article 31 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">8</p>
          <p id="s1p107">9.4. Operating Expenses for the calendar year in which Tenant’s obligation to share therein commences and for the calendar year in which such obligation ceases shall be prorated on a basis reasonably determined by Landlord. Expenses such as taxes, assessments and insurance premiums that are incurred for an extended time period shall be prorated based upon the time periods to which they apply so that the amounts attributed to the Premises relate in a reasonable manner to the time period wherein Tenant has an obligation to share in Operating Expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">9.5. Within five (5) business days after the end of each calendar month, Tenant shall submit to Landlord an invoice, or, in the event an invoice is not available, an itemized list, of all costs and expenses that (a) Tenant has incurred (either internally or by employing third parties) during the prior month and (b) for which Tenant reasonably believes it is entitled to reimbursements from Landlord pursuant to the terms of this Lease or that Tenant reasonably believes is the responsibility of Landlord pursuant to this Lease or the Work Letter.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">9.6. In the event that the Building or Project is less than fully leased, Tenant acknowledges that Landlord may extrapolate Operating Expenses that vary depending on the occupancy of the Building or Project, as applicable, by dividing (a) the total cost of such Operating Expenses by (b) the quotient of (i) the Rentable Area of the Building or Project (as applicable) that is leased divided by (ii) the Rentable Area of the Building or Project (as applicable), then multiplying (y) the resulting quotient ((a) divided by (b)) by (z) ninety-five percent (95%), then multiplying the product ((y) times (z)) by Tenant’s Pro Rata Share. In no event shall Landlord shall not recover more than one hundred percent (100%) of Operating Expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">9.7. Within ninety (90) days after the conclusion of each calendar year (or such longer period as may be reasonably required by Landlord), Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a statement (the “Statement”) showing in reasonable detail the actual Operating Expenses and Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year. Any additional sum due from Tenant to Landlord shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of the Statement. If the amounts paid by Tenant pursuant to this Section exceed Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year, then Landlord shall credit the difference against the Rent next due and owing from Tenant; provided that, if the Term has expired, Landlord shall accompany such statement with payment for the amount of the difference. Within forty-five (45) days after Tenant’s receipt of the Statement (and in no event more often than once in any one (1) year period), Tenant may review, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, the books and records supporting the Statement in an office of Landlord or Landlord’s agent during normal business hours, upon giving Landlord ten (10) days’ advance written notice. If Tenant utilizes an independent accountant to perform such review, such accountant shall (a) be one of national standing, (b) be reasonably acceptable to Landlord and (c) not be compensated on a contingency basis. In the event that Tenant’s review of Landlord’s records indicate that Tenant has underpaid or overpaid Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses, Tenant and Landlord shall make appropriate payments or credits as provided above. If Landlord and Tenant determine that Landlord overcharged Tenant for Operating Expenses for the calendar year in question by five percent (5%) or more, Landlord shall be required to reimburse Tenant for any reasonable third party audit costs incurred by Tenant in accordance with this Section.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">9</p>
          <p id="s1p112">10. Taxes on Tenant’s Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">10.1. Tenant shall pay prior to delinquency any and all taxes levied against any personal property or trade fixtures placed by Tenant in or about the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">10.2. If any such taxes on Tenant’s personal property or trade fixtures are levied against Landlord or Landlord’s property or, if the assessed valuation of the Building, the Property or the Project is increased by inclusion therein of a value attributable to Tenant’s personal property or trade fixtures, and if Landlord, after written notice to Tenant, pays the taxes based upon any such increase in the assessed value of the Building, the Property or the Project, then Tenant shall, upon demand, repay to Landlord the taxes so paid by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p115">10.3. If any improvements in or alterations to the Premises, whether owned by Landlord or Tenant and whether or not affixed to the real property so as to become a part thereof, are assessed for real property tax purposes at a valuation higher than the valuation at which improvements conforming to Landlord’s building standards (the “Building Standard”) in other spaces in the Building are assessed, then the real property taxes and assessments levied against Landlord or the Building, the Property or the Project by reason of such excess assessed valuation shall be deemed to be taxes levied against personal property of Tenant and shall be governed by the provisions of Section 10.2. Any such excess assessed valuation due to improvements in or alterations to space in the Project leased by other tenants at the Project shall not be included in Operating Expenses. If the records of the County Assessor are available and sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for determining whether said Tenant improvements or alterations are assessed at a higher valuation than the Building Standard, then such records shall be binding on both Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p116">11. Security Deposit.</p>
          <p id="s1p117">11.1. Tenant shall deposit with Landlord on or before the Execution Date the sum set forth in Section 2.6 (the “Security Deposit”), which sum shall be held by Landlord as security for the faithful performance by Tenant of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant during the period commencing on the Execution Date and ending upon the expiration or termination of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease. If Tenant defaults with respect to any provision of this Lease, including any provision relating to the payment of Rent, then Landlord may (but shall not be required to) use, apply or retain all or any part of the Security Deposit for the payment of any Rent or any other sum in default, or to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage that Landlord may suffer by reason of Tenant’s default. If any portion of the Security Deposit is so used or applied, then Tenant shall, within ten (10) days following demand therefor, deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount, and Tenant’s failure to do so shall be a material breach of this Lease. The provisions of this Article shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">11.2. In the event of bankruptcy or other debtor-creditor proceedings against Tenant, the Security Deposit shall be deemed to be applied first to the payment of Rent and other charges due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.</p>
          <p id="s1p119">10</p>
          <p id="s1p120">11.3. Landlord may deliver to any purchaser of Landlord’s interest in the Premises the funds deposited hereunder by Tenant, and thereupon Landlord shall be discharged from any further liability with respect to such deposit. This provision shall also apply to any subsequent transfers.</p>
          <p id="s1p121">11.4. If Tenant shall fully and faithfully perform every provision of this Lease to be performed by it, then the Security Deposit, or any balance thereof, shall be returned to Tenant (or, at Landlord’s option, to the last assignee of Tenant’s interest hereunder) within thirty (30) days after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">11.5. If the Security Deposit shall be in cash, Landlord shall hold the Security Deposit in an account at a banking organization selected by Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord shall not be required to maintain a separate account for the Security Deposit, but may intermingle it with other funds of Landlord. Landlord shall be entitled to all interest and/or dividends, if any, accruing on the Security Deposit. Landlord shall not be required to credit Tenant with any interest for any period during which Landlord does not receive interest on the Security Deposit.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">11.6. The Security Deposit may be in the form of cash, a letter of credit or any other security instrument acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion. Tenant may at any time, except when Tenant is in Default (as defined below), deliver a letter of credit (the “L/C Security”) as the entire Security Deposit, as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p124">(a) If Tenant elects to deliver L/C Security, then Tenant shall provide Landlord, and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term and until the date that is six (6) months after the then-current Term Expiration Date, a letter of credit in the form of Exhibit E issued by an issuer reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, in the amount of the Security Deposit, with an initial term of at least one year. Landlord may require the L/C Security to be re-issued by a different issuer at any time during the Term if Landlord reasonably believes that the issuing bank of the L/C Security is or may soon become insolvent; provided, however, Landlord shall return the existing L/C Security to the existing issuer immediately upon receipt of the substitute L/C Security. If any issuer of the L/C Security shall become insolvent or placed into FDIC receivership, then Tenant shall immediately deliver to Landlord (without the requirement of notice from Landlord) substitute L/C Security issued by an issuer reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, and otherwise conforming to the requirements set forth in this Article. As used herein with respect to the issuer of the L/C Security, “insolvent” shall mean the determination of insolvency as made by such issuer’s primary bank regulator (i.e., the state bank supervisor for state chartered banks; the OCC or OTS, respectively, for federally chartered banks or thrifts; or the Federal Reserve for its member banks). If, at the Term Expiration Date, any Rent remains uncalculated or unpaid, then: (i) Landlord shall with reasonable diligence complete any necessary calculations; (ii) Tenant shall extend the expiry date of such L/C Security from time to time as Landlord reasonably requires; and (iii) in such extended period, Landlord shall not unreasonably refuse to consent to an appropriate reduction of the L/C Security. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord’s reasonable out-of-pocket legal costs in handling Landlord’s acceptance of L/C Security or its replacement or extension.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">11</p>
          <p id="s1p126">(b) If Tenant delivers to Landlord satisfactory L/C Security in place of the entire Security Deposit, Landlord shall remit to Tenant any cash Security Deposit Landlord previously held.</p>
          <p id="s1p127">(c) Landlord may draw upon the L/C Security, and hold and apply the proceeds in the same manner and for the same purposes as the Security Deposit, if: (i) an uncured Default (as defined below) exists; (ii) as of the date forty-five (45) days before any L/C Security expires (even if such scheduled expiry date is after the Term Expiration Date) Tenant has not delivered to Landlord an amendment or replacement for such L/C Security, reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, extending the expiry date to the earlier of (1) six (6) months after the then-current Term Expiration Date or (2) the date one year after the then-current expiry date of the L/C Security; (iii) the L/C Security provides for automatic renewals, Landlord asks the issuer to confirm the current L/C Security expiry date, and the issuer fails to do so within ten (10) business days; (iv) Tenant fails to pay (when and as Landlord reasonably requires) any bank charges for Landlord’s transfer of the L/C Security; or (v) the issuer of the L/C Security ceases, or announces that it will cease, to maintain an office in the city where Landlord may present drafts under the L/C Security (and fails to permit drawing upon the L/C Security by overnight courier or facsimile). This Section does not limit any other provisions of this Lease allowing Landlord to draw the L/C Security under specified circumstances.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">(d) Tenant shall not seek to enjoin, prevent, or otherwise interfere with Landlord’s draw under L/C Security, even if it violates this Lease. Tenant acknowledges that the only effect of a wrongful draw would be to substitute a cash Security Deposit for L/C Security, causing Tenant no legally recognizable damage. Landlord shall hold the proceeds of any draw in the same manner and for the same purposes as a cash Security Deposit. In the event of a wrongful draw, the parties shall cooperate to allow Tenant to post replacement L/C Security simultaneously with the return to Tenant of the wrongfully drawn sums, and Landlord shall upon request confirm in writing to the issuer of the L/C Security that Landlord’s draw was erroneous.</p>
          <p id="s1p129">(e) If Landlord transfers its interest in the Premises, then Tenant shall at Tenant’s expense, within five (5) business days after receiving a request from Landlord, deliver (and, if the issuer requires, Landlord shall consent to) an amendment to the L/C Security naming Landlord’s grantee as substitute beneficiary. If the required Security Deposit changes while L/C Security is in force, then Tenant shall deliver (and, if the issuer requires, Landlord shall consent to) a corresponding amendment to the L/C Security.</p>
          <p id="s1p130">12. Use.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">12.1. Tenant shall use the Premises for the purpose set forth in Section 2.7, and shall not use the Premises, or permit or suffer the Premises to be used, for any other purpose without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">12.2. Tenant shall not use or occupy the Premises in violation of Applicable Laws; zoning ordinances; or the certificate of occupancy issued for the Building or the Project, and shall, upon five (5) days’ written notice from Landlord, discontinue any use of the Premises that is declared or claimed by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be a violation of</p>
          <p id="s1p133">12</p>
          <p id="s1p134">any of the above, or that in Landlord’s reasonable opinion violates any of the above. Tenant shall comply with any direction of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction that shall, by reason of the nature of Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, impose any duty upon Tenant or Landlord with respect to the Premises or with respect to the use or occupation thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">12.3. Tenant shall not do or permit to be done anything that will invalidate or increase the cost of any fire, environmental, extended coverage or any other insurance policy covering the Building or the Project, and shall comply with all rules, orders, regulations and requirements of the insurers of the Building and the Project, and Tenant shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for any additional premium charged for such policy by reason of Tenant’s failure to comply with the provisions of this Article.</p>
          <p id="s1p136">12.4. Tenant shall keep all doors opening onto public corridors closed, except when in use for ingress and egress.</p>
          <p id="s1p137">12.5. No additional locks or bolts of any kind shall be placed upon any of the doors or windows by Tenant, nor shall any changes be made to existing locks or the mechanisms thereof without Landlord’s prior written consent. Tenant shall, upon termination of this Lease, return to Landlord all keys to offices and restrooms either furnished to or otherwise procured by Tenant. In the event any key so furnished to Tenant is lost, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the cost of replacing the same or of changing the lock or locks opened by such lost key if Landlord shall deem it necessary to make such change.</p>
          <p id="s1p138">12.6. No awnings or other projections shall be attached to any outside wall of the Building. No curtains, blinds, shades or screens shall be attached to or hung in, or used in connection with, any window or door of the Premises other than Landlord’s standard window coverings. Neither the interior nor exterior of any windows shall be coated or otherwise sunscreened without Landlord’s prior written consent, nor shall any bottles, parcels or other articles be placed on the windowsills. No equipment, furniture or other items of personal property shall be placed on any exterior balcony without Landlord’s prior written consent.</p>
          <p id="s1p139">12.7. No sign, advertisement or notice (“Signage”) shall be exhibited, painted or affixed by Tenant on any part of the Premises or the Building without Landlord’s prior written consent. Signage shall conform to Landlord’s design criteria. For any Signage, Tenant shall, at Tenant’s own cost and expense, (a) acquire all permits for such Signage in compliance with Applicable Laws and (b) design, fabricate, install and maintain such Signage in a first-class condition. Tenant shall be responsible for reimbursing Landlord for costs incurred by Landlord in removing any of Tenant’s Signage upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease. Interior signs on doors and the directory tablet shall be inscribed, painted or affixed for Tenant by Landlord at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, and shall be of a size, color and type and be located in a place acceptable to Landlord. The directory tablet shall be provided exclusively for the display of the name and location of tenants only. Tenant shall not place anything on the exterior of the corridor walls or corridor doors other than Landlord’s standard lettering. At Landlord’s option, Landlord may install any Tenant Signage, and Tenant shall pay all costs associated with such installation within thirty (30) days after demand therefor. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to install exterior Building signage (which may include Tenant’s registered corporate logo), subject to all applicable laws and Landlord’s reasonable approval. Notwithstanding the</p>
          <p id="s1p140">13</p>
          <p id="s1p141">foregoing, Landlord, at its sole cost and expense (and not to be included in Operating Expenses), shall provide Tenant with Building standard Signage on all Building directories and at the entrance to the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p142">12.8. Tenant shall only place equipment within the Premises with floor loading consistent with the Building’s structural design without Landlord’s prior written approval, and such equipment shall be placed in a location designed to carry the weight of such equipment.</p>
          <p id="s1p143">12.9. Tenant shall cause any equipment or machinery to be installed in the Premises so as to reasonably prevent sounds or vibrations therefrom from extending into the Common Areas or other offices in the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p144">12.10. Tenant shall not (a) do or permit anything to be done in or about the Premises that shall in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other tenants or occupants of the Project, or injure or annoy them, (b) use or allow the Premises to be used for immoral, unlawful or objectionable purposes, (c) cause, maintain or permit any nuisance or waste in, on or about the Project or (d) take any other action that would in Landlord’s reasonable determination in any manner adversely affect other tenants’ quiet use and enjoyment of their space or adversely impact their ability to conduct business in a professional and suitable work environment.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">12.11. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, Tenant shall be responsible for all liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with the compliance of the Premises with the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and any state and local accessibility laws, codes, ordinances and rules (collectively, and together with regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the “ADA”), and Tenant shall indemnify, save, defend (at Landlord’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold Landlord and its affiliates, employees, agents and contractors; and any lender, mortgagee or beneficiary (each, a “Lender” and, collectively with Landlord and its affiliates, employees, agents and contractors, the “Landlord Indemnitees”) harmless from and against any demands, claims, liabilities, losses, costs, expenses, actions, causes of action, damages or judgments, and all reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements) incurred in investigating or resisting the same (collectively, “Claims”), excluding consequential damages, arising out of any such failure of the Premises to comply with the ADA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting Tenant’s responsibilities under this Section, at the time of Landlord’s delivery of the Premises, all base building systems (including HVAC, electrical, life safety and plumbing) shall be in good working condition and suitable for laboratory and office uses, the Premises and Building common areas (except for mechanical spaces) will be compliant with the ADA, and the Premises’ demising walls and Common Area corridors will be in compliance with the local municipal building code. This Section (as well as any other provisions of this Lease dealing with indemnification of the Landlord Indemnitees by Tenant shall be deemed to be modified in each case by the insertion in the appropriate place of the following: “except as otherwise provided in Mass.

Tenant shall not introduce anything into the Acid Neutralization Tank (x) in violation of the terms of the MWRA Permit, (y) in violation of Applicable Laws or (z) that would interfere with the proper functioning of the Acid Neutralization Tank. Tenant agrees to reasonably cooperate with Landlord in order to obtain the MWRA Permit and the wastewater treatment operator license.

This Lease is subject to any recorded covenants, conditions or restrictions on the Project or Property (the “CC&amp;Rs”), as the same may be amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time; provided that any such amendments, restatements, supplements or modifications do not materially modify Tenant’s rights or obligations hereunder.

In connection with any such alteration, improvement or repair as described in Subsection 14.4(f), Landlord may erect in the Premises or elsewhere in the Project scaffolding and other structures reasonably required for the alteration, improvement or repair work to be performed. In no event shall Tenant’s Rent abate as a result of Landlord’s activities pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that all such activities shall be conducted in such a manner so as to cause as little interference to Tenant as is reasonably possible. Landlord shall at all times retain a key with which to unlock all of the doors in the Premises. If an emergency necessitates immediate access to the Premises, Landlord may use whatever force is necessary to enter the Premises, and any such entry to the Premises shall not constitute a forcible or unlawful entry to the Premises, a detainer of the Premises, or an eviction of Tenant from the Premises or any portion thereof.</p>

To the extent that Tenant uses more than Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of any utilities, then Tenant shall pay Landlord Tenant’s Share of Operating Expenses to reflect such excess. In the event that the Building or Project is less than fully leased, Tenant acknowledges that Landlord may extrapolate utility usage that varies depending on the occupancy of the Building or Project, as applicable, by dividing (a) the total cost of utility usage by (b) the quotient of (i) the Rentable Area of the Building or Project (as applicable) that is leased divided by (ii) the Rentable Area of the Building or Project (as applicable), then multiplying (y) the resulting quotient ((a) divided by (b)) by (z) ninety-five percent (95%), then multiplying the product ((y) times (z)) by Tenant’s Pro Rata Share.

In the event of such failure, Tenant shall not be entitled to termination of this Lease or any abatement or reduction of Rent, nor shall Tenant be relieved from the operation of any covenant or agreement of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p172">16.3. Tenant shall pay for, prior to delinquency of payment therefor, any utilities and services that may be furnished to the Premises during or, if Tenant occupies the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, after the Term, beyond those utilities provided by Landlord, including telephone, internet service, cable television and other telecommunications, together with any fees, surcharges and taxes thereon.</p>
          <p id="s1p173">16.4. Tenant shall not, without Landlord’s prior written consent, use any device in the Premises (including data processing machines) that will in any way (a) increase the amount of ventilation, air exchange, gas, steam, electricity or water required or consumed in the Premises based upon Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building or Project (as applicable) beyond the existing capacity of the Building or the Project usually furnished or supplied for the use set forth in Section 2.7 or (b) exceed Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building’s or Project’s (as applicable) capacity to provide such utilities or services.</p>
          <p id="s1p174">16.5. If Tenant shall require utilities or services in excess of those usually furnished or supplied for tenants in similar spaces in the Building or the Project by reason of Tenant’s equipment or extended hours of business operations, then Tenant shall first procure Landlord’s consent for the use thereof, which consent Landlord may condition upon the availability of such excess utilities or services, and Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent an amount equal to the cost of providing such excess utilities and services.</p>
          <p id="s1p175">16.6. Upon Landlord’s demand, utilities and services provided to the Premises that are separately metered shall be paid by Tenant directly to the supplier of such utility or service.</p>
          <p id="s1p176">18</p>
          <p id="s1p177">16.7. Landlord shall provide water in Common Areas for lavatory purposes only, which water shall be from the local municipal or similar source; provided, however, that if Landlord determines that Tenant requires, uses or consumes water for any purpose other than ordinary lavatory purposes, Landlord may install, at Landlord’s expense, a water meter and thereby measure Tenant’s water consumption for all purposes. Tenant agrees to pay for water consumed, as shown on said meter, as and when bills are rendered. If Tenant fails to timely make such payments, Landlord may pay such charges and collect the same from Tenant. Any such costs or expenses incurred, or payments made by Landlord for any of the reasons or purposes hereinabove stated, shall be deemed to be Additional Rent payment by Tenant and collectible by Landlord as such. Landlord shall also make available reverse osmosis water, compressed air and vacuum systems for Tenant’s non-exclusive use in the Premises for the duration of the Term. Landlord shall maintain such systems, and the costs incurred by Landlord in connection with the foregoing shall be Operating Expenses hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p178">16.8. Landlord reserves the right to stop service of the elevator, plumbing, ventilation, air conditioning and electric systems, when Landlord deems necessary or desirable, due to accident, emergency or the need to make repairs, alterations or improvements, until such repairs, alterations or improvements shall have been completed, and Landlord shall further have no responsibility or liability for failure to supply elevator facilities, plumbing, ventilation, air conditioning or electric service when prevented from doing so by Force Majeure; a failure by a third party to deliver gas, oil or another suitable fuel supply; or Landlord’s inability by exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain gas, oil or another suitable fuel. Without limiting the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that any covenants on Landlord’s part to furnish any service pursuant to any of the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions or agreements of this Lease, or to perform any act or thing for the benefit of Tenant, shall not be deemed breached if Landlord is unable to furnish or perform the same by virtue of Force Majeure so long as Landlord is diligently pursuing the restoration of the same.</p>
          <p id="s1p179">16.9. The Building has two (2) back-up generators (each a “Generator” and, collectively, the “Generators”). With respect to the portion of the Premises located on the first (1st) floor of the Building, Tenant shall be entitled to use up to its proportionate share of available power from the 250 kW Generator that services the first (1st) floor of the Building on a non-exclusive basis with other Tenants on the first (1st) floor of the Building. With respect to the portion of the Premises located on the second (2nd) floor of the Building, Tenant shall be entitled to use up to its proportionate share of available power from the 350 kW Generator that services the second (2nd) floor of the Building on a non-exclusive basis with other Tenants on the second (2nd) floor of the Building. The cost of maintaining, repairing and replacing the Generators shall constitute Operating Expenses. Landlord expressly disclaims any warranties with regard to the Generators or the installation thereof, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Landlord shall maintain the Generators in good working condition, but shall not be liable for any failure to make any repairs or to perform any maintenance that is an obligation of Landlord unless such failure shall persist for an unreasonable time after Tenant provides Landlord with written notice of the need for such repairs or maintenance. The provisions of Section 16.2 of this Lease shall apply to the Generators.</p>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, Landlord shall have no liability, and Tenant shall have no right or remedy, on account of any interruption or impairment in HVAC services; provided that Landlord diligently endeavors to cure any such interruption or impairment.</p>
          <p id="s1p183">16.11. [Intentionally omitted]</p>
          <p id="s1p184">16.12. The Building is currently serviced by a common laboratory waste sanitary sewer connection from the pH neutralization room on the first (1st) floor of the Building to the municipal sewer line in the street adjacent to the Building. There currently exists a separate acid neutralization tank that is connected to the portion of the Premises located on the first (1st) floor of the Building, as well as to adjacent premises on the first (1st) floor of the Building (the “Acid Neutralization Tank”). Tenant shall have a non-exclusive right to use its proportionate share (based upon the Rentable Area of Premises located on the first (1st) floor of the Building) of the Acid Neutralization Tank in accordance with Applicable Laws in common with other tenants on the first (1st) floor of the Building. Tenant, as a portion of its Operating Expenses, shall reimburse Landlord for all costs, charges and expenses incurred by Landlord from time to time in connection with or arising out of the operation, use, maintenance, repair or refurbishment of the Acid Neutralization Tank, including all clean-up costs relating to the Acid Neutralization Tank (collectively, “Tank Costs”); provided, however, that if the Acid Neutralization Tank is being used by other tenant(s) or occupant(s) of the Building at any time during the Term, then, during such time period, Tenant shall only be obligated to pay its proportionate share of the Tank Costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Acid Neutralization Tank is damaged or repairs to the Acid Neutralization Tank are required as a result of the improper use (including using more than Tenant’s proportionate share) of the Acid Neutralization Tank by Tenant, Tenant shall be responsible for one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of any repairs or replacement required as a result of such improper use by Tenant, regardless of whether the Acid Neutralization Tank is then being used by other tenant(s) or occupant(s) of the Building. Similarly, if the Acid Neutralization Tank is damaged, or if repairs to the Acid Neutralization Tank are required as a result of the improper use of the Acid Neutralization Tank by other tenant(s) or occupant(s) of the Building, then Tenant shall have no responsibility for the cost of any repairs or replacements required as a result of such improper use by such other tenant(s) or occupant(s). Tenant shall indemnify, save, defend (at Landlord’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold the Landlord Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Claims, including (a) diminution in value of the Project or any portion thereof, (b) damages for the loss or restriction on use of rentable or usable space or of any amenity of the Project, (c) damages arising from any adverse impact on marketing of space in the Project or any portion thereof and (d) sums paid in settlement of Claims that arise during or after the Term, in each case as a result of Tenant’s negligent use of the Acid Neutralization Tank. This indemnification by Tenant includes costs incurred in connection with any investigation of site conditions or any clean-up, remediation, removal or restoration required by any Governmental Authority caused by Tenant’s improper use of the Acid Neutralization Tank.</p>

Tenant shall make no alterations, additions or improvements in or to the Premises or engage in any construction, demolition, reconstruction, renovation, or other work (whether major or minor) of any kind in, at, or serving the Premises (“Alterations”) without Landlord’s prior written approval, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition, other than such items that cost less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) and do not affect (a) any structural portions of the Building, including exterior walls, roof, foundation, foundation systems (including barriers and subslab systems), or core of the Building, (b) the exterior of the Building or (c) any Building systems, including elevator, plumbing, air conditioning, heating, electrical, security, life safety and power (“Permitted Alterations”). Tenant shall, in making any such Alterations, use only those architects, contractors, suppliers and mechanics of which Landlord has given prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In seeking Landlord’s approval, Tenant shall provide Landlord, at least fourteen (14) days in advance of any proposed construction, with plans, specifications, bid proposals, certified stamped engineering drawings and calculations by Tenant’s engineer of record or architect or record, (including connections to the Building’s structural system, modifications to the Building’s envelope, non-structural penetrations in slabs or walls, and modifications or tie-ins to life safety systems), work contracts, requests for laydown areas and such other information concerning the nature and cost of the Alterations as Landlord may reasonably request. In no event shall Tenant use or Landlord be required to approve any architects, consultants, contractors, subcontractors or material suppliers that Landlord reasonably believes are likely to cause labor disharmony.</p>

The Premises shall at all times remain the property of Landlord and shall be surrendered to Landlord upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

The provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p195">17.8. Except as to those items listed on Exhibit H attached hereto, all business and trade fixtures, machinery and equipment, built-in furniture and cabinets, together with all additions and accessories thereto, installed in and upon the Premises shall be and remain the property of Landlord and shall not be moved by Tenant at any time during the Term. If Tenant shall fail to remove any of its effects from the Premises prior to termination of this Lease, then Landlord may, at its option, remove the same in any manner that Landlord shall choose and store said effects without liability to Tenant for loss thereof or damage thereto, and Tenant shall pay Landlord, upon demand, any costs and expenses incurred due to such removal and storage or Landlord may, at its sole option and without notice to Tenant, sell such property or any portion thereof at private sale and without legal process for such price as Landlord may obtain and apply the proceeds of such sale against any (a) amounts due by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease and (b) any expenses incident to the removal, storage and sale of said personal property.</p>
          <p id="s1p196">17.9. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article to the contrary, in no event shall Tenant remove any improvement from the Premises as to which Landlord contributed payment, including the Tenant Improvements, without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p197">17.10. Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to Landlord’s reasonable out-of-pocket costs paid to third parties for plan review, coordination, scheduling and supervision thereof. For purposes of payment of such sum, Landlord shall submit to Tenant copies of all bills, invoices and statements covering the costs of such charges. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any extra expenses incurred by Landlord by reason of faulty work done by Tenant or its contractors, or by reason of delays caused by such work, or by reason of inadequate clean-up.</p>

          <p id="s1p204">18.2. Except for services of Landlord, if any, required by Section 18.1, Tenant shall at Tenant’s sole cost and expense maintain and keep the Premises and every part thereof and the Liquid Nitrogen Tank (as defined in the Work Letter) in good condition and repair, damage thereto from ordinary wear and tear excepted. Tenant shall, upon the expiration or sooner termination of the Term, surrender the Premises to Landlord in as good a condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted; and shall, at Landlord’s request, remove all telephone and data systems, wiring and equipment from the Premises, and repair any damage to the Premises caused thereby. Landlord shall have no obligation to alter, remodel, improve, repair, decorate or paint the Premises or any part thereof. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall supply its own janitorial and trash services for the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p205">18.3. Landlord shall not be liable for any failure to make any repairs or to perform any maintenance that is an obligation of Landlord unless such failure shall persist for an unreasonable time after Tenant provides Landlord with written notice of the need of such repairs or maintenance. Tenant waives its rights under Applicable Laws now or hereafter in effect to make repairs at Landlord’s expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">18.4. If any excavation shall be made upon land adjacent to or under the Building, or shall be authorized to be made, Tenant shall afford to the person causing or authorized to cause such excavation, license to enter the Premises for the purpose of performing such work as said person shall reasonably deem necessary or desirable to preserve and protect the Building from injury or damage and to support the same by proper foundations (provided that such does not materially impact Tenant’s business or operations) without any claim for damages or liability against Landlord and without reducing or otherwise affecting Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p207">23</p>
          <p id="s1p208">18.5. This Article relates to repairs and maintenance arising in the ordinary course of operation of the Building and the Project. In the event of a casualty described in Article 24, Article 24 shall apply in lieu of this Article. In the event of eminent domain, Article 25 shall apply in lieu of this Article.</p>
          <p id="s1p209">18.6.

          <p id="s1p210">19. Liens.</p>
          <p id="s1p211">19.1. Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, Tenant shall keep the Premises, the Building and the Project free from any liens arising out of work performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by Tenant. Tenant further covenants and agrees that any mechanic’s lien filed against the Premises, the Building or the Project for work claimed to have been done for, or materials claimed to have been furnished to, shall be discharged or bonded by Tenant within ten (10) days after the filing thereof, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p212">19.2. Should Tenant fail to discharge or bond against any lien of the nature described in Section 19.1, Landlord may, at Landlord’s election, pay such claim or post a bond or otherwise provide security to eliminate the lien as a claim against title, and Tenant shall immediately reimburse Landlord for the costs thereof as Additional Rent. Tenant shall indemnify, save, defend (at Landlord’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold the Landlord Indemnitees harmless from and against any Claims, excluding consequential damages, arising from any such liens, including any administrative, court or other legal proceedings related to such liens.</p>
          <p id="s1p213">19.3. In the event that Tenant leases or finances the acquisition of office equipment, furnishings or other personal property of a removable nature utilized by Tenant in the operation of Tenant’s business, Tenant warrants that any Uniform Commercial Code financing statement shall, upon its face or by exhibit thereto, indicate that such financing statement is applicable only to removable personal property of Tenant located within the Premises. Landlord shall execute and deliver such reasonable documents reasonably requested by Tenant’s lender in connection therewith. In no event shall the address of the Premises, the Building or the Project be furnished on a financing statement without qualifying language as to applicability of the lien only to removable personal property located in an identified suite leased by Tenant. Should any holder of a financing statement record or place of record a financing statement that appears to constitute a lien against any interest of Landlord or against equipment that may be located other than within an identified suite leased by Tenant, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after filing such financing statement, cause (a) a copy of the Lender security agreement or other documents to which the financing statement pertains to be furnished to Landlord to facilitate Landlord’s ability to demonstrate that the lien of such financing statement is not applicable to Landlord’s interest and (b) Tenant’s Lender to amend such financing statement and any other documents of record to clarify that any liens imposed thereby are not applicable to any interest of Landlord in the Premises, the Building or the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p214">24</p>

Any such statement may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of all or any portion of the real property of which the Premises are a part. Tenant’s failure to deliver such statement within such the prescribed time, following additional notice and an additional five (5) business day cure period, shall, at Landlord’s option, constitute a Default (as defined below) under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p216">21. Hazardous Materials.</p>
          <p id="s1p217">21.1. Tenant shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Materials (as defined below) to be brought upon, kept or used in or about the Premises, the Building or the Project in violation of Applicable Laws by Tenant or its employees, agents, contractors or invitees. If Tenant breaches such obligation, or if the presence of Hazardous Materials as a result of such a breach results in contamination of the Project, any portion thereof, or any adjacent property, or if contamination of the Project, any portion thereof, or any adjacent property by Hazardous Materials otherwise occurs during the Term or any extension or renewal hereof or holding over hereunder, then Tenant shall indemnify, save, defend (at Landlord’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold the Landlord Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Claims, including (a) diminution in value of the Project or any portion thereof, (b) damages for the loss or restriction on use of rentable or usable space or of any amenity of the Project, (c) damages arising from any adverse impact on marketing of space in the Project or any portion thereof and (d) sums paid in settlement of Claims that arise during or after the Term as a result of such breach or contamination. This indemnification by Tenant includes costs incurred in connection with any investigation of site conditions or any clean-up, remedial, removal or restoration work required by any Governmental Authority because of Hazardous Materials present in the air, soil or groundwater above, on or under or about the Project. Without limiting the foregoing, if the presence of any Hazardous Materials in, on, under or about the Project, any portion thereof or any adjacent property caused or permitted by Tenant results in any contamination of the Project, any portion thereof or any adjacent property, then Tenant shall promptly take all actions at its sole cost and expense as are necessary to return the Project, any portion thereof or any adjacent property to its respective condition existing prior to the time of such contamination; provided that Landlord’s written approval of such action shall first be obtained, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold; and provided, further, that it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent if such actions could have a material adverse long-term or short-term effect on the Project, any portion thereof or any adjacent property.</p>
          <p id="s1p218">25</p>
          <p id="s1p219">21.2. Landlord acknowledges that it is not the intent of this Article to prohibit Tenant from operating its business for the Permitted Use. Tenant may operate its business according to the custom of Tenant’s industry so long as the use or presence of Hazardous Materials is strictly and properly monitored in accordance with Applicable Laws. As a material inducement to Landlord to allow Tenant to use Hazardous Materials in connection with its business, Tenant agrees to deliver to Landlord prior to the Term Commencement Date a list identifying each type of Hazardous Material to be present at the Project and setting forth any and all governmental approvals or permits required in connection with the presence of such Hazardous Material at the Project (the “Hazardous Materials List”). Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an updated Hazardous Materials List on or prior to each annual anniversary of the Term Commencement Date and shall also deliver an updated Hazardous Materials List before any new Hazardous Materials are brought to the Project. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord true and correct copies of the following documents (hereinafter referred to as the “Documents”) relating to the handling, storage, disposal and emission of Hazardous Materials prior to the Term Commencement Date or, if unavailable at that time, concurrently with the receipt from or submission to any Governmental Authority: permits; approvals; reports and correspondence; storage and management plans; notices of violations of Applicable Laws; plans relating to the installation of any storage tanks to be installed in, on, under or about the Project (provided that installation of storage tanks shall only be permitted after Landlord has given Tenant its written consent to do so, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion); and all closure plans or any other documents required by any and all Governmental Authorities for any storage tanks installed in, on, under or about the Project for the closure of any such storage tanks, including the Liquid Nitrogen Tank (as defined in the Work Letter). Tenant shall not be required, however, to provide Landlord with any portion of the Documents containing information of a proprietary nature, which Documents, in and of themselves, do not contain a reference to any Hazardous Materials or activities related to Hazardous Materials.</p>
          <p id="s1p220">21.3. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 21.121.2 or 21.9, if (a) Tenant or any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee of Tenant has been required by any prior landlord, Lender or Governmental Authority to take material remedial action in connection with Hazardous Materials contaminating a property if the contamination resulted from such party’s action or omission or use of the property in question or (b) Tenant or any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee is subject to a material enforcement order issued by any Governmental Authority in connection with the use, disposal or storage of Hazardous Materials, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion (with respect to any such matter involving Tenant), and it shall not be unreasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any proposed transfer, assignment or subletting (with respect to any such matter involving a proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee).</p>
          <p id="s1p221">21.4. At any time, and from time to time, prior to the expiration of the Term, Landlord shall have the right to conduct appropriate tests of the Project or any portion thereof to demonstrate that Hazardous Materials are present or that contamination has occurred due to Tenant or Tenant’s employees, agents, contractors or invitees. Tenant shall pay all reasonable costs of such tests if such tests reveal that Hazardous Materials exist in the Premises or have been released by Tenant at the Project in violation of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p222">26</p>
          <p id="s1p223">21.5. If underground or other storage tanks storing Hazardous Materials are hereafter placed on the Premises by Tenant (including the Liquid Nitrogen Tank (as defined in the Work Letter)), Tenant shall monitor the storage tanks, maintain appropriate records, implement reporting procedures, properly close any underground storage tanks, and take or cause to be taken all other steps necessary or required under the Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p224">21.6. Tenant shall promptly report to Landlord any actual or suspected presence of mold or water intrusion at the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p225">21.7. Tenant’s obligations under this Article shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease. During any period of time needed by Tenant or Landlord after the termination of this Lease to complete the removal from the Premises of any such Hazardous Materials, Tenant shall be deemed a holdover tenant and subject to the provisions of Article 27 below.</p>
          <p id="s1p226">21.8. As used herein, the term “Hazardous Material” means any hazardous or toxic substance, material or waste that is or becomes regulated by any Governmental Authority.</p>
          <p id="s1p227">21.9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Landlord shall have sole control over the equitable allocation of fire control areas (as defined in the Uniform Building Code as adopted by the city or municipality(ies) in which the Project is located (the “UBC”)) within the Project for the storage of Hazardous Materials; provided, however, that Tenant shall be entitled to use of two (2) fire control areas on the first (1st) floor of the Building and one (1) fire control area on the second (2nd) floor of the Building. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, the quantity of Hazardous Materials allowed by this Section 21.9 is specific to Tenant and shall not run with the Lease in the event of a Transfer, other than an Exempt Transfer (as each such term as defined in Article 29). In the event of a Transfer, if the use of Hazardous Materials by such new tenant (“New Tenant”) is such that New Tenant utilizes fire control areas in the Project in excess of New Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Project, then New Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense and upon Landlord’s written request, establish and maintain a separate area of the Premises classified by the UBC as an “H” occupancy area for the use and storage of Hazardous Materials, or take such other action as is necessary to ensure that its share of the fire control areas of the Project is not greater than New Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p228">21.10. Landlord shall indemnify, save, defend (at Tenant’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant) and hold the Tenant Indemnitees (as defined below) harmless from and against any and all Claims arising in connection with the presence, use, generation, storage, release, threatened release, disposal or transport of Hazardous Materials at the Project, the Building or the Premises prior to the Term Commencement Date of this Lease, including costs of any required or necessary repair, clean-up or detoxification and preparation of any closure or other required plans. This agreement to indemnify and hold harmless shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p229">22. Odors, Exhaust and Noise. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord would not enter into this Lease with Tenant unless Tenant assured Landlord that under no circumstances will any other occupants of the Building or the Project (including persons legally present in any outdoor areas</p>
          <p id="s1p230">27</p>
          <p id="s1p231">of the Project) be subjected to odors or fumes (whether or not noxious), and that the Building and the Project will not be damaged by any exhaust, in each case from Tenant’s operations, including in Tenant’s vivarium. Landlord and Tenant therefore agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p232">22.1. Tenant shall not cause or permit (or conduct any activities that would cause) any release of any odors or fumes of any kind from the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p233">22.2. If the Building has a ventilation system that, in Landlord’s judgment, is adequate, suitable, and appropriate to vent the Premises in a manner that does not release odors affecting any indoor or outdoor part of the Project, Tenant shall vent the Premises through such system. If Landlord at any time determines that any existing ventilation system is inadequate, or if no ventilation system exists, Tenant shall in compliance with Applicable Laws vent all fumes and odors from the Premises (and remove odors from Tenant’s exhaust stream) as Landlord requires. The placement and configuration of all ventilation exhaust pipes, louvers and other equipment shall be subject to Landlord’s approval. Tenant acknowledges Landlord’s legitimate desire to maintain the Project (indoor and outdoor areas) in an odor-free manner, and Landlord may require Tenant to abate and remove all odors in a manner that goes beyond the requirements of Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p234">22.3. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, provide odor eliminators and other devices (such as filters, air cleaners, scrubbers and whatever other equipment may in Landlord’s judgment be necessary or appropriate from time to time) to completely remove, eliminate and abate any odors, fumes or other substances in Tenant’s exhaust stream that, in Landlord’s judgment, emanate from Tenant’s Premises. Any work Tenant performs under this Section shall constitute Alterations.</p>
          <p id="s1p235">22.4. Tenant’s responsibility to remove, eliminate and abate odors, fumes and exhaust shall continue throughout the Term. Landlord’s approval of the Tenant Improvements shall not preclude Landlord from requiring additional measures to eliminate odors, fumes and other adverse impacts of Tenant’s exhaust stream (as Landlord may designate in Landlord’s discretion). Tenant shall install additional equipment as Landlord requires from time to time under the preceding sentence. Such installations shall constitute Alterations.</p>
          <p id="s1p236">22.5. If Tenant fails to install satisfactory odor control equipment within ten (10) business days after Landlord’s demand made at any time, then Landlord may, without limiting Landlord’s other rights and remedies, require Tenant to cease and suspend any operations in the Premises that, in Landlord’s determination, cause odors, fumes or exhaust. For example, if Landlord determines that Tenant’s production of a certain type of product causes odors, fumes or exhaust, and Tenant does not install satisfactory odor control equipment within ten (10) business days after Landlord’s request, then Landlord may require Tenant to stop producing such type of product in the Premises unless and until Tenant has installed odor control equipment satisfactory to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p237">22.6. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord would not enter into this Lease with Tenant unless Tenant assured Landlord that under no circumstances will any other occupants of the Project (including persons legally present in any outdoor areas of the Project) be subjected to any noise from Tenant’s operations affecting the use of the Project by any other tenant. Landlord and Tenant therefore agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p238">(a) Tenant shall not cause or permit (or conduct any activities that would cause or permit) any noise affecting the use of the Project by any other tenant to be emitted from the Premises;</p>
          <p id="s1p239">28</p>
          <p id="s1p240">(b) If Landlord at any time determines that any existing noise control system is inadequate, or if no noise control system exists, Tenant shall install (in compliance with Applicable Laws) such noise control system as Landlord requires. The placement and configuration of the noise control system shall be subject to Landlord’s approval. Tenant acknowledges Landlord’s legitimate desire to maintain the Project (including indoor and outdoor areas) in a quiet and peaceful manner, and Landlord may require Tenant to cease all noises in a manner that goes beyond the requirements of Applicable Laws;</p>
          <p id="s1p241">(c) Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, install a noise control system (such as insulation, wall coverings and whatever other equipment may in Landlord’s judgment be necessary or appropriate from time to time) to completely remove, eliminate and abate any noise that emanates from the Premises. Any work Tenant performs under this Section shall constitute Alterations;</p>
          <p id="s1p242">(d) Landlord’s construction of Landlord’s Work shall not preclude Landlord from requiring additional measures to eliminate sounds from the Premises (as Landlord may designate in Landlord’s discretion); and</p>
          <p id="s1p243">(e) If Tenant fails to install the required noise control system or equipment within ten (10) business days after Landlord’s request, then Landlord may, without limiting Landlord’s other rights and remedies, require Tenant to cease and suspend any operations in the Premises that, in Landlord’s reasonable determination, cause noise in violation of this Article.</p>
          <p id="s1p244">23. Insurance; Waiver of Subrogation.</p>
          <p id="s1p245">23.1. Landlord shall maintain insurance for the Building and the Project in amounts equal to full replacement cost (exclusive of the costs of excavation, foundations and footings, and without reference to depreciation taken by Landlord upon its books or tax returns) or such lesser coverage as Landlord may elect, provided that such coverage shall not be less than ninety percent (90%) of such full replacement cost or the amount of such insurance Landlord’s Lender, if any, requires Landlord to maintain, providing protection against any peril generally included within the classification “Fire and Extended Coverage,” together with insurance against sprinkler damage (if applicable), vandalism and malicious mischief. Landlord, subject to availability thereof, shall further insure, if Landlord deems it appropriate, coverage against flood, environmental hazard, earthquake, loss or failure of building equipment, rental loss during the period of repairs or rebuilding, workmen’s compensation insurance and fidelity bonds for employees employed to perform services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may, but shall not be deemed required to, provide insurance for any improvements installed by Tenant or that are in addition to the standard improvements customarily furnished by Landlord, without regard to whether or not such are made a part of or are affixed to the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p246">29</p>
          <p id="s1p247">23.2. In addition, Landlord shall carry public liability insurance with a single limit of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for death or bodily injury, or property damage with respect to the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p248">23.3. Tenant shall, at its own cost and expense, procure and maintain in effect, beginning on the Term Commencement Date or the date of occupancy, whichever occurs first, and continuing throughout the Term (and occupancy by Tenant, if any, after termination of this Lease) comprehensive public liability insurance with limits of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) per occurrence for death or bodily injury and for property damage with respect to the Premises (including $100,000 fire legal liability (each loss)).</p>
          <p id="s1p249">23.4. The insurance required to be purchased and maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall name Landlord, BioMed Realty, L.P., BioMed Realty Trust, Inc. and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, general partners, members, subsidiaries, affiliates and Lenders (“Landlord Parties”) as additional insureds. Said insurance shall be with companies authorized to do business in the state in which the Project is located and having a rating of not less than policyholder rating of A and financial category rating of at least Class XII in “Best’s Insurance Guide.” Tenant shall obtain for Landlord from the insurance companies or cause the insurance companies to furnish certificates of coverage to Landlord. No such policy shall be cancelable or subject to reduction of coverage or other modification or cancellation except after thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Landlord from the insurer (except in the event of non-payment of premium, in which case ten (10) days written notice shall be given). All such policies shall be written as primary policies, not contributing with and not in excess of the coverage that Landlord may carry. Tenant’s policy may be a “blanket policy” that specifically provides that the amount of insurance shall not be prejudiced by other losses covered by the policy. Tenant shall, at least twenty (20) days prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Landlord with renewals or binders. Tenant agrees that if Tenant does not take out and maintain such insurance, Landlord may (but shall not be required to) procure said insurance on Tenant’s behalf and at its cost to be paid by Tenant as Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p250">23.5. Tenant assumes the risk of damage to any fixtures, goods, inventory, merchandise, equipment and leasehold improvements, and Landlord shall not be liable for injury to Tenant’s business or any loss of income therefrom, relative to such damage, all as more particularly set forth within this Lease. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, carry such insurance as Tenant desires for Tenant’s protection with respect to personal property of Tenant or business interruption.</p>
          <p id="s1p251">23.6. In each instance where insurance is to name Landlord Parties as additional insureds, Tenant shall, upon Landlord’s written request, also designate and furnish certificates evidencing such Landlord Parties as additional insureds to (a) any Lender of Landlord holding a security interest in the Building, the Property or the Project, (b) the landlord under any lease whereunder Landlord is a tenant of the Property if the interest of Landlord is or shall become that of a tenant under a ground lease rather than that of a fee owner and (c) any management company retained by Landlord to manage the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p252">23.7. Landlord and Tenant each hereby waive any and all rights of recovery against the other or against the officers, directors, employees, agents, general partners, members,</p>
          <p id="s1p253">30</p>
          <p id="s1p254">subsidiaries, affiliates and Lenders of the other on account of loss or damage occasioned by such waiving party or its property or the property of others under such waiving party’s control, in each case to the extent that such loss or damage is insured against under any fire and extended coverage insurance policy that either Landlord or Tenant may have in force at the time of such loss or damage. Such waivers shall continue so long as their respective insurers so permit. Any termination of such a waiver shall be by written notice to the other party, containing a description of the circumstances hereinafter set forth in this Section. Landlord and Tenant, upon obtaining the policies of insurance required or permitted under this Lease, shall give notice to the insurance carrier or carriers that the foregoing mutual waiver of subrogation is contained in this Lease. If such policies shall not be obtainable with such waiver or shall be so obtainable only at a premium over that chargeable without such waiver, then the party seeking such policy shall notify the other of such conditions, and the party so notified shall have ten (10) days thereafter to either (a) procure such insurance with companies reasonably satisfactory to the other party or (b) agree to pay such additional premium (in Tenant’s case, in the proportion that the area of the Premises bears to the insured area). If the parties do not accomplish either (a) or (b), then this Section shall have no effect during such time as such policies shall not be obtainable or the party in whose favor a waiver of subrogation is desired refuses to pay the additional premium. If such policies shall at any time be unobtainable, but shall be subsequently obtainable, then neither party shall be subsequently liable for a failure to obtain such insurance until a reasonable time after notification thereof by the other party. If the release of either Landlord or Tenant, as set forth in the first sentence of this Section, shall contravene Applicable Laws, then the liability of the party in question shall be deemed not released but shall be secondary to the other party’s insurer.</p>
          <p id="s1p255">23.8. Landlord may require insurance policy limits required under this Lease to be raised to conform with reasonable requirements of Landlord’s Lender.</p>
          <p id="s1p256">23.9. Any costs incurred by Landlord pursuant to this Article shall constitute a portion of Operating Expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p257">24. Damage or Destruction.</p>
          <p id="s1p258">24.1. In the event of a partial destruction of (a) the Premises or (b) Common Areas of the Building or the Project ((a) and (b) together, the “Affected Areas”) by fire or other perils covered by extended coverage insurance not exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of the full insurable value thereof, and provided that (x) the damage thereto is such that the Affected Areas may be repaired, reconstructed or restored within a period of six (6) months from the date of the happening of such casualty, (y) Landlord shall receive insurance proceeds sufficient to cover the cost of such repairs (except for any deductible amount provided by Landlord’s policy, which deductible amount, if paid by Landlord, shall constitute an Operating Expense) and (z) such casualty was not intentionally caused by Tenant or its employees, agents or contractors, then Landlord shall commence and proceed diligently with the work of repair, reconstruction and restoration of the Affected Areas and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p259">24.2. In the event of any damage to or destruction of the Building or the Project other than as described in Section 24.1, Landlord may elect to repair, reconstruct and restore the Building or the Project, as applicable, in which case this Lease shall continue in full force and</p>
          <p id="s1p260">31</p>
          <p id="s1p261">effect. If Landlord elects not to repair the Building or the Project, as applicable, then this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such damage or destruction, except for those provisions that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p262">24.3. Landlord shall give written notice to Tenant within sixty (60) days following the date of damage or destruction of its election not to repair, reconstruct or restore the Building or the Project, as applicable. If Landlord elects not to terminate this Lease pursuant to Section 24.2 and (a) there are twelve (12) or fewer months remaining in the Term or (b) Landlord does not in good faith believe that the repairs, reconstruction and restoration will be completed within twelve (12) months after the date of the damage or destruction, then Tenant may terminate this Lease as of the date of the damage or destruction, except for those provisions that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p263">24.4. Upon any termination of this Lease under any of the provisions of this Article, the parties shall be released thereby without further obligation to the other from the date possession of the Premises is surrendered to Landlord, except with regard to (a) items occurring prior to the damage or destruction and (b) provisions of this Lease that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p264">24.5. In the event of repair, reconstruction and restoration as provided in this Article, all Rent to be paid by Tenant under this Lease shall be abated proportionately based on the extent to which Tenant’s use of the Premises is impaired during the period of such repair, reconstruction or restoration, unless Landlord provides Tenant with other space during the period of repair that, in Tenant’s reasonable opinion, is suitable for the temporary conduct of Tenant’s business; provided, however, that the amount of such abatement shall be reduced by the proceeds of business interruption or loss of rental income insurance actually received by Tenant with respect to the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p265">24.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article, should Landlord be delayed or prevented from completing the repair, reconstruction or restoration of the damage or destruction to the Premises after the occurrence of such damage or destruction by Force Majeure, then the time for Landlord to commence or complete repairs shall be extended on a day-for-day basis; provided, however, that, at Landlord’s election, Landlord shall be relieved of its obligation to make such repair, reconstruction or restoration, in which case this Lease shall terminate as of the date of the damage or destruction, except for those provisions that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p266">24.7. If Landlord is obligated to or elects to repair, reconstruct or restore as herein provided, then Landlord shall be obligated to make such repair, reconstruction or restoration only with regard to (a) those portions of the Premises that were originally provided at Landlord’s expense and (b) the Common Area portion of the Affected Areas. The repair, reconstruction or restoration of improvements not originally provided by Landlord or at Landlord’s expense shall be the obligation of Tenant. In the event Tenant has elected to upgrade certain improvements from the Building Standard, Landlord shall, upon the need for replacement due to an insured loss, provide only the Building Standard, unless Tenant again elects to upgrade such improvements and pay any incremental costs related thereto, except to the extent that excess insurance proceeds, if received, are adequate to provide such upgrades, in addition to providing for basic repair, reconstruction and restoration of the Premises, the Building and the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p267">32</p>
          <p id="s1p268">24.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article, Landlord shall not have any obligation whatsoever to repair, reconstruct or restore the Premises if the damage resulting from any casualty covered under this Article occurs during the last twenty-four (24) months of the Term or any extension hereof, or to the extent that insurance proceeds are not available therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p269">24.9. Landlord’s obligation, should it elect or be obligated to repair or rebuild, shall be limited to the Affected Areas. Tenant shall, at its expense, replace or fully repair all of Tenant’s personal property and any Alterations installed by Tenant existing at the time of such damage or destruction. If Affected Areas are to be repaired in accordance with the foregoing, Landlord shall make available to Tenant any portion of insurance proceeds it receives that are allocable to the Alterations constructed by Tenant pursuant to this Lease; provided Tenant is not then in default under this Lease, and subject to the requirements of any Lender of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p270">25. Eminent Domain.</p>
          <p id="s1p271">25.1. In the event (a) the whole of all Affected Areas or (b) such part thereof as shall substantially interfere with Tenant’s use and occupancy of the Premises for the Permitted Use shall be taken for any public or quasi-public purpose by any lawful power or authority by exercise of the right of appropriation, condemnation or eminent domain, or sold to prevent such taking, Tenant or Landlord may terminate this Lease effective as of the date possession is required to be surrendered to said authority, except with regard to (y) items occurring prior to the damage or destruction and (z) provisions of this Lease that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p272">25.2. In the event of a partial taking of (a) the Building or the Project or (b) drives, walkways or parking areas serving the Building or the Project for any public or quasi-public purpose by any lawful power or authority by exercise of right of appropriation, condemnation, or eminent domain, or sold to prevent such taking, then, without regard to whether any portion of the Premises occupied by Tenant was so taken, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease (except with regard to (a) items occurring prior to the damage or destruction and (b) provisions of this Lease that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination hereof) as of such taking if such taking is, in Landlord’s sole opinion, of a material nature such as to make it uneconomical to continue use of the unappropriated portion for purposes of renting office or laboratory space.</p>
          <p id="s1p273">25.3. Tenant shall be entitled to any award that is specifically awarded as compensation for (a) the taking of Tenant’s personal property that was installed at Tenant’s expense and (b) the costs of Tenant moving to a new location. Except as set forth in the previous sentence, any award for such taking shall be the property of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p274">25.4. If, upon any taking of the nature described in this Article, this Lease continues in effect, then Landlord shall promptly proceed to restore the Affected Areas to substantially their same condition prior to such partial taking. To the extent such restoration is infeasible, as determined by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion, the Rent shall be decreased proportionately to reflect the loss of any portion of the Premises no longer available to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p275">33</p>
          <p id="s1p276">26. Surrender.</p>
          <p id="s1p277">26.1. At least ten (10) days prior to Tenant’s surrender of possession of any part of the Premises, Tenant shall provide Landlord with (a) a facility decommissioning and Hazardous Materials closure plan for the Premises (“Exit Survey”) prepared by an independent third party reasonably acceptable to Landlord, and (b) written evidence of all appropriate governmental releases obtained by Tenant in accordance with Applicable Laws, including laws pertaining to the surrender of the Premises. In addition, Tenant agrees to remain responsible after the surrender of the Premises for the remediation of any recognized environmental conditions set forth in the Exit Survey and compliance with any recommendations set forth in the Exit Survey. Tenant’s obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p278">26.2. No surrender of possession of any part of the Premises shall release Tenant from any of its obligations hereunder, unless such surrender is accepted in writing by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p279">26.3. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant shall not effect a merger with Landlord’s fee title or leasehold interest in the Premises, the Building, the Property or the Project, unless Landlord consents in writing, and shall, at Landlord’s option, operate as an assignment to Landlord of any or all subleases.</p>
          <p id="s1p280">26.4. The voluntary or other surrender of any ground or other underlying lease that now exists or may hereafter be executed affecting the Building or the Project, or a mutual cancellation thereof or of Landlord’s interest therein by Landlord and its lessor shall not effect a merger with Landlord’s fee title or leasehold interest in the Premises, the Building or the Property and shall, at the option of the successor to Landlord’s interest in the Building or the Project, as applicable, operate as an assignment of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p281">27. Holding Over.</p>
          <p id="s1p282">27.1. If, with Landlord’s prior written consent, Tenant holds possession of all or any part of the Premises after the Term, Tenant shall become a tenant from month to month after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, and in such case Tenant shall continue to pay (a) Base Rent in accordance with Article 7, as adjusted in accordance with Article 8, and (b) any amounts for which Tenant would otherwise be liable under this Lease if the Lease were still in effect, including payments for Tenant’s Share of Operating Expenses. Any such month-to-month tenancy shall be subject to every other term, covenant and agreement contained herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p283">27.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term without Landlord’s prior written consent, (a) Tenant shall become a tenant at sufferance subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease, except that the monthly rent shall be equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Rent in effect during the last thirty (30) days of the Term, and (b) Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for any and all damages suffered by Landlord as a result of such holdover, including any lost rent or consequential, special and indirect damages.</p>
          <p id="s1p284">34</p>
          <p id="s1p285">27.3. Acceptance by Landlord of Rent after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term shall not result in an extension, renewal or reinstatement of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p286">27.4. The foregoing provisions of this Article are in addition to and do not affect Landlord’s right of reentry or any other rights of Landlord hereunder or as otherwise provided by Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p287">28. Indemnification and Exculpation.</p>
          <p id="s1p288">28.1. Subject to Section 23.7, Tenant agrees to indemnify, save, defend (at Landlord’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold the Landlord Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Claims, excluding consequential damages (unless otherwise specified in this Lease), arising from injury or death to any person or damage to any property occurring within or about the Premises, the Building, the Property or the Project arising directly or indirectly out of Tenant’s or Tenant’s employees’, agents’, contractors’ or invitees’ use or occupancy of the Premises or a breach or default by Tenant in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent caused by Landlord’s or Landlord Indemnitees’ negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
          <p id="s1p289">28.2. Subject to Sections 23.7, 28.3 and 31.12 and any subrogation provisions contained in the Work Letter, Landlord agrees to indemnify, save, defend (at Tenant’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant) and hold Tenant and its affiliates, members, employees, agents and contractors (the “Tenant Indemnitees”) harmless from and against any and all Claims, excluding consequential damages, arising from injury or death to any person or damage to any property occurring within or about the Premises, the Building, the Property or the Project arising directly or indirectly out of Landlord’s or Landlord’s employees’, agents’, contractors’ or invitees’ gross negligence or willful misconduct, except to the extent caused by Tenant’s or Tenant Indemnitees’ negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
          <p id="s1p290">28.3. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 28.1 to the contrary, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant assumes all risk of, damage to personal property or scientific research, including loss of records kept by Tenant within the Premises and damage or losses caused by fire, electrical malfunction, gas explosion or water damage of any type (including broken water lines, malfunctioning fire sprinkler systems, roof leaks or stoppages of lines), unless any such loss is due to Landlord’s willful disregard of written notice by Tenant of need for a repair that Landlord is responsible to make for an unreasonable period of time. Tenant further waives any claim for injury to Tenant’s business or loss of income relating to any such damage or destruction of personal property as described in this Section.</p>
          <p id="s1p291">28.4. Landlord shall not be liable for any damages arising from any act, omission or neglect of any other tenant in the Building or the Project, or of any other third party.</p>
          <p id="s1p292">28.5. Tenant acknowledges that security devices and services, if any, while intended to deter crime, may not in given instances prevent theft or other criminal acts. Landlord shall not be liable for injuries or losses caused by criminal acts of third parties, and Tenant assumes the risk that any security device or service may malfunction or otherwise be circumvented by a criminal. If Tenant desires protection against such criminal acts, then Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, obtain appropriate insurance coverage.</p>
          <p id="s1p293">28.6. The provisions of this Article shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p294">35</p>
          <p id="s1p295">29. Assignment or Subletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p296">29.1. Except as hereinafter expressly permitted, Tenant shall not, either voluntarily or by operation of Applicable Laws, directly or indirectly sell, hypothecate, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise transfer this Lease, or sublet the Premises (each, a “Transfer”), without Landlord’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to Transfer without Landlord’s prior written consent the Premises or any part thereof to (a) any person that as of the date of determination and at all times thereafter directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Tenant (“Tenant’s Affiliate”), or (b) any entity that succeeds to Tenant’s interest in this Lease by reason of merger, spin-off, acquisition (whereby the spin-off or acquisition consists of all or substantially all of Tenant’s stock or assets) or consolidation (“Tenant’s Successor”), provided that (m) Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the effectiveness of such Transfer to Tenant’s Affiliate or Tenant’s Successor (each an “Exempt Transfer”), (n) if Tenant ceases to exist as an ongoing business as a result of such Exempt Transfer, Tenant’s Successor must have a net worth equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant as of the date immediately preceding such Transfer and (o) Tenant shall otherwise comply with the requirements of this Lease regarding such Transfer. For purposes of an Exempt Transfer to Tenant’s Affiliate, “control” requires both (y) owning (directly or indirectly) more than fifty percent (50%) of the stock or other equity interests of another person and (z) possessing, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person. In no event shall Tenant perform a Transfer (other than an Exempt Transfer) to or with an entity that is a tenant at the Project or that is in discussions or negotiations with Landlord or an affiliate of Landlord to lease premises at the Project (unless comparable space in the Building is not then available for lease from Landlord).</p>
          <p id="s1p297">29.2. In the event Tenant desires to effect a Transfer, then, (a) in the case of Transfers other than Exempt Transfers, at least thirty (30) but not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date when Tenant desires the assignment or sublease to be effective or (b) in the case of Exempt Transfers, at least ten (10) days prior to the date when Tenant desires the assignment or sublease to be effective (the “Transfer Date”), Tenant shall provide written notice to Landlord (the “Transfer Notice”) containing information (including references) concerning the character of the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee; the Transfer Date; any ownership or commercial relationship between Tenant and the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee; in the case of Exempt Transfers, the reason such Transfer is an Exempt Transfer; and in the case of Transfers other than Exempt Transfers, the consideration and all other material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer; all in such detail as Landlord shall reasonably require.</p>
          <p id="s1p298">29.3. Landlord, in determining whether consent should be given to a proposed Transfer, may give consideration to (a) the financial strength of such transferee, assignee or sublessee</p>
          <p id="s1p299">36</p>
          <p id="s1p300">(notwithstanding Tenant remaining liable for Tenant’s performance), (b) any change in use that such transferee, assignee or sublessee proposes to make in the use of the Premises and (c) Landlord’s desire to exercise its rights under Section 29.8 to cancel this Lease with respect to the portion of the Premises being sublet. In no event shall Landlord be deemed to be unreasonable for declining to consent to a Transfer to a transferee, assignee or sublessee of poor reputation, lacking financial qualifications or seeking a change in the Permitted Use, or jeopardizing directly or indirectly the status of Landlord or any of Landlord’s affiliates as a Real Estate Investment Trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Revenue Code”). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, (w) no Transfer shall be consummated on any basis such that the rental or other amounts to be paid by the occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee thereunder would be based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits derived by the business activities of such occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee; (x) Tenant shall not furnish or render any services to an occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee with respect to whom transfer consideration is required to be paid, or manage or operate the Premises or any capital additions so transferred, with respect to which transfer consideration is being paid; (y) Tenant shall not consummate a Transfer with any person in which Landlord owns an interest, directly or indirectly (by applying constructive ownership rules set forth in Section 856(d)(5) of the Revenue Code); and (z) Tenant shall not consummate a Transfer with any person or in any manner that could cause any portion of the amounts received by Landlord pursuant to this Lease or any sublease, license or other arrangement for the right to use, occupy or possess any portion of the Premises to fail to qualify as “rents from real property” within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Revenue Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto or which could cause any other income of Landlord to fail to qualify as income described in Section 856(c)(2) of the Revenue Code.</p>
          <p id="s1p301">29.4. As conditions precedent to Tenant subleasing the Premises or to Landlord considering a request by Tenant to Tenant’s transfer of rights or sharing of the Premises, Landlord may require any or all of the following; provided that only (a), (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l) and (m) below shall apply to Exempt Transfers:</p>
          <p id="s1p302">(a) Tenant shall remain fully liable under this Lease during the unexpired Term;</p>
          <p id="s1p303">(b) Tenant shall provide Landlord with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord that the value of Landlord’s interest under this Lease shall not be diminished or reduced by the proposed Transfer. Such evidence shall include evidence respecting the relevant business experience and financial responsibility and status of the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee;</p>
          <p id="s1p304">(c) Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord’s actual costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements incurred in connection with the review, processing and documentation of such request, not to exceed Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500);</p>
          <p id="s1p305">(d) If Tenant’s transfer of rights or sharing of the Premises provides for the receipt by, on behalf of or on account of Tenant of any consideration of any kind whatsoever (including a premium rental for a sublease or lump sum payment for an assignment, but</p>
          <p id="s1p306">37</p>
          <p id="s1p307">excluding Tenant’s reasonable costs in marketing and subleasing the Premises) in excess of the rental and other charges due to Landlord under this Lease, Tenant shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all of such excess to Landlord, after making deductions for any reasonable marketing expenses, tenant improvement funds expended by Tenant, alterations, cash concessions, brokerage commissions, attorneys’ fees, architectural and engineering fees, and free rent actually paid by Tenant. If said consideration consists of cash paid to Tenant, payment to Landlord shall be made upon receipt by Tenant of such cash payment;</p>
          <p id="s1p308">(e) The proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall agree that, in the event Landlord gives such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee notice that Tenant is in default under this Lease, such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall thereafter make all payments otherwise due Tenant directly to Landlord, which payments shall be received by Landlord without any liability being incurred by Landlord, except to credit such payment against those due by Tenant under this Lease, and any such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall agree to attorn to Landlord or its successors and assigns should this Lease be terminated for any reason; provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord or its Lenders, successors or assigns be obligated to accept such attornment;</p>
          <p id="s1p309">(f) Landlord’s consent to any such Transfer shall be effected on Landlord’s forms;</p>
          <p id="s1p310">(g) Tenant shall not then be in default hereunder in any respect;</p>
          <p id="s1p311">(h) Such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee’s use of the Premises shall be the same as the Permitted Use;</p>
          <p id="s1p312">(i) Landlord shall not be bound by any provision of any agreement pertaining to the Transfer, except for Landlord’s written consent to the same;</p>
          <p id="s1p313">(j) Tenant shall pay all transfer and other taxes (including interest and penalties) assessed or payable for any Transfer;</p>
          <p id="s1p314">(k) Any Exempt Transfer or Landlord’s consent (or waiver of its rights) for any other Transfer shall not waive Landlord’s right to consent to any later Transfer;</p>
          <p id="s1p315">(l) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord one executed copy of any and all written instruments evidencing or relating to the Transfer; and</p>
          <p id="s1p316">(m) A list of Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section 21.7), certified by the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee to be true and correct, that the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee intends to use or store in the Premises. Additionally, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord, on or before the date any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee takes occupancy of the Premises, all of the items relating to Hazardous Materials of such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee as described in Section 21.2.</p>
          <p id="s1p317">29.5. Any Transfer that is not in compliance with the provisions of this Article shall be void and shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p318">38</p>
          <p id="s1p319">29.6. The consent by Landlord to a Transfer shall not relieve Tenant or proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee from obtaining Landlord’s consent to any further Transfer, nor shall it release Tenant or any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee of Tenant from full and primary liability under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p320">29.7. Notwithstanding any Transfer, Tenant shall remain fully and primarily liable for the payment of all Rent and other sums due or to become due hereunder, and for the full performance of all other terms, conditions and covenants to be kept and performed by Tenant. The acceptance of Rent or any other sum due hereunder, or the acceptance of performance of any other term, covenant or condition thereof, from any person or entity other than Tenant shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the provisions of this Lease or a consent to any Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p321">29.8. Other than in the case of an Exempt Transfer, if Tenant delivers to Landlord a Transfer Notice indicating a desire to transfer all (or, in the case of subleases only, a portion) of this Lease to a proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee other than as provided within Section 29.4, then Landlord shall have the option, exercisable by giving notice to Tenant at any time within ten (10) days after Landlord’s receipt of such Transfer Notice, to terminate this Lease with respect to such portion of the Premises being sublet as of the date specified in the Transfer Notice as the Transfer Date, except for those provisions that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination hereof. If Landlord exercises such option, then Tenant shall have the right to withdraw such Transfer Notice by delivering to Landlord written notice of such election within five (5) days after Landlord’s delivery of notice electing to exercise Landlord’s option to terminate this Lease or portion hereof. In the event Tenant withdraws the Transfer Notice as provided in this Section, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. No failure of Landlord to exercise its option to terminate this Lease or portion hereof shall be deemed to be Landlord’s consent to a proposed Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p322">29.9. If Tenant sublets the Premises or any portion thereof, Tenant hereby immediately and irrevocably assigns to Landlord, as security for Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, all rent from any such subletting, and appoints Landlord as assignee and attorney-in-fact for Tenant, and Landlord (or a receiver for Tenant appointed on Landlord’s application) may collect such rent and apply it toward Tenant’s obligations under this Lease; provided that, until the occurrence of a Default (as defined below) by Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to collect such rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p323">30. Subordination and Attornment.</p>
          <p id="s1p324">30.1. Provided that Tenant’s possession and quiet enjoyment of the Premises shall not be disturbed so long as Tenant is not in Default, this Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any mortgage, deed of trust, or lease in which Landlord is tenant now or hereafter in force against the Building or the Project and to all advances made or hereafter to be made upon the security thereof without the necessity of the execution and delivery of any further instruments on the part of Tenant to effectuate such subordination.</p>
          <p id="s1p325">30.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall execute and deliver upon demand such further instrument or instruments evidencing such subordination of this Lease to the lien of any such mortgage or mortgages or deeds of trust or lease in which Landlord is tenant as may be</p>
          <p id="s1p326">39</p>
          <p id="s1p327">required by Landlord, which shall include language stating that, so long as Tenant is not in Default, Tenant’s possession and quiet enjoyment of the Premises shall not be disturbed by the Mortgagee (as defined below). If any such mortgagee, beneficiary or landlord under a lease wherein Landlord is tenant (each, a “Mortgagee”) so elects, however, this Lease shall be deemed prior in lien to any such lease, mortgage, or deed of trust upon or including the Premises regardless of date and Tenant shall execute a statement in writing to such effect at Landlord’s request. If Tenant fails to execute any document required from Tenant under this Section within ten (10) business days after written request therefor, Tenant hereby constitutes and appoints Landlord or its special attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver any such document or documents in the name of Tenant. Such power is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.</p>
          <p id="s1p328">30.3. Upon written request of Landlord and opportunity for Tenant to review, Tenant agrees to execute any Lease amendments not materially altering the terms of this Lease, if required by a mortgagee or beneficiary of a deed of trust encumbering real property of which the Premises constitute a part incident to the financing of the real property of which the Premises constitute a part.</p>
          <p id="s1p329">30.4. In the event any proceedings are brought for foreclosure, or in the event of the exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage or deed of trust made by Landlord covering the Premises, Tenant shall at the election of the purchaser at such foreclosure or sale attorn to the purchaser upon any such foreclosure or sale and recognize such purchaser as Landlord under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p330">30.5. Upon request by Tenant and at Tenant’s sole cost, Landlord shall provide a non-disturbance agreement from all future lenders and ground lessors of the Project on such lenders’ or ground lessors’ standard form.</p>
          <p id="s1p331">31. Defaults and Remedies.</p>
          <p id="s1p332">31.1. Late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent and other sums due shall cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which shall be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. Such costs include processing and accounting charges and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any mortgage or trust deed covering the Premises. Therefore, if any installment of Rent due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within three (3) business days after the date such payment is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord (a) an additional sum of six percent (6%) of the overdue Rent as a late charge plus (b) interest at an annual rate (the “Default Rate”) equal to the lesser of (a) twelve percent (12%) and (b) the highest rate permitted by Applicable Laws. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord shall incur by reason of late payment by Tenant and shall be payable as Additional Rent to Landlord due with the next installment of Rent or within five (5) business days after Landlord’s demand, whichever is earlier. Landlord’s acceptance of any Additional Rent (including a late charge or any other amount hereunder) shall not be deemed an extension of the date that Rent is due or prevent Landlord from pursuing any other rights or remedies under this Lease, at law or in equity.</p>
          <p id="s1p333">31.2. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the Rent payment herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than on account of the Rent, nor shall any</p>
          <p id="s1p334">40</p>
          <p id="s1p335">endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as Rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover the balance of such Rent or pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease or in equity or at law. If a dispute shall arise as to any amount or sum of money to be paid by Tenant to Landlord hereunder, Tenant shall have the right to make payment “under protest,” such payment shall not be regarded as a voluntary payment, and there shall survive the right on the part of Tenant to institute suit for recovery of the payment paid under protest.</p>
          <p id="s1p336">31.3. If Tenant fails to pay any sum of money required to be paid by it hereunder, or shall fail to perform any other act on its part to be performed hereunder, in each case within the applicable cure period (if any) described in Section 31.4, then Landlord may, without waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligations of Tenant, but shall not be obligated to, make such payment or perform such act; provided that such failure by Tenant unreasonably interfered with the use of the Building or the Project by any other tenant or with the efficient operation of the Building or the Project, or resulted or could have resulted in a violation of Applicable Laws or the cancellation of an insurance policy maintained by Landlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an emergency, Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises and act in accordance with its rights as provided elsewhere in this Lease. In addition to the late charge described in Section 31.1, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent all sums so paid or incurred by Landlord, together with interest at the Default Rate, computed from the date such sums were paid or incurred.</p>
          <p id="s1p337">31.4. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute a “Default” hereunder by Tenant:</p>
          <p id="s1p338">(a) Tenant abandons the Premises;</p>
          <p id="s1p339">(b) Tenant fails to make any payment of Rent, as and when due, or to satisfy its obligations under Article 19, where such failure shall continue for a period of three (3) business days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant;</p>
          <p id="s1p340">(c) Tenant fails to observe or perform any obligation or covenant contained herein (other than described in Subsections 31.4(a) and 31.4(b)) to be performed by Tenant, where such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant; provided that, if the nature of Tenant’s default is such that it reasonably requires more than thirty (30) days to cure, Tenant shall not be deemed to be in Default if Tenant commences such cure within said thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion; and provided, further, that such cure is completed no later than ninety (90) days after Tenant’s receipt of written notice from Landlord;</p>
          <p id="s1p341">(d) Tenant makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;</p>
          <p id="s1p342">(e) A receiver, trustee or custodian is appointed to or does take title, possession or control of all or substantially all of Tenant’s assets;</p>
          <p id="s1p343">(f) Tenant files a voluntary petition under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any successor statute (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Bankruptcy Code”) or an order for relief is entered against Tenant pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary proceeding commenced under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code;</p>
          <p id="s1p344">41</p>
          <p id="s1p345">(g) Any involuntary petition is filed against Tenant under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code and is not dismissed within one hundred twenty (120) days;</p>
          <p id="s1p346">(h) Tenant fails to deliver an estoppel certificate in accordance with Article 20; or</p>
          <p id="s1p347">(i) Tenant’s interest in this Lease is attached, executed upon or otherwise judicially seized and such action is not released within one hundred twenty (120) days of the action.</p>
          <p id="s1p348">Notices given under this Section shall specify the alleged default and shall demand that Tenant perform the provisions of this Lease or pay the Rent that is in arrears, as the case may be, within the applicable period of time, or quit the Premises. No such notice shall be deemed a forfeiture or a termination of this Lease unless Landlord elects otherwise in such notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p349">31.5. In the event of a Default by Tenant, and at any time thereafter, with or without notice or demand and without limiting Landlord in the exercise of any right or remedy that Landlord may have, Landlord has the right to do any or all of the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p350">(a) Halt any Tenant Improvements and Alterations and order Tenant’s contractors, subcontractors, consultants, designers and material suppliers to stop work;</p>
          <p id="s1p351">(b) Terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises by written notice to Tenant or by any lawful means, in which case Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord. In such event, Landlord shall have the immediate right to re-enter and remove all persons and property, and such property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost and for the account of Tenant, all without service of notice or resort to legal process and without being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned thereby; and</p>
          <p id="s1p352">(c) Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord. In such event, Landlord shall have the immediate right to re-enter and remove all persons and property, and such property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost and for the account of Tenant, all without service of notice or resort to legal process and without being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned thereby. In the event that Landlord shall elect to so terminate this Lease, then Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant all damages incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant’s default, including:</p>
          <p id="s1p353">(i) The worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent that had accrued at the time of such termination; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p354">(ii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent that would have accrued during the period commencing with termination of the Lease and</p>
          <p id="s1p355">42</p>
          <p id="s1p356">ending at the time of award exceeds that portion of the loss of Landlord’s rental income from the Premises that Tenant proves to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction could have been reasonably avoided; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p357">(iii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds that portion of the loss of Landlord’s rental income from the Premises that Tenant proves to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction could have been reasonably avoided; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p358">(iv) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or that in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including the cost of restoring the Premises to the condition required under the terms of this Lease, including any rent payments not otherwise chargeable to Tenant (e.g., during any “free” rent period or rent holiday); plus</p>
          <p id="s1p359">(v) At Landlord’s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p360">As used in Subsections 31.5(c)(i) and 31.5(c)(ii), “worth at the time of award” shall be computed by allowing interest at the Default Rate. As used in Subsection 31.5(c)(iii), the “worth at the time of the award” shall be computed by taking the present value of such amount, using the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of the award plus one (1) percentage point.</p>
          <p id="s1p361">31.6. In addition to any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity and under this Lease, Landlord may continue this Lease in effect after Tenant’s Default and abandonment and recover Rent as it becomes due. In addition, Landlord shall not be liable in any way whatsoever for its failure or refusal to relet the Premises. For purposes of this Section, the following acts by Landlord will not constitute the termination of Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises:</p>
          <p id="s1p362">(a) Acts of maintenance or preservation or efforts to relet the Premises, including alterations, remodeling, redecorating, repairs, replacements or painting as Landlord shall reasonably consider advisable for the purpose of reletting the Premises or any part thereof; or</p>
          <p id="s1p363">(b) The appointment of a receiver upon the initiative of Landlord to protect Landlord’s interest under this Lease or in the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p364">Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Default by Tenant, Landlord may elect at any time to terminate this Lease and to recover damages to which Landlord is entitled.</p>
          <p id="s1p365">31.7. If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as provided in Section 31.5, then Landlord may, from time to time, recover all Rent as it becomes due under this Lease. At any time thereafter, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease and to recover damages to which Landlord is entitled.</p>
          <p id="s1p366">43</p>
          <p id="s1p367">31.8. In the event Landlord elects to terminate this Lease and relet the Premises, Landlord may execute any new lease in its own name. Tenant hereunder shall have no right or authority whatsoever to collect any Rent from such tenant. The proceeds of any such reletting shall be applied as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p368">(a) First, to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord, including storage charges or brokerage commissions owing from Tenant to Landlord as the result of such reletting;</p>
          <p id="s1p369">(b) Second, to the payment of the reasonable costs and expenses of reletting the Premises, including (i) alterations and repairs that Landlord deems reasonably necessary and advisable and (ii) reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements incurred by Landlord in connection with the retaking of the Premises and such reletting;</p>
          <p id="s1p370">(c) Third, to the payment of Rent and other charges due and unpaid hereunder; and</p>
          <p id="s1p371">(d) Fourth, to the payment of future Rent and other damages payable by Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p372">31.9. All of Landlord’s rights, options and remedies hereunder shall be construed and held to be nonexclusive and cumulative. Landlord shall have the right to pursue any one or all of such remedies, or any other remedy or relief that may be provided by Applicable Laws, whether or not stated in this Lease. No waiver of any default of Tenant hereunder shall be implied from any acceptance by Landlord of any Rent or other payments due hereunder or any omission by Landlord to take any action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall affect defaults other than as specified in said waiver.</p>
          <p id="s1p373">31.10. Landlord’s termination of (a) this Lease or (b) Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises shall not relieve Tenant of any liability to Landlord that has previously accrued or that shall arise based upon events that occurred prior to the later to occur of (i) the date of Lease termination or (ii) the date Tenant surrenders possession of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p374">31.11. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, Tenant waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future Applicable Laws if Tenant is evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or if Landlord obtains possession of the Premises due to Tenant’s default hereunder or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p375">31.12. Landlord shall not be in default or liable for damages under this Lease unless Landlord fails to perform obligations required of Landlord within a reasonable time, but in no event shall such failure continue for more than thirty (30) days after written notice from Tenant specifying the nature of Landlord’s failure; provided, however, that if the nature of Landlord’s obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for its performance, then Landlord shall not be in default if Landlord commences performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion. In no event shall Tenant have the right to terminate or cancel this Lease or to withhold or abate rent or to set off any Claims against Rent as a result of any default or breach by Landlord of any of its covenants, obligations, representations, warranties or promises hereunder, except as may otherwise be expressly set forth in this Lease.</p>

Tenant shall have two (2) options (each, an “Option”) to extend the Term by three (3) years each as to the entire Premises (and no less than the entire Premises) (each, an “Option Term”) upon the following terms and conditions. Any extension of the Term pursuant to an Option shall be on all the same terms and conditions as this Lease, except as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p436">42.1. Base Rent shall be adjusted on the first (1st) day of an Option Term to a rate equal to the greater of (a) fair market value for laboratory and office space in the Mid-Cambridge submarket of comparable age, quality, level of finish, and proximity to amenities and public transit (“FMV”) and (b) the Base Rent in effect at the expiration of the then-current Term. If Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on the FMV for an Option Term within thirty (30) days after the date on which Tenant notifies Landlord that it is exercising such Option, then, no later than an additional thirty (30) days thereafter (the “Submission Period”), Landlord and Tenant shall each furnish to the other a notice in writing (an “FMV Notice”) stating such party’s estimate of the FMV. Such notices shall be accompanied by a statement from a qualified, licensed real estate appraiser with at least ten (10) years’ experience in the Mid-Cambridge submarket (an “Appraiser”) stating such Appraiser’s opinion of FMV. If only one (1) party’s Appraiser timely submits its opinion of FMV, such FMV shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. If, within twenty (20) days after expiration of the Submission Period, Landlord and Tenant still cannot agree on the FMV, the two (2) Appraisers shall appoint a third qualified, licensed real estate appraiser (the “Referee”) within seven (7) days. If the Appraisers are unable to agree upon the selection of the Referee, then the Referee shall be selected within ten (10) days thereafter from among the Massachusetts panel of qualified Real Estate Industry Arbitrators of the American Arbitrator Association (the “Association”) pursuant to the Real Estate Industry Arbitration rules of the Association. The Referee shall, within thirty (30) days after appointment, render the Referee’s decision as to the FMV, which opinion shall be strictly limited to choosing one of the two determinations made by the Appraisers. The decision by the Referee shall be binding upon</p>
          <p id="s1p437">52</p>
          <p id="s1p438">Landlord and Tenant, and each shall pay for its own appraisal. The cost of the Referee shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant. In determining FMV, Landlord, Tenant and, if applicable, the Appraisers and Referee shall each take into account all relevant factors, including, without limitation, (a) the size of the Premises and length of the Option Term, (b) rent in comparable buildings in the relevant competitive market, including concessions offered to new tenants, such as free rent, tenant improvement allowances, and moving allowances, (c) Tenant’s creditworthiness and (d) the quality and location of the Building and the Project. Base Rent during any Option Term shall be increased on each annual anniversary of the Option Term commencement date by three percent (3%).</p>
          <p id="s1p439">42.2. The Options are not assignable separate and apart from this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p440">42.3. An Option is conditional upon Tenant giving Landlord written notice of its election to exercise such Option at least nine (9) months prior to the end of the expiration of the then-current Term. Time shall be of the essence as to Tenant’s exercise of an Option. Tenant assumes full responsibility for maintaining a record of the deadlines to exercise an Option. Tenant acknowledges that it would be inequitable to require Landlord to accept any exercise of an Option after the date provided for in this Section.</p>
          <p id="s1p441">42.4. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article to the contrary, Tenant shall not have the right to exercise an Option:</p>
          <p id="s1p442">(a) During the time commencing from the date Landlord delivers to Tenant a written notice that Tenant is in default under any provisions of this Lease and continuing until Tenant has cured the specified default to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction; or</p>
          <p id="s1p443">(b) At any time after any Default as described in Article 31 of the Lease and continuing until Tenant cures any such Default, if such Default is susceptible to being cured; or</p>
          <p id="s1p444">(c) In the event that Tenant has defaulted in the performance of its obligations under this Lease two (2) or more times, and a service or late charge has become payable under Section 31.1 for each of such defaults, during the twelve (12)-month period immediately prior to the date that Tenant intends to exercise an Option, whether or not Tenant has cured such defaults.</p>
          <p id="s1p445">42.5. The period of time within which Tenant may exercise an Option shall not be extended or enlarged by reason of Tenant’s inability to exercise such Option because of the provisions of Section 42.4.</p>
          <p id="s1p446">42.6. All of Tenant’s rights under the provisions of an Option shall terminate and be of no further force or effect even after Tenant’s due and timely exercise of such Option if, after such exercise, but prior to the commencement date of such Option Term, (a) Tenant fails to pay to Landlord a monetary obligation of Tenant for a period of twenty (20) days after written notice from Landlord to Tenant, (b) Tenant fails to commence to cure a default (other than a monetary default) within thirty (30) days after the date Landlord gives notice to Tenant of such default or (c) Tenant has defaulted under this Lease two (2) or more times, and a service or late charge under Section 31.1 has become payable for any such default, during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the commencement date of an Option Term, whether or not Tenant has cured such defaults.</p>

          <p id="s1p448">43. Right of First Offer. Subject to any rights existing as of the Execution Date, Tenant shall have a continuous right of first offer (“ROFO”) as to any rentable premises in the Building for which Landlord is seeking a tenant (“Available ROFO Premises”); provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord be required to lease any Available ROFO Premises to Tenant for any period past the date on which this Lease expires or is terminated pursuant to its terms. To the extent that Landlord renews or extends a then-existing lease with any then-existing tenant of any space, or enters into a new lease for its existing space with such then-existing tenant, the affected space shall not be deemed to be Available ROFO Premises. In the event Landlord intends to market Available ROFO Premises, Landlord shall provide written notice thereof to Tenant setting forth the Base Rent and other material terms upon which it will market such Available ROFO Premises (the “Notice of Marketing”).</p>
          <p id="s1p449">43.1. Within ten (10) business days following its receipt of a Notice of Marketing, Tenant shall advise Landlord in writing whether Tenant elects to lease all (not just a portion) of the Available ROFO Premises on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Marketing (other than the term set forth therein). If Tenant fails to notify Landlord of Tenant’s election within said ten (10) business day period, then Tenant shall be deemed to have elected not to lease the Available ROFO Premises on such terms and conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p450">43.2. If Tenant timely notifies Landlord that Tenant elects to lease all of the Available ROFO Premises on the terms and conditions contained in the Notice of Marketing for at least the remainder of the Term (including any Option Terms), then Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment hereto effecting such terms.</p>
          <p id="s1p451">43.3. If (a) Tenant notifies Landlord that Tenant elects not to lease the Available ROFO Premises or (b) Tenant fails to notify Landlord of Tenant’s election within the ten (10) business-day period described above on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Marketing, then Landlord shall have the right to consummate a lease of the Available ROFO Premises on overall economic terms (taking into account the base rent, tenant improvement allowance, brokerage costs, free rent and all other incentives) not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of that stated in the Notice of Marketing.</p>
          <p id="s1p452">43.4. Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, Tenant shall not exercise the ROFO, and the ROFO shall be deemed not to exist, (a) during such period of time after Tenant has received written notice of a default under any provision of this Lease until such default is timely cured and (b) unless Tenant has at least two (2) years remaining on the Term or Options remain that Tenant is still entitled to exercise. Any attempted exercise of the ROFO shall be void and of no effect during a period of time in which Tenant (y) is so in default (provided that Tenant shall be able to exercise the ROFO following timely cure of such default) or (z) has less than two (2) years remaining on the Term or Options remain that Tenant is still entitled to exercise. In addition, Tenant shall not be entitled to exercise the ROFO in the event that Tenant has defaulted in the performance of its obligations under this Lease two (2) or more times, and a service or late charge has become payable under Section 31.1 for each of such defaults, during the twelve (12)-month period immediately prior to the date on which Tenant seeks to exercise the ROFO, whether or not Tenant has cured such defaults.</p>
          <p id="s1p453">54</p>
          <p id="s1p454">43.5. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not assign or transfer the ROFO separately from any assignment or transfer of Tenant’s interest in the Lease without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p455">43.6. If Tenant exercises the ROFO, Landlord does not guarantee that the Available ROFO Premises will be available on the anticipated commencement date for the Lease as to such Premises due to a holdover by the then-existing occupants of the Available ROFO Premises or for any other reason beyond Landlord’s reasonable control.</p>

All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given them in the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p481">1. General Requirements.</p>
          <p id="s1p482">1.1. Authorized Representatives.</p>
          <p id="s1p483">(a) Landlord designates, as Landlord’s authorized representative (“Landlord’s Authorized Representative”), (a) Sal Zinno as the person authorized to initial plans, drawings and approvals pursuant to this Work Letter and (b) John Bonanno as the person authorized to initial plans, drawings, approvals and to sign change orders pursuant to this Work Letter and any amendments to this Work Letter or the Lease.

Landlord may change either Landlord’s Authorized Representative upon one (1) business day’s prior written notice to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p484">(b) Tenant designates Andrea Franz (“Tenant’s Authorized Representative”) as the person authorized to initial and sign all plans, drawings, change orders and approvals pursuant to this Work Letter.

          <p id="s1p485">1.2. Schedule. The schedule for design and development of the Tenant Improvements, including the time periods for preparation and review of construction documents, approvals and performance, shall be in accordance with a schedule to be prepared by Tenant (the “Schedule”). Tenant shall prepare the Schedule so that it is a reasonable schedule for the completion of the Tenant Improvements. As soon as the Schedule is completed, Tenant shall deliver the same to Landlord for Landlord’s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Such Schedule shall be approved or disapproved by Landlord within ten (10) business days after delivery to Landlord. Landlord’s failure to respond within such ten (10) business day period shall be deemed approval by Landlord. If Landlord disapproves the Schedule, then Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of its objections to such Schedule, and the parties shall confer and negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the Schedule. The Schedule shall be subject to adjustment as mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties, or as provided in this Work Letter.</p>
          <p id="s1p486">B-2</p>
          <p id="s1p487">1.3. Tenant’s Architects, Contractors and Consultants. The architect, engineering consultants, design team, general contractor and principal subcontractors responsible for the construction of the Tenant Improvements shall be selected by Tenant and approved by Landlord, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. Landlord may refuse to use any architects, consultants, contractors, subcontractors or material suppliers that Landlord reasonably believes are likely to cause labor disharmony. All Tenant contracts related to the Tenant Improvements shall provide that Tenant may assign such contracts to Landlord at any time.</p>
          <p id="s1p488">2. Tenant Improvements. All Tenant Improvements shall be performed by Tenant’s contractor, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense (subject to Landlord’s obligations with respect to any portion of the TI Allowance and in accordance with the Approved Plans (as defined below), the Lease and this Work Letter. To the extent that the total projected cost of the Tenant Improvements (as reasonably agreed by Landlord and Tenant) exceeds the TI Allowance (such excess, the “Excess TI Costs”), Tenant shall pay the costs of the Tenant Improvements on a pari passu basis with Landlord as such costs become due, in the proportion of Excess TI Costs payable by Tenant. In the event that the Excess TI Costs are less than projected, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant from the TI Allowance within thirty (30) days after completion of the Tenant Improvements for the amount of Excess TI Costs overpaid by Tenant. If Tenant fails to pay, or is late in paying, any sum due to Landlord under this Work Letter, then Landlord shall have all of the rights and remedies set forth in the Lease for nonpayment of Rent (subject to applicable cure periods in the Lease, and including the right to interest and the right to assess a late charge), and for purposes of any litigation instituted with regard to such amounts the same shall be considered Rent. All material and equipment furnished by Tenant or its contractors as the Tenant Improvements shall be new or “like new;” the Tenant Improvements shall be performed in a first-class, workmanlike manner; and the quality of the Tenant Improvements shall be of a nature and character not less than the Building Standard. Tenant shall take, and shall its contractors to take, commercially reasonable steps to protect the Premises during the performance of any Tenant Improvements, including covering or temporarily removing any window coverings so as to guard against dust, debris or damage. Subject to Landlord’s approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Tenant may install an exhaust duct vertically on the exterior of the east or north side of the Building to support Tenant’s first floor vivarium operation; provided that (a) such duct shall, in Landlord’s reasonable determination, match the façade of the Building, (b) Landlord and Tenant shall reasonably agree on the path and location of the duct and (c) upon Landlord’s request, Tenant shall remove such duct upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease at its sole cost and expense and repair any damage caused thereby. As part of the Tenant Improvements, Tenant may, subject to Applicable Laws and at its sole cost and expense, install a one thousand five hundred (1,500) liter liquid nitrogen tank (the “Liquid Nitrogen Tank”) in the location outlined on Exhibit D attached hereto and, if necessary, Landlord may relocate the bike rack located in that area to another location at Tenant’s sole cost and expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p489">2.1. Work Plans. Tenant shall prepare and submit to Landlord for approval schematics covering the Tenant Improvements prepared in conformity with the applicable provisions of this Work Letter (the “Draft Schematic Plans”). The Draft Schematic Plans shall contain sufficient information and detail to accurately describe the proposed design to Landlord and such other information as Landlord may reasonably request. Landlord shall notify Tenant in</p>
          <p id="s1p490">writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Draft Schematic Plans whether Landlord approves or objects to the Draft Schematic Plans and of the manner, if any, in which the Draft Schematic Plans are unacceptable. Landlord’s failure to respond within such ten (10) business day period shall be deemed approval by Landlord. If Landlord reasonably objects to the Draft Schematic Plans, then Tenant shall revise the Draft Schematic Plans and cause Landlord’s objections to be remedied in the revised Draft Schematic Plans. Tenant shall then resubmit the revised Draft Schematic Plans to Landlord for approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Landlord’s approval of or objection to revised Draft Schematic Plans and Tenant’s correction of the same shall be in accordance with this Section until Landlord has approved the Draft Schematic Plans in writing or been deemed to have approved them. The iteration of the Draft Schematic Plans that is approved or deemed approved by Landlord without objection shall be referred to herein as the “Approved Schematic Plans.”</p>
          <p id="s1p491">2.2. Construction Plans. Tenant shall prepare final plans and specifications for the Tenant Improvements that (a) are consistent with and are logical evolutions of the Approved Schematic Plans and (b) incorporate any other Tenant-requested (and Landlord-approved) Changes (as defined below). As soon as such final plans and specifications (“Construction Plans”) are completed, Tenant shall deliver the same to Landlord for Landlord’s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Such Construction Plans shall be approved or disapproved by Landlord within ten (10) business days after delivery to Landlord. Landlord’s failure to respond within such ten (10) business day period shall be deemed approval by Landlord. If the Construction Plans are disapproved by Landlord, then Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of its objections to such Construction Plans, and the parties shall confer and negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the Construction Plans. Promptly after the Construction Plans are approved by Landlord and Tenant, two (2) copies of such Construction Plans shall be initialed and dated by Landlord and Tenant, and Tenant shall promptly submit such Construction Plans to all appropriate Governmental Authorities for approval. The Construction Plans so approved, and all change orders specifically permitted by this Work Letter, are referred to herein as the “Approved Plans.”</p>
          <p id="s1p492">2.3. Changes to the Tenant Improvements. Any changes to the Approved Plans (each, a “Change”) shall be requested and instituted in accordance with the provisions of this Article 2 and shall be subject to the written approval of the non-requesting party in accordance with this Work Letter.</p>
          <p id="s1p493">(a) Change Request. Either Landlord or Tenant may request Changes after Landlord approves the Approved Plans by notifying the other party thereof in writing in substantially the same form as the AIA standard change order form (a “Change Request”), which Change Request shall detail the nature and extent of any requested Changes, including (a) the Change, (b) the party required to perform the Change and (c) any modification of the Approved Plans and the Schedule, as applicable, necessitated by the Change. If the nature of a Change requires revisions to the Approved Plans, then the requesting party shall be solely responsible for the cost and expense of such revisions and any increases in the cost of the Tenant Improvements as a result of such Change. Change Requests shall be signed by the requesting party’s Authorized Representative.</p>
          <p id="s1p494">(b) Approval of Changes. All Change Requests shall be subject to the other party’s prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The non-requesting party shall have five (5) business days after receipt of a Change Request to notify the requesting party in writing of the non-requesting party’s decision either to approve or object to the Change Request. The non-requesting party’s failure to respond within such five (5) business day period shall be deemed approval by the non-requesting party.</p>
          <p id="s1p495">2.4. Preparation of Estimates. Tenant shall, before proceeding with any Change, using its best efforts, prepare as soon as is reasonably practicable (but in no event more than five (5) business days after delivering a Change Request to Landlord or receipt of a Change Request) an estimate of the increased costs or savings that would result from such Change, as well as an estimate on such Change’s effects on the Schedule. Landlord shall have five (5) business days after receipt of such information from Tenant to (a) in the case of a Tenant-initiated Change Request, approve or reject such Change Request in writing, or (b) in the case of a Landlord-initiated Change Request, notify Tenant in writing of Landlord’s decision either to proceed with or abandon the Landlord-initiated Change Request.</p>
          <p id="s1p496">3. Completion of Tenant Improvements. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense (except for the TI Allowance, shall perform and complete the Tenant Improvements in all respects (a) in substantial conformance with the Approved Plans, (b) otherwise in compliance with provisions of the Lease and this Work Letter and (c) in accordance with Applicable Laws, the requirements of Tenant’s insurance carriers, the requirements of Landlord’s insurance carriers (to the extent Landlord provides its insurance carriers’ requirements to Tenant) and the board of fire underwriters having jurisdiction over the Premises. The Tenant Improvements shall be deemed completed at such time as Tenant shall furnish to Landlord (v) evidence satisfactory to Landlord that (i) all Tenant Improvements have been completed and paid for in full (which shall be evidenced by the architect’s certificate of completion and the general contractor’s and each subcontractor’s and material supplier’s final unconditional waivers and releases of liens, each in a form acceptable to Landlord and complying with Applicable Laws), (ii) all Tenant Improvements have been accepted by Landlord, (iii) any and all liens related to the Tenant Improvements have either been discharged of record (by payment, bond, order of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise) or waived by the party filing such lien and (iv) no security interests relating to the Tenant Improvements are outstanding, (w) all certifications and approvals with respect to the Tenant Improvements that may be required from any Governmental Authority and any board of fire underwriters or similar body for the use and occupancy of the Premises, (x) certificates of insurance required by the Lease to be purchased and maintained by Tenant, (y) an affidavit from Tenant’s architect certifying that all work performed in, on or about the Premises is in accordance with the Approved Plans and (z) complete drawing print sets and electronic CADD files on disc of all contract documents for work performed by their architect and engineers in relation to the Tenant Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p497">4. Insurance.</p>
          <p id="s1p498">4.1. Property Insurance. At all times during the period beginning with commencement of construction of the Tenant Improvements and ending with final completion of the Tenant Improvements, Tenant shall maintain, or cause to be maintained (in addition to the insurance required of Tenant pursuant to the Lease), property insurance insuring Landlord and the</p>
          <p id="s1p499">Landlord Parties, as their interests may appear. Such policy shall, on a completed values basis for the full insurable value at all times, insure against loss or damage by fire, vandalism and malicious mischief and other such risks as are customarily covered by the so-called “broad form extended coverage endorsement” upon all Tenant Improvements and the general contractor’s and any subcontractors’ machinery, tools and equipment, all while each forms a part of, or is contained in, the Tenant Improvements or any temporary structures on the Premises, or is adjacent thereto; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, insurance coverage with respect to the general contractor’s and any subcontractors’ machinery, tools and equipment shall be carried on a primary basis by such general contractor or the applicable subcontractor(s). Tenant agrees to pay any deductible, and Landlord is not responsible for any deductible, for a claim under such insurance. Said property insurance shall contain an express waiver of any right of subrogation by the insurer against Landlord and the Landlord Parties, and shall name Landlord and its affiliates as loss payees as their interests may appear.</p>
          <p id="s1p500">4.2. Workers’ Compensation Insurance. At all times during the period of construction of the Tenant Improvements, Tenant shall, or shall cause its contractors or subcontractors to, maintain statutory workers’ compensation insurance as required by Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p501">5. Liability. Tenant assumes sole responsibility and liability for any and all injuries or the death of any persons, including Tenant’s contractors and subcontractors and their respective employees, agents and invitees, and for any and all damages to property caused by, resulting from or arising out of any act or omission on the part of Tenant, Tenant’s contractors or subcontractors, or their respective employees, agents and invitees in the prosecution of the Tenant Improvements. Tenant agrees to indemnify, save, defend (at Landlord’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold the Landlord Indemnitees harmless from and against all Claims, excluding consequential damages, due to, because of or arising out of any and all such injuries, death or damage, whether real or alleged, and Tenant and Tenant’s contractors and subcontractors shall assume and defend at their sole cost and expense all such Claims; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Work Letter shall be deemed to indemnify or otherwise hold Landlord harmless from or against liability caused by Landlord’s negligence or willful misconduct. Any deficiency in design or construction of the Tenant Improvements shall be solely the responsibility of Tenant, notwithstanding the fact that Landlord may have approved of the same in writing.</p>
          <p id="s1p502">6. TI Allowance.</p>
          <p id="s1p503">6.1. Application of TI Allowance. Landlord shall contribute the TI Allowance toward the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Tenant Improvements, in accordance with Article 4 of the Lease. If the entire TI Allowance is not applied toward or reserved for the costs of the Tenant Improvements, then Tenant shall not be entitled to a credit of such unused portion of the TI Allowance. Tenant may apply the TI Allowance for the payment of construction and other costs in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p504">6.2. Approval of Budget for the Tenant Improvements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth elsewhere in this Work Letter or the Lease, Landlord shall not have any obligation to expend any portion of the TI Allowance until Landlord and Tenant shall have approved in writing the budget for the Tenant Improvements (the “Approved Budget”). Prior to</p>
          <p id="s1p505">Landlord’s approval of the Approved Budget, Tenant shall pay all of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Tenant Improvements as they become due. Landlord shall not be obligated to reimburse Tenant for costs or expenses relating to the Tenant Improvements that exceed the amount of the TI Allowance. Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its approval of any budget for Tenant Improvements that is proposed by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p506">6.3. Advance Requests. Upon submission by Tenant to Landlord of (a) a statement (an “Advance Request”) setting forth the total amount of the TI Allowance requested, (b) a summary of the Tenant Improvements performed using AIA standard form Application for Payment (G 702) executed by the general contractor and by the architect, (c) invoices from the general contractor, the architect, and any subcontractors, material suppliers and other parties requesting payment with respect to the amount of the TI Allowance then being requested and (d) conditional lien releases from the general contractor and each subcontractor, professional service provider and material supplier with respect to the Tenant Improvements performed that correspond to the Advance Request, each in a form acceptable to Landlord and complying with Applicable Laws, then Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt by Landlord of an Advance Request and the accompanying materials required by this Section, pay to the applicable contractors, subcontractors and material suppliers or to Tenant (for reimbursement for payments made by Tenant prior to Landlord’s approval of the Approved Budget to such contractors, subcontractors or material suppliers), as elected by Landlord, the amount of Tenant Improvement costs set forth in such Advance Request; provided, however, that Landlord shall not be obligated to make any payments under this Section until the budget for the Tenant Improvements is approved in accordance with Section 6.2 above, and any Advance Request under this Section shall be subject to the payment limits set forth in Section 6.2 above and Article 4 of the Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall either pay or reimburse Tenant, as applicable, for the costs and expenses set forth in Subsection 4.2(s) of the Lease, in accordance with that Subsection, within fifteen (15) days after Tenant’s submission to Landlord of invoices or receipts, as applicable, reasonably acceptable to Landlord for such items. Additionally, within fifteen (15) days after any final payment to any applicable contractor, subcontractor, professional service provider or material supplier, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an unconditional waiver and release of lien upon payment from such contractor, subcontractor, professional service provider or material supplier in a form acceptable to Landlord and complying with Applicable Laws.</p>
