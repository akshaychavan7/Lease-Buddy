          <p id="s1p183">3. Term. The actual term of this Lease (as the same may be extended pursuant to Article 42 hereof, and as the same may be earlier terminated in accordance with this Lease, the “Term”) shall commence on the Term Commencement Date (as defined in Article 4) and end on October 31, 2023 (such date, the “Term Expiration Date”), subject to earlier termination of this Lease as provided herein and to extension pursuant to the Options.</p>
          <p id="s1p184">3.1 Tenant shall have the one-time option to terminate this Lease (the “ Termination Option”) effective as of October 31, 2020 (the “Termination Date”) by providing Landlord no less than nine (9) months’ prior written notice (the “Termination Notice”). On or before the Termination Date, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord the Termination Fee (as defined below) as consideration for and a condition precedent to such early termination. The “Termination Fee” means an amount equal to the unamortized amounts (as of the Termination Date) of (a) the Tenant Improvement Costs (as defined below) (which costs, shall be provided to Tenant upon Substantial Completion, together with reasonable back up documentation) and (b) the leasing commissions paid by Landlord in connection with this Lease, which amounts shall be calculated by amortizing the same on a straight-line basis at seven percent (7%) per annum commencing on the Term Commencement Date and ending on the Term Expiration Date. If Tenant fails to timely deliver to Landlord the Termination Notice or the</p>
          <p id="s1p185">4</p>
          <p id="s1p186">Termination Fee, then the Termination Option shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect. If Tenant timely delivers to Landlord the Termination Notice and the Termination Fee, then Tenant shall surrender the Premises to Landlord on or before the Termination Date in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this Lease. If Tenant does not so surrender the Premises in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this Lease on or before the Termination Date, then Tenant, pursuant to Article 27, shall become a tenant at sufferance until the actual date (the “Surrender Date”) that Tenant surrenders the Premises to Landlord in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Lease. If Tenant timely delivers to Landlord the Termination Notice and the Termination Fee, then this Lease shall terminate on the Termination Date and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect, except for those provisions that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, Tenant shall not be permitted to exercise the Termination Option during a Default (as defined below) that remains uncured. Any attempted exercise of the Termination Option during a Default that remains uncured shall be void and of no force or effect. The Termination Option is personal to GlycoMimetics, Inc. and may not be exercised by any assignee, sublessee or transferee of this Lease, except by a Tenant Affiliate (as defined below) subsequent to an assignment of this Lease to such Tenant Affiliate that qualifies as an Exempt Transfer (as defined below).</p>
          <p id="s1p187">4. Possession and Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p188">4.1 Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to tender possession of the Premises to Tenant on the Estimated Term Commencement Date, with the work (the “ Tenant Improvements”) required of Landlord on Exhibit B Substantially Complete (as defined below). Tenant agrees that in the event such work is not Substantially Complete on or before the Estimated Term Commencement Date for any reason, then (a) this Lease shall not be void or voidable, (b) Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, and (c) Tenant shall not be responsible for the payment of any Base Rent or Tenant’s Share (as defined below) of Operating Expenses (as defined below) until the actual Term Commencement Date as described in Section 4.2 occurs. The term “Substantially Complete” or “Substantial Completion” means that the Tenant Improvements are substantially complete in accordance with the plans attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “Tenant Improvement Plans”), except for Punch List Items (as defined below) and Tenant has received a use and occupancy permit (or the legal equivalent) from the appropriate Governmental Authorities allowing occupancy of the Premises. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord’s obligation to timely achieve Substantial Completion shall be subject to extension on a day-for-day basis as a result of Force Majeure (as defined below). When the Tenant Improvements are nearing Substantial Completion, Landlord shall notify Tenant and within five (5) business days thereafter Tenant and Landlord shall conduct a walk-through of the Premises and prepare a Punch List (as defined below) relating to the Tenant Improvements (the “T.I. Punch List”). Landlord shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its contractor for the Tenant Improvements to complete the Punch List Items on the T.I. Punch List within sixty (60) days thereafter. When Landlord considers the Tenant Improvements to be Substantially Complete, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant, for Tenant’s confirmation (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), notice thereof (the “Punch List Notice”), which will stipulate which of the Punch List Items on the T.I. Punch List, if any, remain incomplete. Failure of Tenant to respond to the Punch List Notice within five (5) business days after delivery to Tenant shall constitute Tenant’s confirmation of the contents thereof, including the outstanding Punch List Items from the T.I. Punch List. Tenant agrees that Landlord shall have no obligation to complete any</p>
          <p id="s1p189">5</p>

By way of illustration only, if the actual per square foot Controllable Operating Expenses during the calendar year 2016 are Two Dollars ($2.00), the Cap for the calendar year 2017 will be Two and 10/100 Dollars ($2.10) (i.e., $2.00 x 1.05) and the Cap for the calendar year 2018 will be Two and 21/100 Dollars ($2.21) (i.e., $2.10 x 1.05).</p>

          <p id="s1p242">9.2 Tenant shall pay to Landlord on the first day of each calendar month of the Term, as Additional Rent, (a) the Property Management Fee (as defined below) and (b) Landlord’s estimate of Tenant’s Share of Operating Expenses with respect to the Building, the South Campus and the Project, as applicable, for such month.</p>
          <p id="s1p243">(x) The “ Property Management Fee” shall equal three percent (3%) of Base Rent due from Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p244">(y) Within ninety (90) days after the conclusion of each calendar year (or such longer period as may be reasonably required by Landlord, but in no event longer than one hundred eighty (180) days after the conclusion of each calendar year), Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a statement showing in reasonable detail the actual Operating Expenses and Tenant’s Share of Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year. Any additional sum due from Tenant to Landlord shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after receipt of such statement. If the amounts paid by Tenant pursuant to this Section exceed Tenant’s Share of Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year, then Landlord shall credit the difference against the Rent next due and owing from Tenant; provided that, if the Term has expired, Landlord shall accompany such statement with payment for the amount of such difference.</p>
          <p id="s1p245">(z) Any amount due under this Section for any period that is less than a full month shall be prorated for such fractional month on the basis of the number of days in the month.</p>
          <p id="s1p246">9.3 Landlord may, from time to time, but not more often than once annually, modify Landlord’s calculation and allocation procedures for Operating Expenses, so long as such modifications produce Dollar results substantially consistent with Landlord’s then-current practice at the Project. Since the Project consists of multiple buildings and campuses, certain Operating Expenses may pertain to a particular building, certain Operating Expenses may pertain to the South Campus, and other Operating Expenses to the Project as a whole. Landlord reserves the right in its sole discretion to allocate any such costs applicable to any particular building within the Project to such building, any costs applicable to the South Campus to the buildings comprising the South Campus (including the Building), and other such costs applicable to the Project to each building in the Project (including the Building), with the tenants in each building being responsible for paying their respective proportionate shares of their buildings to the extent required under their leases. Landlord shall allocate such costs to the buildings (including the Building) in a reasonable, non-discriminatory manner, and such allocation shall be binding on Tenant. Upon written request from Tenant, Landlord shall provide Tenant with documentation reasonably supporting Landlord’s allocation of such costs.</p>

          <p id="s1p249">9.6 Operating Expenses for the calendar year in which Tenant’s obligation to share therein commences and for the calendar year in which such obligation ceases shall be prorated on a basis reasonably determined by Landlord. Expenses such as taxes, assessments and insurance premiums that are incurred for an extended time period shall be prorated based upon the time periods to which they apply so that the amounts attributed to the Premises relate in a reasonable manner to the time period wherein Tenant has an obligation to share in Operating Expenses.</p>

          <p id="s1p253">10. Taxes on Tenant’s Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p254">10.1 Tenant shall pay prior to delinquency any and all taxes levied against any personal property or trade fixtures placed by Tenant in or about the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p255">10.2 If any such taxes on Tenant’s personal property or trade fixtures are levied against Landlord or Landlord’s property or, if the assessed valuation of the Building, the Property or the Project is increased by inclusion therein of a value attributable to Tenant’s personal property or trade fixtures, and if Landlord, after written notice to Tenant, pays the taxes based upon any such increase in the assessed value of the Building, the Property or the Project, then Tenant shall, upon demand, repay to Landlord the taxes so paid by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p256">10.3 If any improvements in or alterations to the Premises, whether owned by Landlord or Tenant and whether or not affixed to the real property so as to become a part thereof, are assessed for real property tax purposes at a valuation higher than the valuation at which improvements conforming to Landlord’s building standards (the “Building Standard”) in other spaces in the Building are assessed, then the real property taxes and assessments levied against Landlord or the Building, the Property or the Project by reason of such excess assessed valuation shall be deemed to be taxes levied against personal property of Tenant and shall be governed by the provisions of Section 10.2. Any such excess assessed valuation due to improvements in or alterations to space in the Project leased by other tenants at the Project shall not be included in Operating Expenses. If the records of the applicable governmental assessor’s office are available and sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for determining whether such Tenant improvements or alterations are assessed at a higher valuation than the Building Standard, then such records shall be binding on both Landlord and Tenant.</p>

Tenant shall comply with any direction of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction that shall, by reason of the nature of Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, impose any duty upon Tenant or Landlord with respect to the Premises or with respect to the use or occupation thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p262">12.3 Tenant shall not do or permit to be done anything that will invalidate or increase the cost of any fire, environmental, extended coverage or any other insurance policy covering the Building or the Project, and shall comply with all rules, orders, regulations and requirements of the insurers of the Building and the Project, and Tenant shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for any additional premium charged for such policy by reason of Tenant’s failure to comply with the provisions of this Article.</p>
          <p id="s1p263">12.4 Tenant shall keep all doors opening onto public corridors closed, except when in use for ingress and egress.</p>

Signage shall conform to Landlord’s design criteria. For any Signage, Tenant shall, at Tenant’s own cost and expense, (a) acquire all permits for such Signage in compliance with Applicable Laws and (b) design, fabricate, install and maintain such Signage in a first-class condition; provided, however, that, subject to Applicable Laws, Landlord shall install not later than the Term Commencement Date, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, one sign on the top level of the facade on the exterior of the Building displaying Tenant’s corporate logo (with the design, size and location of such façade signage to be mutually agreed upon between Landlord and Tenant). Tenant shall be responsible for reimbursing Landlord for costs incurred by Landlord in removing any of Tenant’s Signage in the event of the termination of this Lease prior to the Term Expiration Date as a result of Tenant’s exercise of the Termination Option or a Default. Interior signs on entry doors to the Premises and the directory tablet shall be inscribed, painted or affixed for Tenant by Landlord at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, and shall be of a size, color and type and be located in a place acceptable to Landlord.

Except as otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 12.11, Tenant shall be responsible for all liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with the compliance of the Premises with the ADA, and Tenant shall indemnify, save, defend (at Landlord’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold Landlord and its affiliates, employees, agents and contractors; and any lender, mortgagee or beneficiary (each, a “Lender” and, collectively with Landlord and its affiliates, employees, agents and contractors, the “Landlord Indemnitees”) harmless from and against any demands, claims, liabilities, losses, costs, expenses, actions, causes of action, damages, suits or judgments, and all reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements, regardless of whether the applicable demand, claim, action, cause of action or suit is voluntarily withdrawn or dismissed) incurred in investigating or resisting the same (collectively, “Claims”) arising out of any such failure of the Premises to comply with the ADA. The provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p273">13.1 Tenant shall have the non-exclusive right, in common with others, to use the Common Areas in conjunction with Tenant’s use of the Premises for the Permitted Use, and such use of the Common Areas and Tenant’s use of the Premises shall be subject to the rules and regulations adopted by Landlord and attached hereto as Exhibit F, together with such other reasonable and nondiscriminatory rules and regulations as are hereafter promulgated by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion (the “Rules and Regulations”). Tenant shall faithfully observe and comply with the Rules and Regulations. Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant for the violation or non-performance</p>

          <p id="s1p276">13.2 This Lease is subject to any recorded covenants, conditions or restrictions on the Project or Property, as the same may be amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the “ CC&amp;Rs”). Tenant shall comply with the CC&amp;Rs.</p>
          <p id="s1p277">13.3 Tenant shall have a non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of parking facilities serving the Project in common on an unreserved basis with other tenants of the Project during the Term at no additional cost. As of the Execution Date, Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the parking facilities described above is equal to two point six (2.6) parking spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of Rentable Area (i.e., eighty-eight (88) spaces). Tenant shall have the option to convert four (4) of the unreserved parking spaces allocated to Tenant under this Section into reserved parking spaces (provided, however, that the location of such reserved spaces shall be subject to Landlord’s consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld). In the event Tenant makes such an election, Landlord shall appropriately mark and designate such reserved spaces and such reserved spaces shall be allocated to Tenant as part of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the parking facilities.</p>
          <p id="s1p278">13.4 Tenant agrees not to unreasonably overburden the parking facilities and agrees to cooperate with Landlord and other tenants in the use of the parking facilities. Landlord reserves the right to determine that parking facilities are becoming overcrowded and to limit Tenant’s use thereof, but not below the parking rights granted in Section 13.3 above. Upon such determination, Landlord may reasonably allocate parking spaces among Tenant and other tenants of the Building or the Project. Nothing in this Section, however, is intended to create an affirmative duty on Landlord’s part to monitor parking.</p>
          <p id="s1p279">14. Project Control by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p280">14.1 Landlord reserves full control over the Building and the Project to the extent not inconsistent with Tenant’s enjoyment of the Premises as provided by this Lease. This reservation includes Landlord’s right to subdivide the Project; convert the Building and other buildings within the Project to condominium units; change the size of the Project by selling all or a portion of the Project or adding real property and any improvements thereon to the Project; grant easements and licenses to third parties; maintain or establish ownership of the Building separate from fee title to the Property; make additions to or reconstruct portions of the Building and the Project; install, use, maintain, repair, replace and relocate for service to the Premises and other parts of the Building or the Project pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures, wherever located in the Premises, the Building or elsewhere at the Project; and alter or relocate any other Common Area or facility, including private drives, lobbies, entrances and landscaping; provided, however, that such rights shall be exercised in a way that does not materially adversely affect Tenant’s beneficial use and occupancy of the Premises, including the Permitted Use and Tenant’s access to the Premises.</p>

          <p id="s1p282">14.2 Possession of areas of the Premises necessary for utilities, services, safety and operation of the Project (as opposed to those areas exclusively serving the Premises) is reserved to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p283">14.3 Tenant shall, at Landlord’s request, promptly execute such further documents as may be reasonably appropriate to assist Landlord in the performance of its obligations hereunder; provided that Tenant need not execute any document that creates additional liability for, or imposes material additional obligations on, Tenant or that deprives Tenant of the quiet enjoyment and use of the Premises as provided for in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p284">14.4 Landlord may, at any and all reasonable times during non-business hours (or during business hours, if (a) with respect to SubSections 14.4(u) through 14.4(y), Tenant so requests, and (b) with respect to SubSection 14.4(z), if Landlord so requests), and upon one (1) business day’s prior notice (provided that no time restrictions shall apply or advance notice be required if an emergency necessitates immediate entry), enter the Premises to (u) inspect the same and to determine whether Tenant is in compliance with its obligations hereunder and to show the Premises to current and prospective purchasers and lenders, (v) supply any service Landlord is required to provide hereunder, (w) alter, improve or repair any portion of the Building other than the Premises for which access to the Premises is reasonably necessary, (x) post notices of nonresponsibility, (y) access the telephone equipment, electrical substation and fire risers and (z) show the Premises to prospective tenants during the final year of the Term. In connection with any such alteration, improvement or repair as described in SubSection 14.4(w), Landlord may erect in the Premises or elsewhere in the Project scaffolding and other structures reasonably required for the alteration, improvement or repair work to be performed, provided that such structures do not obstruct the view, if any, of Tenant’s Logo Sign from Shady Grove Road and Medical Center Drive, or from the parking facilities serving the Project for an unreasonable period of time given the scope of such work, unless Landlord provides temporary signage displaying Tenant’s logo and having visibility similar to that of Tenant’s existing exterior Building signage being obstructed by such work. In no event shall Tenant’s Rent abate as a result of Landlord’s activities pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that all such activities shall be conducted in such a manner so as to cause as little interference to Tenant as is reasonably possible. Landlord shall at all times retain a key with which to unlock all of the doors in the Premises. If an emergency necessitates immediate access to the Premises, Landlord may use whatever force is necessary to enter the Premises, and any such entry to the Premises shall not constitute a forcible or unlawful entry to the Premises, a detainer of the Premises, or an eviction of Tenant from the Premises or any portion thereof, but Landlord shall give Tenant telephonic and email notice promptly after any such entry, provided that Tenant has previously given Landlord a telephone number and email address for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant may elect, by providing not less than thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Landlord, to provide that certain areas within the Premises are restricted to Tenant, its employees and other authorized agents, following which such areas shall not be accessed by any other person (including Landlord and its agents), except when accompanied by an employee or agent of Tenant; provided, however, that Landlord may enter any such restricted areas of the Premises without prior notice and without being accompanied by an employee or agent of Tenant if an emergency necessitates immediate access thereto, and in such event, the provisions of the immediately prior sentence of this Subsection 14.4 shall apply to such entry.</p>

          <p id="s1p286">15. Quiet Enjoyment. Landlord covenants that Tenant, upon paying the Rent and performing its obligations contained in this Lease, may peacefully and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises, free from any claim by Landlord or persons claiming under Landlord, but subject to all of the terms and provisions hereof, provisions of Applicable Laws and rights of record to which this Lease is or may become subordinate. This covenant is in lieu of any other quiet enjoyment covenant, either express or implied.</p>

          <p id="s1p288">16.1 Landlord shall maintain the utility connections and facilities located in the Common Area as of the Execution Date up to the point of entry to the Premises. Tenant shall pay for all water (including the cost to service, repair and replace reverse osmosis, de-ionized and other treated water), gas, heat, light, power, telephone, internet service, cable television, other telecommunications and other utilities supplied to the Premises, together with any fees, surcharges and taxes thereon. If any such utility is not separately metered to Tenant, Tenant shall pay Tenant’s Share of all charges of such utility jointly metered with other premises as Additional Rent or, in the alternative, Landlord may, at its option, monitor the usage of such utilities by Tenant and charge Tenant with the cost of purchasing, installing and monitoring such metering equipment, which cost shall be paid by Tenant as Additional Rent. To the extent that Tenant uses more than Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of any utilities, then Tenant shall pay Landlord for Tenant’s Share of such utilities to reflect such excess. In the event that the South Campus or Project is less than fully occupied during a calendar year, Tenant acknowledges that Landlord may extrapolate utility usage that varies depending on the occupancy of the South Campus or Project (as applicable) to equal Landlord’s reasonable estimate of what such utility usage would have been had the South Campus or Project, as applicable, been fully occupied during such calendar year; provided, however, that Landlord shall not recover more than one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of such utilities.</p>
          <p id="s1p289">16.2 Landlord shall not be liable for, nor shall any eviction of Tenant result from, the failure to furnish any utility or service, whether or not such failure is caused by accidents; breakage; casualties (to the extent not caused by the party claiming Force Majeure); physical natural disasters; strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances or labor disputes (other than labor disturbances and labor disputes resulting solely from the acts or omissions of the party claiming Force Majeure); acts of terrorism; riots or civil disturbances; wars or insurrections; shortages of materials (which shortages are not unique to the party claiming Force Majeure); regulations, moratoria or other actions, inactions or delays; failures by third parties to deliver gas, oil or another suitable fuel supply, or inability of the party claiming Force Majeure, by exercise of reasonable diligence, to obtain gas, oil or another suitable fuel; or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the party claiming that Force Majeure has occurred (collectively, “ Force Majeure”). In the event of such failure, Tenant shall not be entitled to termination of this Lease or any abatement or reduction of Rent, nor shall Tenant be relieved from the operation of any covenant or agreement of this Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, if, for more than five (5) consecutive business days following written notice to Landlord and as a result of Landlord’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its maintenance and repair obligations under this Lease (and except to the extent that such failure is caused in whole or in part by the action or inaction of a Tenant Party), the provision of HVAC (as defined below) or other utilities to all or a material portion of the Premises that Landlord must provide pursuant to this Lease is interrupted (a “Material Services Failure”), then Tenant’s Base Rent and Operating Expenses (or, to the extent that less than all of the Premises are affected, a</p>

          <p id="s1p291">proportionate amount (based on the Rentable Area of the Premises that is rendered unusable) of Base Rent and Operating Expenses) shall thereafter be abated until the Premises are again usable by Tenant for the Permitted Use; provided, however, that, if Landlord provides substitute HVAC and other utilities reasonably suitable for Tenant’s continued use and occupancy of the Premises for the Permitted Use (e.g., supplying potable water or portable air conditioning equipment), then neither Base Rent nor Operating Expenses shall be abated. During any Material Services Failure, Tenant will cooperate with Landlord to arrange for the provision of any interrupted utility services on an interim basis via temporary measures until final corrective measures can be accomplished, and Tenant will permit Landlord the necessary access to the Premises to remedy such Material Service Failure. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, but subject to Article 24 (which shall govern in the event of a casualty), the provisions of this Section shall be Tenant’s sole recourse and remedy in the event of an interruption of HVAC or other utilities to the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p292">16.3 Tenant shall pay for, prior to delinquency of payment therefor, any utilities and services that may be furnished to the Premises during or, if Tenant occupies the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, after the Term, including telephone, internet service, cable television and other telecommunications, together with any fees, surcharges and taxes thereon. Upon Landlord’s demand, utilities and services provided to the Premises that are separately metered shall be paid by Tenant directly to the supplier of such utilities or services.</p>
          <p id="s1p293">16.4 Tenant shall not, without Landlord’s prior written consent, use any device in the Premises (including data processing machines) that will in any way (a) increase the amount of ventilation, air exchange, gas, steam, electricity or water required or consumed in the Premises based upon Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building, South Campus or Project (as applicable) beyond the existing capacity of the Building, South Campus or the Project usually furnished or supplied for the Permitted Use or (b) exceed Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building’s, South Campus’s or Project’s (as applicable) capacity to provide such utilities or services; provided, however, that Tenant shall not be in breach of this Section 16.4 if within ten (10) days after notice from Landlord that Tenant failed to obtain Landlord’s prior written consent as required under this Section 16.4 Tenant either (a) obtains Landlord’s written consent to the use of such device or devices, or (b) ceases the use thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p294">16.5 If Tenant shall require utilities or services in excess of those usually furnished or supplied for tenants in similar spaces in the Building, South Campus or the Project by reason of Tenant’s equipment or extended hours of business operations, then Tenant shall first procure Landlord’s consent for the use thereof, which consent Landlord may condition upon the availability of such excess utilities or services, and Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent an amount equal to the cost of providing such excess utilities and services.</p>
          <p id="s1p295">16.6 Landlord shall provide water in Common Areas for lavatory and landscaping purposes only, which water shall be from the local municipal or similar source; provided, however, that if Landlord determines that Tenant requires, uses or consumes water provided to the Common Areas for any purpose other than ordinary lavatory purposes, Landlord may install a water meter (“Tenant Water Meter”) and thereby measure Tenant’s water consumption for all purposes. Landlord shall pay for the costs of any Tenant Water Meter and the installation and maintenance thereof during the Term. If Landlord installs a Tenant Water Meter, Tenant shall pay for water consumed, as shown on such meter, as and when bills are rendered. If Tenant fails to timely make</p>
          <p id="s1p296">22</p>
          <p id="s1p297">such payments, Landlord may pay such charges and collect the same from Tenant. Any such costs or expenses incurred or payments made by Landlord for any of the reasons or purposes stated in this Section shall be deemed to be Additional Rent payable by Tenant and collectible by Landlord as such.</p>
          <p id="s1p298">16.7 Landlord reserves the right to stop service of the elevator, plumbing, ventilation, air conditioning and utility systems, when Landlord deems necessary or desirable, due to accident, emergency or the need to make repairs, alterations or improvements, until such repairs, alterations or improvements shall have been completed, and, subject to the abatement right set forth in Section 16.2 above, Landlord shall further have no responsibility or liability for failure to supply elevator facilities, plumbing, ventilation, air conditioning or utility service when prevented from doing so by Force Majeure. Without limiting the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that any covenants on Landlord’s part to furnish any service pursuant to any of the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions or agreements of this Lease, or to perform any act or thing for the benefit of Tenant, shall not be deemed breached if Landlord is unable to furnish or perform the same by virtue of Force Majeure.</p>
          <p id="s1p299">16.8 There currently exists a back-up generator in the South Campus that is connected to the Premises’ emergency electrical panel (the “Generator”). Tenant shall be entitled to use up to its proportionate share (after deducting any power from the Generator required for the Common Area and any systems and equipment located with the Building and serving other areas of the South Campus) of power from the Generator on a non-exclusive basis with other tenants in the South Campus. The cost of maintaining, repairing and replacing the Generator shall constitute Operating Expenses. Landlord expressly disclaims any warranties with regard to the Generator or the installation thereof, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Landlord shall maintain the Generator in good working condition, but shall not be liable for any failure to make any repairs or to perform any maintenance that is an obligation of Landlord unless such failure shall persist for an unreasonable time after Tenant provides Landlord with written notice of the need for such repairs or maintenance.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, the quantity of Hazardous Materials allowed by this Section 21.9 is specific to Tenant and shall not run with the Lease in the event of a Transfer (as defined in Article 29). In the event of a Transfer, if the use of Hazardous Materials by such new tenant (“New Tenant”) is such that New Tenant utilizes fire control areas in the Project in excess of New Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building, the South Campus or the Project, as applicable, then New Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense and upon Landlord’s written request, establish and maintain a separate area of the Premises classified by the UBC as an “H” occupancy area for the use and storage of Hazardous Materials, or take such other action as is necessary to ensure that its share of the fire control areas of the Building, the South Campus and the Project is not greater than New Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building,</p>

Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord shall not have and expressly disclaims any liability related to Tenant’s or other tenants’ use or disposal of fire control areas, it being acknowledged by Tenant that Tenant and other tenants are best suited to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its Hazardous Materials usage and procedures.</p>
          <p id="s1p354">21.10 If at any time during the Term any Hazardous Material is released, discharged or disposed of on the Property in violation of Applicable Laws, which release, discharge or disposal is not Tenant’s responsibility under this Lease, then (a) Landlord shall take such action with respect thereto as is required by Applicable Laws to be taken by Landlord, and (b) if such release, discharge or disposal was caused by Landlord, then such action will be taken by Landlord at no cost to Tenant (either directly or as an Operating Expense).</p>

Landlord and Tenant therefore agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p356">22.1 Tenant shall not cause or permit (or conduct any activities that would cause) any release of any odors or fumes of any kind from the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p357">22.2 If the Building has a ventilation system that, in Landlord’s judgment, is adequate, suitable, and appropriate to vent the Premises in a manner that does not release odors affecting any indoor or outdoor part of the Project, Tenant shall vent the Premises through such system. If Landlord at any time determines that any existing ventilation system is inadequate, or if no ventilation system exists, Tenant shall in compliance with Applicable Laws vent all fumes and odors from the Premises (and remove odors from Tenant’s exhaust stream) as Landlord requires. The placement and configuration of all ventilation exhaust pipes, louvers and other equipment shall be subject to Landlord’s approval. Tenant acknowledges Landlord’s legitimate desire to maintain the Project (indoor and outdoor areas) in an odor-free manner, and to the extent (a) any such odors are traced back to Tenant’s use of the Premises and (b) Landlord receives (i) one (1) or more complaints from more than one (1) third party with respect to such odors or (ii) more than one (1) complaint from any single third party with respect to such odors, Landlord may require Tenant to abate and remove all such odors in a manner that goes beyond the requirements of Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p358">22.3 Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, provide odor eliminators and other devices (such as filters, air cleaners, scrubbers and whatever other equipment may in Landlord’s judgment be necessary or appropriate from time to time) to completely remove, eliminate and abate any odors, fumes or other substances in Tenant’s exhaust stream that, in Landlord’s judgment, emanate from Tenant’s Premises. Any work Tenant performs under this Section shall constitute Alterations.</p>
          <p id="s1p359">22.4 Tenant’s responsibility to remove, eliminate and abate odors, fumes and exhaust shall continue throughout the Term. Landlord’s construction of the Tenant Improvements shall not preclude Landlord from requiring additional measures to eliminate odors, fumes and other adverse</p>
          <p id="s1p360">32</p>
          <p id="s1p361">impacts of Tenant’s exhaust stream (as Landlord may designate in Landlord’s discretion), unless Landlord failed to construct the Tenant Improvements in accordance with the Tenant Improvement Plans, as the Tenant Improvement Plans may have been updated pursuant to Section 4.5.4 above, and but for such failure such additional measures would not be necessary. Tenant shall install additional equipment as Landlord requires from time to time under the preceding sentence. Such installations shall constitute Alterations.</p>
          <p id="s1p362">22.5 If Tenant fails to install satisfactory odor control equipment within ten (10) business days after Landlord’s demand made at any time, then Landlord may, without limiting Landlord’s other rights and remedies, require Tenant to cease and suspend any operations in the Premises that, in Landlord’s determination, cause odors, fumes or exhaust. For example, if Landlord determines that Tenant’s production of a certain type of product causes odors, fumes or exhaust, and Tenant does not install satisfactory odor control equipment within ten (10) business days after Landlord’s request, then Landlord may require Tenant to stop producing such type of product in the Premises unless and until Tenant has installed odor control equipment satisfactory to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p363">23. Insurance; Waiver of Subrogation.</p>
          <p id="s1p364">23.1 Landlord shall maintain insurance for the Building and the Project in amounts equal to full replacement cost (exclusive of the costs of excavation, foundations and footings, engineering costs or such other costs that would not be incurred in the event of a rebuild and without reference to depreciation taken by Landlord upon its books or tax returns) or such lesser coverage as Landlord may elect so long as Landlord maintains Ordinance or Law Coverage for the Building, provided that such coverage shall not be less than the amount of such insurance Landlord’s Lender, if any, requires Landlord to maintain, providing protection against any peril generally included within the classification “Fire and Extended Coverage,” together with insurance against sprinkler damage (if applicable), vandalism and malicious mischief. Landlord, subject to availability thereof, shall further insure, if Landlord deems it appropriate, coverage against flood, environmental hazard, earthquake, loss or failure of building equipment, rental loss during the period of repairs or rebuilding, Workers’ Compensation insurance and fidelity bonds for employees employed to perform services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may, but shall not be deemed required to, provide insurance for any improvements installed by Tenant or that are in addition to the standard improvements customarily furnished by Landlord, without regard to whether or not such are made a part of or are affixed to the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p365">23.2 In addition, Landlord shall carry Commercial General Liability insurance with limits of not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence/general aggregate for bodily injury (including death), or property damage with respect to the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p366">23.3 Tenant shall, at its own cost and expense, procure and maintain during the Term the following insurance for the benefit of Tenant and Landlord (as their interests may appear) with insurers financially acceptable and lawfully authorized to do business in the state where the Premises are located:</p>
          <p id="s1p367">(a) Commercial General Liability insurance on a broad-based occurrence coverage form, with coverages including but not limited to bodily injury (including death), property damage (including loss of use resulting therefrom), premises/operations, personal &amp; advertising</p>

          <p id="s1p370">(b) Commercial Automobile Liability insurance covering liability arising from the use or operation of any auto, including those owned, hired or otherwise operated or used by or on behalf of the Tenant. The coverage shall be on a broad-based occurrence form with combined single limits of not less than $1,000,000 per accident for bodily injury and property damage.</p>
          <p id="s1p371">(c) Commercial Property insurance covering property damage to the full replacement cost value and business interruption. Covered property shall include all tenant improvements in the Premises and Tenant’s Property including personal property, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, stock, inventory and improvements and betterments, which may be owned by Tenant or Landlord and required to be insured hereunder, or which may be leased, rented, borrowed or in the care custody or control of Tenant, or Tenant’s agents, employees or subcontractors. Such insurance, with respect only to all Tenant Improvements, Alterations or other work performed on the Premises by Tenant (collectively, “Tenant Work”), shall name Landlord and Landlord’s current and future mortgagees as loss payees as their interests may appear. Such insurance shall be written on an “all risk” of physical loss or damage basis including the perils of fire, extended coverage, electrical injury, mechanical breakdown, windstorm, vandalism, malicious mischief, sprinkler leakage, back-up of sewers or drains, flood and such other risks Landlord may from time to time reasonably designate, for the full replacement cost value of the covered items with an agreed amount endorsement with no co-insurance. Business interruption coverage shall have limits sufficient to cover Tenant’s lost profits and necessary continuing expenses, including rents due Landlord under the Lease. The minimum period of indemnity for business interruption coverage shall be twelve (12) months plus twelve (12) months’ extended period of indemnity if available at commercially reasonable rates.</p>
          <p id="s1p372">(d) Workers’ Compensation insurance as is required by statute or law, or as may be available on a voluntary basis and Employers’ Liability insurance with limits of not less than the following: each accident, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000); disease ($500,000); disease (each employee), Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).</p>
          <p id="s1p373">(e) Intentionally Omitted.</p>
          <p id="s1p374">(f) Pollution Legal Liability insurance is required if Tenant stores, handles, generates or treats Hazardous Materials, as determined solely by Landlord, on or about the Premises. Such coverage shall include bodily injury, sickness, disease, death or mental anguish or shock sustained by any person; property damage including physical injury to or destruction of tangible property including the resulting loss of use thereof, clean up costs, and the loss of use of tangible property that has not been physically injured or destroyed; and defense costs, charges and expenses incurred in the investigation, adjustment or defense of claims for such compensatory damages. Coverage shall apply to both sudden and non-sudden pollution conditions including the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water. Claims-made coverage is permitted, provided the policy</p>
          <p id="s1p375">34</p>
          <p id="s1p376">retroactive date is continuously maintained prior to the commencement date of this agreement, and coverage is continuously maintained during all periods in which Tenant occupies the Premises. Coverage shall be maintained with limits of not less than $1,000,000 per incident with a $2,000,000 policy aggregate.</p>
          <p id="s1p377">(g) During all construction by Tenant at the Premises, with respect to tenant improvements being constructed (including any Alterations), insurance required in Exhibit B-1 must be in place.</p>
          <p id="s1p378">23.4 The insurance required of Tenant by this Article shall be with companies at all times having a current rating of not less than A- and financial category rating of at least Class VII in “A.M. Best’s Insurance Guide” current edition. Tenant shall obtain for Landlord from the insurance companies/broker or cause the insurance companies/broker to furnish certificates of insurance evidencing all coverages required herein to Landlord. Landlord reserves the right to require complete, certified copies of all required insurance policies including any endorsements. No such policy shall be cancelable or subject to reduction of coverage or other modification or cancellation except after thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Landlord from Tenant or its insurers (except in the event of non-payment of premium, in which case ten (10) days’ written notice shall be given). All such policies shall be written as primary policies, not contributing with and not in excess of the coverage that Landlord may carry. Tenant’s required policies shall contain severability of interests clauses stating that, except with respect to limits of insurance, coverage shall apply separately to each insured or additional insured. Tenant shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Landlord with renewal certificates of insurance or binders. Tenant agrees that if Tenant does not take out and maintain such insurance, Landlord may (but shall not be required to) procure such insurance on Tenant’s behalf and at its cost to be paid by Tenant as Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p379">Commercial General Liability, Commercial Automobile Liability, Umbrella Liability and Pollution Legal Liability insurance as required above shall name Landlord, BioMed Realty, L.P., BioMed Realty Trust, Inc., and their respective officers, employees, agents, general partners, members, subsidiaries, affiliates and Lenders (“ Landlord Parties”) as additional insureds as respects liability arising from work or operations performed by or on behalf of Tenant, Tenant’s use or occupancy of Premises, and ownership, maintenance or use of vehicles by or on behalf of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p380">23.5 In each instance where insurance is to name Landlord Parties as additional insureds, Tenant shall, upon Landlord’s written request, also designate and furnish certificates evidencing such Landlord Parties as additional insureds to (a) any Lender of Landlord holding a security interest in the Building or the Project, (b) the landlord under any lease whereunder Landlord is a tenant of the real property upon which the Building is located if the interest of Landlord is or shall become that of a tenant under a ground lease rather than that of a fee owner and (c) any management company retained by Landlord to manage the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p381">23.6 Tenant assumes the risk of damage to any fixtures, goods, inventory, merchandise, equipment and leasehold improvements, and Landlord shall not be liable for injury to Tenant’s business or any loss of income therefrom, relative to such damage, all as more particularly set forth within this Lease. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, carry such insurance as Tenant desires for Tenant’s protection with respect to personal property of Tenant or business interruption.</p>
          <p id="s1p382">35</p>
          <p id="s1p383">23.7 Landlord, Tenant and each of their respective insurers hereby waive any and all rights of recovery or subrogation against one another or against the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of the other as respects any loss, damage, claims, suits or demands, howsoever caused, that are covered, or should have been covered, by valid and collectible insurance, including any deductibles or self-insurance maintained thereunder even if such deductible is required to be paid by the party suffering the loss. If necessary, each party agrees to endorse the required insurance policies to permit waivers of subrogation as required hereunder and hold harmless and indemnify the other party for any loss or expense incurred as a result of a failure to obtain such waivers of subrogation from insurers. Such waivers shall continue so long as their respective insurers so permit. Any termination of such a waiver shall be by written notice to the other party, containing a description of the circumstances hereinafter set forth in this Section 23.7. Landlord and Tenant, upon obtaining the policies of insurance required or permitted under this Lease, shall give notice to the insurance carrier or carriers that the foregoing mutual waiver of subrogation is contained in this Lease. If such policies shall not be obtainable with such waiver or shall be so obtainable only at a premium over that chargeable without such waiver, then the party seeking such policy shall notify the other of such conditions, and the party so notified shall have ten (10) days thereafter to either (a) procure such insurance with companies reasonably satisfactory to the other party or (b) agree to pay such additional premium (in Tenant’s case, in the proportion that the area of the Premises bears to the insured area). If the parties do not accomplish either (a) or (b), then this Section 23.7 shall have no effect during such time as such policies shall not be obtainable or the party in whose favor a waiver of subrogation is desired refuses to pay the additional premium. If such policies shall at any time be unobtainable, but shall be subsequently obtainable, then neither party shall be subsequently liable for a failure to obtain such insurance until a reasonable time after notification thereof by the other party. If the release of either Landlord or Tenant, as set forth in the first sentence of this Section 23.7, shall contravene Applicable Laws, then the liability of the party in question shall be deemed not released but shall be secondary to the other party’s insurer.</p>
          <p id="s1p384">23.8 Landlord may require insurance policy limits required under this Lease to be raised to conform with requirements of Landlord’s Lender or to bring coverage limits to levels then being required of new tenants within the Project.</p>

If Affected Areas are to be repaired, reconstructed or restored in accordance with the foregoing, Landlord shall make available to Tenant any portion of insurance proceeds it receives that are allocable to the Alterations constructed by Tenant pursuant to this Lease; provided Tenant is not then in Default under this Lease, and subject to the requirements of any Lender of Landlord.</p>

          <p id="s1p427">29. Assignment or Subletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p428">29.1 Except as hereinafter expressly permitted, Tenant shall not, either voluntarily or by operation of Applicable Laws, directly or indirectly sell, hypothecate, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise transfer this Lease or sublet the Premises (each, a “Transfer”), without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to Transfer without Landlord’s prior written consent the Premises or any part thereof to any person that as of the date of determination and at all times thereafter directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Tenant (“Tenant’s Affiliate”); provided that Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the effectiveness of such Transfer to Tenant’s Affiliate (an “Exempt Transfer”) and otherwise comply with the requirements of this Lease regarding such Transfer; and provided, further, that the person that will be the tenant under this Lease after the Exempt Transfer has a net worth (as of both the day immediately prior to and the day immediately after the Exempt Transfer) that is equal to or greater than the net worth (as of both the Execution Date and the date of the Exempt Transfer) of the transferring Tenant. For purposes of Exempt Transfers, “control” requires both (a) owning (directly or indirectly) more than fifty percent (50%) of the stock or other equity interests of another person and (b) possessing, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person. In no event shall Tenant perform a Transfer to or with an entity that is a tenant at the Project or that is in discussions or negotiations with Landlord or an affiliate of Landlord to lease premises at the Project or a property owned by Landlord or an affiliate of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p429">29.2 In the event Tenant desires to effect a Transfer, then, at least ten (10) but not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date when Tenant desires the Transfer to be effective (the “ Transfer Date”), Tenant shall provide written notice to Landlord (the “Transfer Notice”) containing information (including references) concerning the character of the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee; the Transfer Date; the most recent unconsolidated financial statements of Tenant and of the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee satisfying the requirements of Section 40.2 (“Required</p>
          <p id="s1p430">41</p>
          <p id="s1p431">Financials”); any ownership or commercial relationship between Tenant and the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee; and the consideration and all other material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer, all in such detail as Landlord shall reasonably require.</p>
          <p id="s1p432">29.3 Landlord, in determining whether consent should be given to a proposed Transfer, may give consideration to (a) the financial strength of Tenant and of such transferee, assignee or sublessee (notwithstanding Tenant remaining liable for Tenant’s performance), (b) any change in use that such transferee, assignee or sublessee proposes to make in the use of the Premises and (c) Landlord’s desire to exercise its rights under Section 29.7 to cancel this Lease. In no event shall Landlord be deemed to be unreasonable for declining to consent to a Transfer to a transferee, assignee or sublessee of poor reputation, lacking financial qualifications or seeking a change in the Permitted Use, or jeopardizing directly or indirectly the status of Landlord or any of Landlord’s affiliates as a Real Estate Investment Trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Revenue Code”). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, (w) no Transfer shall be consummated on any basis such that the rental or other amounts to be paid by the occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee thereunder would be based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits derived by the business activities of such occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee; (x) Tenant shall not furnish or render any services to an occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee with respect to whom transfer consideration is required to be paid, or manage or operate the Premises or any capital additions so transferred, with respect to which transfer consideration is being paid; (y) Tenant shall not consummate a Transfer with any person in which Landlord owns an interest, directly or indirectly (by applying constructive ownership rules set forth in Section 856(d)(5) of the Revenue Code); and (z) Tenant shall not consummate a Transfer with any person or in any manner that could cause any portion of the amounts received by Landlord pursuant to this Lease or any sublease, license or other arrangement for the right to use, occupy or possess any portion of the Premises to fail to qualify as “rents from real property” within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Revenue Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto or which could cause any other income of Landlord to fail to qualify as income described in Section 856(c)(2) of the Revenue Code.</p>
          <p id="s1p433">29.4 The following are conditions precedent to a Transfer or to Landlord considering a request by Tenant to a Transfer:</p>
          <p id="s1p434">(a) Tenant shall remain fully liable under this Lease during the unexpired Term. Tenant agrees that it shall not be (and shall not be deemed to be) a guarantor or surety of this Lease, however, and waives its right to claim that is it is a guarantor or surety or to raise in any legal proceeding any guarantor or surety defenses permitted by this Lease or by Applicable Laws;</p>
          <p id="s1p435">(b) If Tenant or the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee does not or cannot deliver the Required Financials, then Landlord may elect to have either Tenant’s ultimate parent company or the proposed transferee’s, assignee’s or sublessee’s ultimate parent company provide a guaranty of the applicable entity’s obligations under this Lease, in a form acceptable to Landlord, which guaranty shall be executed and delivered to Landlord by the applicable guarantor prior to the Transfer Date;</p>
          <p id="s1p436">(c) In the case of an Exempt Transfer, Tenant shall provide Landlord with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord that the Transfer qualifies as an Exempt Transfer;</p>
          <p id="s1p437">42</p>
          <p id="s1p438">(d) Tenant shall provide Landlord with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord that the value of Landlord’s interest under this Lease shall not be diminished or reduced by the proposed Transfer. Such evidence shall include evidence respecting the relevant business experience and financial responsibility and status of the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee;</p>
          <p id="s1p439">(e) Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord’s actual costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements incurred in connection with the review, processing and documentation of such request;</p>
          <p id="s1p440">(f) Except with respect to an Exempt Transfer, if Tenant’s transfer of rights or sharing of the Premises provides for the receipt by, on behalf of or on account of Tenant of any consideration of any kind whatsoever (including a premium rental for a sublease or lump sum payment for an assignment, but excluding Tenant’s reasonable costs in marketing and subleasing the Premises) in excess of the rental and other charges due to Landlord under this Lease, Tenant shall pay fifty percent (50%) of all of such excess to Landlord, after making deductions for any reasonable marketing expenses, tenant improvement funds expended by Tenant, alterations, cash concessions, brokerage commissions, attorneys’ fees and free rent actually paid by Tenant. If such consideration consists of cash paid to Tenant, payment to Landlord shall be made upon receipt by Tenant of such cash payment;</p>
          <p id="s1p441">(g) The proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall agree that, in the event Landlord gives such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee notice that Tenant is in default under this Lease, such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall thereafter make all payments otherwise due Tenant directly to Landlord, which payments shall be received by Landlord without any liability being incurred by Landlord, except to credit such payment against those due by Tenant under this Lease, and any such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall agree to attorn to Landlord or its successors and assigns should this Lease be terminated for any reason; provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord or its Lenders, successors or assigns be obligated to accept such attornment;</p>
          <p id="s1p442">(h) Landlord’s consent to any such Transfer shall be effected on Landlord’s forms;</p>
          <p id="s1p443">(i) Tenant shall not then be in Default, which remains uncured;</p>
          <p id="s1p444">(j) Such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee’s use of the Premises shall be the same as the Permitted Use;</p>
          <p id="s1p445">(k) Landlord shall not be bound by any provision of any agreement pertaining to the Transfer, except for Landlord’s written consent to the same;</p>
          <p id="s1p446">(l) Tenant shall pay all transfer and other taxes (including interest and penalties) assessed or payable for any Transfer;</p>
          <p id="s1p447">(m) Landlord’s consent (or waiver of its rights) for any Transfer shall not waive Landlord’s right to consent or refuse consent to any later Transfer;</p>
          <p id="s1p448">43</p>
          <p id="s1p449">(n) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord one executed copy of any and all written instruments evidencing or relating to the Transfer; and</p>
          <p id="s1p450">(o) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a list of Hazardous Materials (as defined below), certified by the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee to be true and correct, that the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee intends to use or store in the Premises. Additionally, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord, on or before the date any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee takes occupancy of the Premises, all of the items relating to Hazardous Materials of such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee as described in Section 21.2.</p>
          <p id="s1p451">29.5 Any Transfer that is not in compliance with the provisions of this Article or with respect to which Tenant does not fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Article shall be void and shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p452">29.6 Notwithstanding any Transfer, Tenant shall remain fully and primarily liable for the payment of all Rent and other sums due or to become due hereunder, and for the full performance of all other terms, conditions and covenants to be kept and performed by Tenant. The acceptance of Rent or any other sum due hereunder, or the acceptance of performance of any other term, covenant or condition thereof, from any person or entity other than Tenant shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the provisions of this Lease or a consent to any Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p453">29.7 If Tenant delivers to Landlord a Transfer Notice indicating a desire to transfer this Lease to a proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee other than pursuant to an Exempt Transfer, then Landlord shall have the option, exercisable by giving notice to Tenant at any time within ten (10) days after Landlord’s receipt of such Transfer Notice, to terminate this Lease as of the date specified in the Transfer Notice as the Transfer Date, except for those provisions that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination hereof. If Landlord exercises such option, then Tenant shall have the right to withdraw such Transfer Notice by delivering to Landlord written notice of such election within five (5) days after Landlord’s delivery of notice electing to exercise Landlord’s option to terminate this Lease. In the event Tenant withdraws the Transfer Notice as provided in this Section, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. No failure of Landlord to exercise its option to terminate this Lease shall be deemed to be Landlord’s consent to a proposed Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p454">29.8 If Tenant sublets the Premises or any portion thereof, Tenant hereby immediately and irrevocably assigns to Landlord, as security for Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, all rent from any such subletting, and during any period that Tenant is in Default, appoints Landlord as assignee and attorney-in-fact for Tenant, and Landlord (or a receiver for Tenant appointed on Landlord’s application) may collect such rent and apply it toward Tenant’s obligations under this Lease; provided that, until the occurrence of a Default (as defined below) by Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to collect such rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p455">30. Subordination and Attornment.</p>
          <p id="s1p456">30.1 This Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any mortgage, deed of trust, or lease in which Landlord is tenant now or hereafter in force against the Building or the Project and to all advances made or hereafter to be made upon the security thereof without the necessity of the</p>
          <p id="s1p457">44</p>
          <p id="s1p458">execution and delivery of any further instruments on the part of Tenant to effectuate such subordination; provided, however, that as a condition precedent to such subordination Tenant shall receive a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement from (a) any mortgagee under a mortgage or beneficiary of a deed of trust covering the Premises, the Building or the Project or (b) landlord under a new lease of the land upon which or within which the Premises, the Building or the Project is located wherein Landlord is tenant (each, a “Mortgagee”). As of the Execution Date, there are no mortgages, deeds of trust or ground leases encumbering the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p459">30.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall execute and deliver upon demand and receipt of a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement such further instrument or instruments evidencing subordination of this Lease to the lien of any future mortgage or mortgages or deeds of trust or lease in which Landlord is tenant as may be required by Landlord. If any such Mortgagee so elects, however, this Lease shall be deemed prior in lien to any such lease, mortgage, or deed of trust upon or including the Premises regardless of date and Tenant shall execute a statement in writing to such effect at Landlord’s request.</p>
          <p id="s1p460">30.3 Upon written request of Landlord and opportunity for Tenant to review, Tenant agrees to execute any Lease amendments not materially altering the terms of this Lease, if required by a Mortgagee.</p>
          <p id="s1p461">30.4 In the event any proceedings are brought for foreclosure, or in the event of the exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage or deed of trust made by Landlord covering the Premises, Tenant shall, subject to the provisions of Section 30.1 above, at the election of the purchaser at such foreclosure or sale attorn to the purchaser upon any such foreclosure or sale and recognize such purchaser as Landlord under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p462">31. Defaults and Remedies.</p>
          <p id="s1p463">31.1 Late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent and other sums due shall cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which shall be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. Such costs include processing and accounting charges and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any mortgage or trust deed covering the Premises. Therefore, if any installment of Rent due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within seven (7) days after the date such payment is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord (a) an additional sum of five percent (5%) of the overdue Rent as a late charge plus (b) interest at an annual rate (the “Default Rate”) equal to the lesser of (y) eight percent (8%) and (z) the highest rate permitted by Applicable Laws. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord shall incur by reason of late payment by Tenant and shall be payable as Additional Rent to Landlord due with the next installment of Rent or within five (5) business days after Landlord’s demand, whichever is earlier. Landlord’s acceptance of any Additional Rent (including a late charge or any other amount hereunder) shall not be deemed an extension of the date that Rent is due or prevent Landlord from pursuing any other rights or remedies under this Lease, at law or in equity.</p>
          <p id="s1p464">31.2 No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the Rent payment herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than on account of the Rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as Rent be</p>
          <p id="s1p465">45</p>
          <p id="s1p466">deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover the balance of such Rent or pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease or in equity or at law. If a dispute shall arise as to any amount or sum of money to be paid by Tenant to Landlord hereunder, Tenant shall have the right to make payment “under protest,” such payment shall not be regarded as a voluntary payment, and there shall survive the right on the part of Tenant to institute suit for recovery of the payment paid under protest.</p>
          <p id="s1p467">31.3 If Tenant fails to pay any sum of money required to be paid by it hereunder or perform any other act on its part to be performed hereunder, in each case within the applicable cure period (if any) described in Section 31.4, then Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to), without waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligations of Tenant, make such payment or perform such act; provided that such failure by Tenant unreasonably interfered with the use of the Project by any other tenant or with the efficient operation of the Building or the Project, or resulted or could have resulted in a violation of Applicable Laws or the cancellation of an insurance policy maintained by Landlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an emergency, Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises and act in accordance with its rights as provided elsewhere in this Lease. In addition to the late charge described in Section 31.1, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent all sums so paid or incurred by Landlord, together with interest at the Default Rate, computed from the date such sums were paid or incurred.</p>
          <p id="s1p468">31.4 The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute a “Default” hereunder by Tenant:</p>
          <p id="s1p469">(a) Tenant abandons or vacates the Premises;</p>
          <p id="s1p470">(b) Tenant fails to make any payment of Rent, as and when due, or to satisfy its obligations under Article 19, where such failure shall continue for a period of seven (7) days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant;</p>
          <p id="s1p471">(c) Tenant fails to observe or perform any obligation or covenant contained herein (other than as described in Sections 31.4(a), 31.4(b), 31.4(h) and 31.4(j)) to be performed by Tenant, where such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant; provided that, if the nature of Tenant’s default is such that it reasonably requires more than thirty (30) days to cure, Tenant shall not be deemed to be in Default if Tenant commences such cure within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion; and provided, further, that such cure is completed no later than ninety (90) days after Tenant’s receipt of written notice from Landlord;</p>
          <p id="s1p472">(d) Tenant makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;</p>
          <p id="s1p473">(e) A receiver, trustee or custodian is appointed to or does take title, possession or control of all or substantially all of Tenant’s assets;</p>
          <p id="s1p474">(f) Tenant files a voluntary petition under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any successor statute (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “ Bankruptcy Code”) or an order for relief is entered against Tenant pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary proceeding commenced under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code;</p>
          <p id="s1p475">46</p>
          <p id="s1p476">(g) Any involuntary petition is filed against Tenant under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code and is not dismissed within one hundred twenty (120) days;</p>
          <p id="s1p477">(h) Tenant fails to deliver an estoppel certificate in accordance with Article 20 or a document required from Tenant under Article 30 above;</p>
          <p id="s1p478">(i) Tenant’s interest in this Lease is attached, executed upon or otherwise judicially seized and such action is not released within one hundred twenty (120) days of the action; or</p>
          <p id="s1p479">(j) Tenant fails to cure a breach of Section 16.4 above, where such failure continues for twenty (20) days after written notice thereof from Landlord; provided that, if the nature of Tenant’s default is such that it reasonably requires more than twenty (20) days to cure, Tenant shall not be deemed to be in Default if Tenant commences such cure within such twenty (20) day period and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion; and provided, further, that such cure is completed no later than ninety (90) days after Tenant’s receipt of written notice from Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p480">Notices given under this Section shall specify the alleged default and shall demand that Tenant perform the provisions of this Lease or pay the Rent that is in arrears, as the case may be, within the applicable period of time, or quit the Premises. No such notice shall be deemed a forfeiture or a termination of this Lease unless Landlord elects otherwise in such notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p481">31.5 In the event of a Default by Tenant, and at any time thereafter, with or without notice or demand and without limiting Landlord in the exercise of any right or remedy that Landlord may have, Landlord has the right to do any or all of the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p482">(a) Halt any Tenant Improvements and Alterations and order Tenant’s contractors, subcontractors, consultants, designers and material suppliers to stop work;</p>
          <p id="s1p483">(b) Terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises by written notice to Tenant or by any lawful means, in which case Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord. In such event, Landlord shall have the immediate right to re-enter and remove all persons and property, and such property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost and for the account of Tenant, all without service of notice or resort to legal process and without being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned thereby; and</p>
          <p id="s1p484">(c) Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord. In such event, Landlord shall have the immediate right to re-enter and remove all persons and property, and such property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost and for the account of Tenant, all without service of notice or resort to legal process and without being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned thereby. In the event that Landlord shall elect to so terminate this Lease, then Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant all damages incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant’s default, including:</p>
          <p id="s1p485">(i) The sum of:</p>
          <p id="s1p486">A. The worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent that had accrued at the time of such termination; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p487">47</p>
          <p id="s1p488">B. The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent that would have accrued during the period commencing with termination of the Lease and ending at the time of award exceeds that portion of the loss of Landlord’s rental income from the Premises that Tenant proves to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction could have been reasonably avoided; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p489">C. The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds that portion of the loss of Landlord’s rental income from the Premises that Tenant proves to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction could have been reasonably avoided; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p490">D. Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or that in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including the cost of restoring the Premises to the condition required under the terms of this Lease, including any rent payments not otherwise chargeable to Tenant (e.g., during any “free” rent period or rent holiday); plus</p>
          <p id="s1p491">E. At Landlord’s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by Applicable Laws; or</p>
          <p id="s1p492">(ii) At Landlord’s election, as minimum liquidated damages in addition to any (a) amounts paid or payable to Landlord pursuant to Section 31.5(c)(i)A prior to such election and (b) costs of restoring the Premises to the condition required under the terms of this Lease, an amount (the “Election Amount”) equal to either (y) the positive difference (if any, and measured at the time of such termination) between (1) the then-present value of the total Rent and other benefits that would have accrued to Landlord under this Lease for the remainder of the Term if Tenant had fully complied with the Lease minus (2) the then-present cash rental value of the Premises as determined by Landlord for what would be the then-unexpired Term if the Lease remained in effect, computed using the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of the award plus one (1) percentage point (the “Discount Rate”) or (z) twelve (12) months (or such lesser number of months as may then be remaining in the Term) of Base Rent and Additional Rent at the rate last payable by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, in either case as Landlord specifies in such election. Landlord and Tenant agree that the Election Amount represents a reasonable forecast of the minimum damages expected to occur in the event of a breach, taking into account the uncertainty, time and cost of determining elements relevant to actual damages, such as fair market rent, time and costs that may be required to re-lease the Premises, and other factors; and that the Election Amount is not a penalty.</p>
          <p id="s1p493">As used in Sections 31.5(c)(i)A and B, “worth at the time of award” shall be computed by allowing interest at the Default Rate. As used in Section 31.5(c)(i)C, the “worth at the time of the award” shall be computed by taking the present value of such amount, using the Discount Rate.</p>
          <p id="s1p494">31.6 In addition to any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity and under this Lease, Landlord may continue this Lease in effect after Tenant’s Default and abandonment and</p>
          <p id="s1p495">48</p>
          <p id="s1p496">recover Rent as it becomes due. In addition, Landlord shall not be liable in any way whatsoever for its failure or refusal to relet the Premises. For purposes of this Section, the following acts by Landlord will not constitute the termination of Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises:</p>
          <p id="s1p497">(a) Acts of maintenance or preservation or efforts to relet the Premises, including alterations, remodeling, redecorating, repairs, replacements or painting as Landlord shall consider advisable for the purpose of reletting the Premises or any part thereof; or</p>
          <p id="s1p498">(b) The appointment of a receiver upon the initiative of Landlord to protect Landlord’s interest under this Lease or in the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p499">Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Default by Tenant, Landlord may elect at any time to terminate this Lease and to recover damages to which Landlord is entitled.</p>
          <p id="s1p500">31.7 If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as provided in Section 31.5, then Landlord may, from time to time, recover all Rent as it becomes due under this Lease. At any time thereafter, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease and to recover damages to which Landlord is entitled.</p>
          <p id="s1p501">31.8 In the event Landlord elects to terminate this Lease and relet the Premises, Landlord may execute any new lease in its own name. Tenant hereunder shall have no right or authority whatsoever to collect any Rent from such tenant. The proceeds of any such reletting shall be applied as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p502">(a) First, to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord, including storage charges or brokerage commissions owing from Tenant to Landlord as the result of such reletting;</p>
          <p id="s1p503">(b) Second, to the payment of the costs and expenses of reletting the Premises, including (i) alterations and repairs that Landlord deems reasonably necessary and advisable and (ii) reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements incurred by Landlord in connection with the retaking of the Premises and such reletting;</p>
          <p id="s1p504">(c) Third, to the payment of Rent and other charges due and unpaid hereunder; and</p>
          <p id="s1p505">(d) Fourth, to the payment of future Rent and other damages payable by Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p506">31.9 All of Landlord’s rights, options and remedies hereunder shall be construed and held to be nonexclusive and cumulative. Landlord shall have the right to pursue any one or all of such remedies, or any other remedy or relief that may be provided by Applicable Laws, whether or not stated in this Lease. No waiver of any default of Tenant hereunder shall be implied from any acceptance by Landlord of any Rent or other payments due hereunder or any omission by Landlord to take any action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall affect defaults other than as specified in such waiver. Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Landlord shall be required to mitigate its damages with respect to any default by Tenant only to the extent required by Applicable Laws. Any obligation imposed by</p>

Landlord shall not be obligated to relet the Premises to any party to whom Landlord or an affiliate of Landlord may desire to lease other available space in the Project or at another property owned by Landlord or an affiliate of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p509">31.10 Landlord’s termination of (a) this Lease or (b) Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises shall not relieve Tenant of any liability to Landlord that has previously accrued or that shall arise based upon events that occurred prior to the later to occur of (y) the date of Lease termination and (z) the date Tenant surrenders possession of the Premises.</p>

In no event shall Tenant have the right to terminate or cancel this Lease or to withhold or abate rent or to set off any Claims against Rent as a result of any default or breach by Landlord of any of its covenants, obligations, representations, warranties or promises hereunder, except as may otherwise be expressly set forth in this Lease. In the event that Landlord shall fail or neglect to keep and perform any of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, and such failure or neglect is not remedied within thirty (30) days (or such additional period as is either otherwise provided herein or as may reasonably be required to correct the failure or neglect with the exercise of due diligence) after receipt of written notice from Tenant specifying the failure or neglect, then Tenant, shall be entitled to seek monetary damages from Landlord for such failure or neglect. Alternatively, If Landlord is in default under this Section 31.12 above of any of its obligations to maintain and repair the Building or any of the systems located in the Building that exclusively serve the Premises (as distinguished from those system in the Building that serve also other areas of the Project), other than as a result of damage or destruction that is governed by the provisions of Article 24 above or a taking by the exercise of the right of appropriation, condemnation or eminent domain that is governed by the provisions of Article 25 above (collectively referred to in this Section 31.12 as the “Self Help Obligations”), and if such default poses a material risk to the Tenant’s property or the health or safety of persons in the Premises, then Tenant may elect as Tenant’s sole and exclusive remedy to perform the Self Help Obligations, subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
          <p id="s1p512">(a) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord and each Mortgagee whose name and address has previously been furnished to Tenant in writing, notice of Tenant’s intention to perform such Self Help Obligations (the “ Self Help Notice”), which Self-Help Notice shall describe in reasonable</p>

          <p id="s1p514">detail Landlord’s default, state Tenant’s intention to exercise its self-help rights under this Section 31.12, including a reasonably detailed description of the Self Help Obligations Tenant intends to perform and, in the case of a Self Help Notice given to a Mortgagee, be given by registered or certified mail. If neither Landlord nor any Mortgagee commences to cure such default within five (5) business days after receipt of the Self Help Notice, then Tenant may take such action as is reasonably necessary to perform the Self Help Obligations identified in the Self Help Notice;</p>
          <p id="s1p515">(b) All Self Help Obligations performed by Tenant or its agents pursuant to this Section 31.12 shall be reasonably coordinated with Landlord and must be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, at a reasonable and competitive cost and rate, and shall not void any warranties or guarantees on the Premises or the Building; and</p>
          <p id="s1p516">(c) Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable out-of-pocket, third party costs of the performance of the Self Help Obligations that are incurred in accordance with the terms of this Section 31.12 (the “ Reimbursement Amount”) within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s submission to Landlord of Tenant’s bill therefor, accompanied by receipted, itemized invoices (with reasonable supporting documentation) and unconditional lien releases from all contractors, subcontractors, materialmen and suppliers that performed the work or provided the material or services reflected in such bill (“Tenant Reimbursement Request”). In the event Landlord fails to pay all or any portion of the Reimbursement Amount due Tenant under this Section 31.12(c) within said thirty (30)-day period, Tenant may as its sole remedy for such failure deduct the amount owed by Landlord from the next installment of Base Rent and each subsequent installment of Base Rent due under this Lease until Tenant is fully reimbursed for the Reimbursement Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord delivers to Tenant a good faith written objection within five (5) business days after receipt of Tenant’s Reimbursement Request setting forth with reasonable particularity Landlord’s reasons for its claim that Landlord is not required to pay all or any specified portion of the Reimbursement Amount, then Tenant shall not deduct said amount unless Landlord fails to pay such amount within thirty (30) days following a Final Determination in Tenant’s favor. As used herein, “Final Determination” means (i) any final unappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) any binding unappealable award granted in any arbitration proceeding in which Landlord and Tenant have agreed in writing to participate. In the event that Tenant obtains a Final Determination in Tenant’s favor, the Reimbursement Amount shall be increased to include interest on the Reimbursement Amount at an annual rate of eight percent (8%) per annum (with such interest commencing to accrue on the date Landlord receives the Tenant Reimbursement Request).</p>
          <p id="s1p517">31.13 In the event of any default by Landlord, provided Landlord has previously notified Tenant in writing of the name and address of its Mortgagee, Tenant shall give notice by registered or certified mail to any Mortgagee, and shall offer such Mortgagee a reasonable opportunity to cure the default, including time to obtain possession of the Building or the Project by power of sale or a judicial action if such should prove necessary to effect a cure.</p>

With regard to obligations imposed upon Landlord pursuant to this Lease, the term “Landlord,” as used in this Lease, shall refer only to Landlord or Landlord’s then-current successor-in-interest.

          <p id="s1p569">42.1 Base Rent during each Option term shall equal ninety-five percent (95%) of the then-current fair market value for comparable office and laboratory space in the Rockville, Maryland submarket of comparable age, quality, level of finish and proximity to amenities and public transit (“ FMV”). Tenant may, no more than six (6) months prior to the date the Term is then scheduled to expire, request Landlord’s estimate of the FMV for the next Option term. Landlord shall, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such request, give Tenant a written proposal of such FMV. If Tenant gives written notice to exercise an Option, such notice shall specify whether Tenant accepts Landlord’s proposed estimate of FMV. If Tenant does not accept the FMV, then the parties shall endeavor to agree upon the FMV, taking into account all relevant factors, including but not limited to (a) the size of the Premises, (b) the length of the Option term, (c) rent in comparable buildings in the relevant submarket, including rent escalations and concessions offered to new tenants, such as free rent, tenant improvement allowances and moving allowances, (d) Tenant’s creditworthiness, and (e) the quality and location of the Building and the Project.

          <p id="s1p571">agree upon the FMV within thirty (30) days after Tenant notifies Landlord that Tenant is exercising an Option, then either party may request that the same be determined as follows: a senior officer of a nationally recognized leasing brokerage firm with local knowledge of the Rockville, Maryland laboratory/research and development leasing submarket (the “Baseball Arbitrator”) shall be selected and paid for jointly by Landlord and Tenant. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Baseball Arbitrator, then the same shall be designated by the local chapter of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services or any successor organization thereto (the “JAMS”). The Baseball Arbitrator selected by the parties or designated by JAMS shall (y) have at least fifteen (15) years’ experience in the leasing of laboratory/research and development space in the Rockville, Maryland submarket and (z) not have been employed or retained by either Landlord or Tenant or any affiliate of either for a period of at least ten (10) years prior to appointment pursuant hereto. Each of Landlord and Tenant shall submit to the Baseball Arbitrator and to the other party its determination of the FMV. The Baseball Arbitrator shall grant to Landlord and Tenant a hearing and the right to submit evidence. The Baseball Arbitrator shall determine which of the two (2) FMV determinations more closely represents the actual FMV. The arbitrator may not select any other FMV for the Premises other than one submitted by Landlord or Tenant. The FMV selected by the Baseball Arbitrator shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant and shall serve as the basis for determination of Base Rent payable for the applicable Option term. If, as of the commencement date of an Option term, the amount of Base Rent payable during the Option term shall not have been determined, then, pending such determination, Tenant shall pay Base Rent equal to the Base Rent payable with respect to the last year of the then-current Term. After the final determination of Base Rent payable for the Option term, the parties shall promptly execute a written amendment to this Lease specifying the amount of Base Rent to be paid during the applicable Option term. Any failure of the parties to execute such amendment shall not affect the validity of the FMV determined pursuant to this Section.</p>

If Landlord has reasonable cause to believe that the Generator Plans may pose safety concerns for the Project or its occupants then, upon Landlord’s written request, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a report from a licensed engineering firm stating that the Generator Plans do not pose any safety concerns to the Project or its occupants, and that the Generator License Area</p>
          <p id="s1p891">J-1</p>
          <p id="s1p892">can safely accommodate Tenant’s Generator (the “Generator Report”). The installation of Tenant’s Generator, excluding any necessary penetration of the exterior of the Building or any other structure at the Project, shall be performed by Tenant’s contractor (which shall have been preapproved by Landlord). Landlord may retain the services of a structural or other engineer to monitor the installation of Tenant’s Generator and related equipment at no cost to Tenant, as well as to review the Generator Report, and Tenant shall comply with any recommendation in the Generator Report and those recommendations arising from Landlord’s review of same.</p>
          <p id="s1p893">5. Use; Testing. Tenant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct all testing and maintenance of Tenant’s Generator during Business Days after 6:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m. the next morning, or on weekends or holidays; provided, however, if a tenant or other occupant in the Project, or an adjacent property owner or neighbor complains to Tenant or Landlord, Tenant shall adjust Tenant’s testing and maintenance schedule to address the complaint. In addition, Tenant may test Tenant’s Generator during Business Hours (with each test lasting no Tenant’s than thirty (30) minutes in duration) in the event of the necessity of emergency repairs to the Tenant’s Generator.</p>
          <p id="s1p894">6. No Representations or Warranties. Landlord is not making any representation or warranty to Tenant regarding Tenant’s ability to install a generator at the Property in accordance with Applicable Laws and any CC&amp;Rs or as to the condition of the Approved Generator Area. Tenant acknowledges that (a) Tenant is responsible for ensuring that the installation of Tenant’s Generator in the Generator License Area is permitted under the Applicable Laws and any CC&amp;Rs, and (b) Tenant’s ability to install Tenant’s Generator in the Generator License Area (or elsewhere at the Project) is not a condition precedent to the obligations of Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p895">7. Right to Relocate. Landlord shall have a right from time to time if Landlord has reasonable cause to do so, to relocate the Approved Generator Area to a new location designated by Landlord and reasonably acceptable by Tenant, in which case, Tenant shall (subject to reimbursement as expressly set forth below and subject to the requirements of this Section 7), relocate Tenant’s Generator to the new Approved Generator Area (with the exact location of Tenant’s Generator within the new Approved Generator Area being designated by Tenant and from and after such relocation being the “Generator License Area”), repair any damage caused by such relocation, and the original Generator License Area to its condition prior to the installation of Tenant’s Generator. Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for Tenant’s reasonable, actual costs to relocate Tenant’s Generator to the new Generator License Area, to repair any reasonably expected damage caused by such relocation, and to restore the original Generator License Area, but in no event shall Landlord be obligated to reimburse Tenant for any costs to remove, remedy, contain or treat any Hazardous Materials placed in, on or about the original Generator License Area by any Tenant Party, which shall be the sole responsibility of Tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant’s Generator is not in compliance with this out-of-pocketExhibit J, then Tenant shall be solely responsible for the costs to comply, including, without limitation, the costs of removing or relocating Tenant’s Generator if required as a result of any non-compliance.</p>
          <p id="s1p896">8. Removal. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Tenant’s Generator shall remain in the Generator License Area and shall be surrendered to Landlord, or at Landlord’s</p>
          <p id="s1p897">J-2</p>
          <p id="s1p898">option, Tenant shall remove the Generator, repair any damage caused by such removal, and otherwise restore the Generator License Area to its condition prior to the installation of Tenant’s Generator. Removal of the Generator shall include (i) complete removal and proper de-commissioning of the Generator and the connecting lines in their entirety by a licensed electrician, and (ii) complete removal of any the fuel tanks (and the Property remediated, as necessary), by a technician/contractor who is properly licensed to conduct such removal and remediation in accordance with Applicable Laws. If Tenant fails to so remove Tenant’s Generator within thirty (30) days following the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, then, at the option of Landlord, Tenant’s Generator shall be deemed abandoned and may be claimed by Landlord or removed and disposed of by Landlord at Tenant’s expense. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any costs and expenses incident to such removal, storage and disposal of Tenant’s Generator.</p>
          <p id="s1p899">9. Landlord Exculpation. Without limiting the provisions of Section 23.6 of this Lease, Tenant assumes full responsibility for protecting from theft or damage Tenant’s Generator and any other tools or equipment that Tenant may use in connection with the installation, operation, use, repair, maintenance, replacement, upgrade or removal of Tenant’s Generator, assumes all risk of theft, loss or damage, and waives all Claims with respect thereto against the Landlord Parties, including any Claims caused by any active or passive act or omission of any Landlord Party or by any act or omission for which liability without fault or strict liability may be imposed, except only, with respect to any Landlord Party, to the extent such injury, death or damage is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Landlord Party and not covered by the insurance required to be carried by Tenant hereunder, or except to the extent such limitation on liability is prohibited by Applicable Laws. Further, in no event shall any Landlord Parties be liable under any circumstances for any consequential damages or for injury or damage to, or interference with, Tenant’s business, including, but not limited to, loss of profits, loss of rents or other revenues, loss of business opportunity, loss of goodwill or loss of use, resulting from damage to, or any failure or interruption of use of, Tenant’s Generator, however occurring. The foregoing provisions of this Section 9 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p900">10. Insurance; Indemnification. Tenant shall cause the insurance policies required to be maintained pursuant to Section 23.3 of this Lease to cover the installation, presence, use, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, upgrading and removal of Tenant’s Generator. Without limiting the provisions of Section 28.1 of this Lease, Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless the Landlord Parties from any Claims suffered or imposed upon or asserted against any Landlord Party in connection with or arising from the use or operation by any Tenant Parties of Tenant’s Generator, whether occurring before, during, or after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term. The foregoing indemnification shall apply regardless of any active or passive negligence of the Landlord Parties and regardless of whether liability without fault or strict liability may be imposed upon the Landlord Parties; provided, however, that, with respect to any Landlord Party, Tenant’s obligations under this Section 10 shall be inapplicable (a) to the extent such Claims arise or result from the negligence or willful misconduct of such Landlord Party or (b) to the extent such obligations are prohibited by Applicable Laws. The foregoing provisions of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.</p>
