For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will this Section 4(c)(ii) restrict Tower Operators ability to enter into any pre-paid ground lease or perpetual easement which does not include (A) the payment of additional amounts beyond the term of this Agreement, and (B) atypical non-monetary performance requirements that would be required to be performed beyond the term of the this Agreement.</p>

The applicable Verizon Lessor and Tower Operator shall attempt, in good faith, to agree on the fair market value of such Non-Severable Modifications by a date that is 240 days prior to the Purchase Option Closing Date for such Purchase Option or, alternatively, shall attempt, in good faith, by the same date to agree on an independent qualified appraiser to determine the fair market value of such Non-Severable Modifications. Absent agreement on value or on an appraiser as of 180 days before the Purchase Option Closing Date, each of such Verizon Lessor and Tower Operator shall identify an independent qualified appraiser within 10 days thereafter. If either party fails to appoint an appraiser within such 10-day period, the appraiser appointed by the other party shall alone determine the fair market value. If two appraisers are appointed and such appraisers cannot agree on the fair market value of such Non-Severable Modifications within 10 days after the appointment of the second appraiser, each such appraiser shall identify a third independent qualified appraiser who shall alone determine the fair market value of such Non-Severable Modifications; provided that if such two appraisers cannot agree on the identity of such third appraiser within 10 days after the appointment of the second appraiser, either party may apply to the American Arbitration Association for the appointment of such third appraiser. The purpose of the preceding appraisal procedures is to provide the parties with a figure for the fair market value of the subject Non-Severable Modifications no later than 140 days before the Purchase Option Closing Date for such Purchase Option.</p>

          <p id="s1p610">(ii) The Indemnifying Party may assume and control the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party by accepting its obligation to defend in writing and agreeing to pay defense costs (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses) within 30 days of receiving notice of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party declines to indemnify as required, fails to respond to the notice, or fails to assume defense (or cause its insurer to assume defense) of the Third Party Claim within such 30-day period, then the Indemnified Party may control the defense and the Indemnifying Party shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket defense costs as incurred by the Indemnified Party. The Party that is not controlling the defense of the Third Party Claim shall have the right to participate in the defense and to retain separate counsel at its cost and expense. The Party that is controlling the defense shall use reasonable efforts to inform the other Party about the status of the defense. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith in the defense of any Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines,</p>

If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages.</p>
          <p id="s1p613">(iii) The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising out of or in connection with, any Third Party Claim, without the consent of any Indemnified Party (provided that the Indemnified Party may not withhold its consent if such settlement, compromise or judgment involves solely the payment of money without any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing and will not create, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, or adverse precedent with respect to the third party or any other person similarly situated as the third party with respect to other similar Third Party Claims or reasonably anticipated potential similar Third Party Claims). The Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement, compromise or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, compromise or entry of judgment and shall obtain, as a condition of any settlement, compromise or entry of judgment, a complete and unconditional release of each relevant Indemnified Party from any and all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim.</p>
          <p id="s1p614">(iv) For indemnification Claims other than Third Party Claims, the Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim for indemnification, describing in reasonable detail the basis for such Claim. Within 30 days following receipt of this notice, the Indemnifying Party shall respond, stating whether it disputes the existence or scope of an obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Section 15. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond within 30 days, the Indemnified Party shall send a second notice to the Indemnifying Party, marked at the top in bold lettering with the following language: A RESPONSE IS REQUIRED WITHIN 10 BUSINESS DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF A MASTER PREPAID LEASE WITH THE UNDERSIGNED AND FAILURE TO RESPOND SHALL RESULT IN YOUR RIGHT TO OBJECT BEING WAIVED and the envelope containing the request must be marked PRIORITY. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 10 Business Days after the receipt of such second notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under Section 15(a) or Section 15(b), as applicable, such Claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under Section 15(a) or Section 15(b), as applicable, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Claim to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the Claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party timely disputes the existence or scope of an obligation to indemnify for the Claim, it shall explain in reasonable detail the basis for the dispute. If the Parties disagree on the scope or existence of an indemnification obligation for the Claim, management representatives of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall meet or confer by telephone within 20 Business Days in an attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute.

Tower Operator shall promptly notify the Verizon Indemnitee in writing of any proposed settlement, compromise or judgment relating to a Third Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail the proposed settlement, compromise or judgment. Such Verizon Indemnitee may assume and control the discussions relating to such settlement, compromise or judgment by accepting such responsibility in writing and agreeing to pay the costs (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses) within 30 days of receiving notice of such proposed settlement, compromise or judgment. If the Verizon Indemnitee declines, fails to respond to the notice, or fails to assume the settlement, compromise or judgment discussions within such 30-day period, then the Tower Operator may control the settlement, compromise or judgment discussions. The Party that is not controlling the negotiations of the settlement, compromise or judgment shall have the right to participate in the negotiation discussions and to retain separate counsel at its cost and expense. The Party that is controlling the negotiations shall use reasonable efforts to inform the other Party about the status of the negotiations. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith in the settlement, compromise or judgment negotiations. Tower Operator shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement, compromise or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, compromise or entry of judgment and obtain, as a condition of any settlement, compromise or entry of judgment, a complete and unconditional release of each relevant Verizon Indemnitee from any and all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim the settlement, compromise or entry of judgment with respect thereto.</p>
