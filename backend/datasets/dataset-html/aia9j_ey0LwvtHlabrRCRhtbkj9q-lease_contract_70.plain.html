          <p id="s1p19">Changhe and Zhongtulian are collectively referred to as the &quot;Parties&quot;, and individually as the &quot;Party&quot;.</p>
          <p id="s1p20">Purpose</p>
          <p id="s1p21">This Contract is made to define lease of the premise more particularly set forth hereinafter. For this end, the Parties rely on equality and freewill basis and negotiation hereby agreed as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p22">Terms of Agreement</p>
          <p id="s1p23">1. General</p>
          <p id="s1p24">The premise to lease is identified as &quot;Premise&quot; hereinafter. Information as to this Premise, lease period, rent, security deposit, PMF (Property management fee), and standard rate as to miscellaneous charges as well as payment terms are referred to Schedule 1 appended hereinafter.</p>
          <p id="s1p25">2. Lease purpose &amp; utilization policy</p>
          <p id="s1p26">1. Changhe admits and Zhongtulian recognizes this Premise has and serves complex purpose as per housing planning (Purpose). Zhongtulian undertakes to utilize this Premise subject to this Purpose. Zhongtulian may and shall at its sole discretion, decide whether this Purpose will meet its true intention of premise utilization, and shall thereby accept liability for such utilization on its own. On no circumstance shall Changhe accept any liability and obligation whatsoever for this Purpose adequate or not to satisfy Zhongtulian's intention of premise utilization.</p>
          <p id="s1p27">1</p>
          <p id="s1p28">[ENGLISH TRANSLATION ONLY FOR CONVENIENCE.</p>
          <p id="s1p29">NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION.]</p>
          <p id="s1p30">2. Zhongtulian shall comply with provisions as prescribed by Changhe and PSP (Property service provider appointed to manage the Tower at which this Premise is housed), including but without limitation to Tenant Handbook and Decoration Works Manual (collectively the &quot;Settlement Documents&quot;). These Settlement Documents are constituted as integral part to this Contract. Without prejudice to Zhongtulian's business activity in ordinary course, PSP shall and may change these Settlement Documents at any time with view to the Tower, as the case may be. These Settlement Documents after the latest change shall thereby become a part integrated to this Contract and Zhongtulian shall otherwise be duly informed of these Settlement Documents after such change under written notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">3. Rent, miscellaneous charges, payment terms</p>
          <p id="s1p32">1. Zhongtulian has the duty to settle payables as identified in this Contract. These payables shall include but without limited to the Rent (charges payable to Changhe at Zhongtulian’s account to settle possession of this Premise for lease period), PMF (Property management fee) and Miscellaneous Charges (Collectively the &quot;Payables&quot;).</p>
          <p id="s1p33">Zhongtulian's failure to settle the Payables is constituted as Event of Default. This Event of Default and/or failure to have Changhe and PSP thereby compensated at financial loss that arises from the same Event of Default shall entitle Changhe / PSP (but not obligated) to deduct compensation sum at such financial loss from Security Deposit (defined hereinafter). After deduction, Zhongtulian shall suffice the Security Deposit 3 days since after deduction date; provided the part of Security Deposit to suffice is waivered from interest accrual. This Security Deposit after deduction of receivables due to Changhe/PSP is refundable at termination of this Contract 30 days only after Zhongtulian has fulfilled obligations as identified in the Contract (provided always the part of Security Deposit to refund is not accrued of bearing interest). Where this Premise is caused to renew taken valid as from expiry of the Lease Period (defined hereinafter), the balance of Security Deposit previously paid is accepted to become a part of deposit applicable to renewal period and refundable at excess sum or payable due from Zhongtulian at receivable sum.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">2. The date at which Changhe/ PSP has receipt of non-cash payment for these Payables via transfer to specified account is constituted as settlement date (Settlement Date)and Zhongtulian is thereby deemed to have fulfilled payment duty.</p>
          <p id="s1p35">Changhe/PSP may change opening bank and account; provided Zhongtulian shall be prior informed under a 10 business days notice in writing.</p>
          <p id="s1p36">3. If the Settlement Date is an off day (non-business day), these Payables shall be made at the final business day preceding the non-business day.</p>
          <p id="s1p37">4. Any tax that arises from this Contract shall be spilt to settle at each Party's account in accordance with legal statutes. After payment of the Rent, PMF and Miscellaneous Charges, Changhe/PSP (beneficiary) shall invoice at receivables, except the Security Deposit (receipt is issued against Security Deposit after receipt). Zhongtulian is aware and understands that Changhe/PSP is waivered from issue of deductible VAT invoice. In this case, Changhe/PSP is thereby reduced to the liability to have Zhongtulian compensated or indemnified against failure to issue the deductible VAT invoice.</p>
          <p id="s1p38">2</p>
          <p id="s1p39">[ENGLISH TRANSLATION ONLY FOR CONVENIENCE.</p>
          <p id="s1p40">NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION.]</p>
          <p id="s1p41">4. Delivery, renewal, return</p>
          <p id="s1p42">1. At contract execution, Zhongtulian has full receipt of status quo that reflects the Premise and the Tower and facilities adjacent (e.g. roads, buildings), state of ownership in title of Premise and the Tower, government approvals, as well as possible influence that may arise from utilization of this Premise. After due investigation, Zhongtulian has acquired the facts above without question and whereby agrees to settle at Changhe's delivery of this Premise (Delivery) at AS IS state (including physical &amp; legal state).

This Premise at AS IS state shall be caused to deliver for Zhongtulian's settlement three (3) days since after date of the first down payment of the Rent and Security Deposit payable to Changhe (Delivery). Zhongtulian and Changhe shall process settlement procedures to take effect this Delivery. This Delivery is deemed to complete since after field survey/inspection and key delivery. The date at which Zhongtulian and Changhe sign and seal on the Delivery Summary is deemed as Delivery Date. If the delivery procedures are failed to process at scheduled or the Delivery Summary is failed to sign, the third day after receipt of the first down payment of the Rent and Security Deposit from Zhongtulian is accepted as the Delivery Date and Changhe shall thereby be deemed to have fulfilled its duty of premise delivery. The Lease Period, Rent Holiday (inclusive of decoration works period) identified in this Contract are kept intact without change.</p>
          <p id="s1p44">3. Zhongtulian may reflect intention to renew the Lease Period under a notice in writing (Renewal Notice) three (3) months prior to its end. At equal terms and conditions, Zhongtulian has the priority to renew the Lease Period; provided renewal details shall be caused to define under prior negotiation with Changhe together. After post-negotiation acceptance, Changhe may enter into renewal agreement with Zhongtulian to take effect another Lease Period. Zhongtulian shall be treated to waiver renewal so long as this Renewal Notice is late to issue or renewal agreement is failed to sign three (3) months on and before the current Lease Period at its expiry. In this case, the Contract shall end at its expiry.</p>
          <p id="s1p45">4. This Premise shall be returned to Changhe three (3) days since after end of this Contract. At return, this Premise shall be in clean and good conditions. Within the Premise, corridor walls after previous removal (these walls after removal shall be replaced with glass walls, whose upper opening has vent to enable air circulation) shall be recovered back to the initial state. Return procedures are processed together only after these walls are completed for recovery. After removal of private goods off from this Premise and return of the key, Zhongtulian shall return the premise to Changhe and finish conducting the procedures that deregister/change the Premise as registered place of business (e.g. energy supply account is ascribed to Zhongtulian in its name, this account shall be transferred to Changhe or its designee of third party seven (7) days since after contract end); sign Delivery Summary with Changhe to acknowledge the Premise at return. This Delivery Summary is worked to reflect the state of Premise at return only and Zhongtulian is not thereby treated as fully discharged its duty to return, unless this Delivery Summary has Changhe's notes that acknowledge this Premise meets return conditions and this return has taken effect. Zhongtulian shall use efforts to process and finish troubles or defects as mentioned in the Delivery Summary to take effect the return and removal or may alternatively appoint Changhe to do so in its stead; provided Changhe shall thereby be paid compensation to cover the cost of services as appointed above.</p>
          <p id="s1p46">3</p>
          <p id="s1p47">[ENGLISH TRANSLATION ONLY FOR CONVENIENCE.</p>
          <p id="s1p48">NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSLATION.]</p>
          <p id="s1p49">For the purpose of remnants left at the Premise at end of return period, Zhongtulian consents these remnants are vested to Changhe as title owner through conveyance without charge. Changhe is at liberty to dispose these remnants and charge at Zhongtulian's account to settle disposal costs. If this Premise is late to return, Zhongtulian shall, at cancellation/termination date of this Contract, settle possession fee, PMF and miscellaneous charges at the sum twice as much as the standard rate of current daily rent and PMF payable to Changhe for late period and otherwise have Changhe compensated at resulting loss of any description that arises from late return. This compensation is valid until the Premise is returned at the state consistent to return conditions as identified herein; provided that possession fee and compensation sum are not workable as continuation to take effect premise renewal or lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p50">In addition to the agreements above, Changhe may, immediately after the end date of this Contract, take action to cease energy supply and provision of PMS to the Premise in full or in part; change premise door lock, vacate the Premise; remove or dispose Zhongtulian's goods such as decorations, facilities installed at the Premise(the right to remove or dispose shall not be interpreted as Changhe's duty to keep decorations, facilities with due prudence, and Changhe is waivered from compensation due to Zhongtulian) ; provided costs in removal or disposal above are at Zhongtulian's charge to settle.</p>
          <p id="s1p51">5. Premise-Decoration works, renovation</p>

          <p id="s1p53">2. Upon contract execution, Zhongtulian shall present the Decoration Design Plan (construction drawings inclusive) to Changhe/PSP prior to the commencement of Decoration Works at site of the Premise.
