If Lessor uses or applies all or any portion of said Security Deposit, Lessee shall within ten (10) days after written request therefor deposit monies with Lessor sufficient to restore said Security Deposit to the full amount required by this Lease. If the Base Rent increases during the term of this Lease, Lessee shall, upon written request from Lessor, deposit additional monies with Lessor so that the total amount of the Security Deposit shall at all times bear the same proportion to the increased Base Rent as the initial Security Deposit bore to the Initial Base Rent. Should the Use (Paragraph 1.4) be amended to accommodate a material change in the business of Lessee or to accommodate a sublessee or assignee, Lessor shall have the right to increase the Security Deposit to the extent necessary, in Lessor's reasonable judgment, to account for any increased wear and tear that the Premises may suffer as a result thereof. If a change in control of Lessee occurs during this Lease and following such change the financial condition of Lessee is, in Lessor's reasonable judgment, significantly reduced, Lessee shall deposit such additional monies with Lessor as shall be sufficient to cause the Security Deposit to be at a commercially reasonable level based on said change in financial condition. Lessor shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general accounts. Within fourteen (14) days after the expiration or termination of this Lease, if Lessor elects to apply the Security Deposit only to unpaid Rent, and otherwise within thirty (30) days after the Premises have been vacated pursuant to Paragraph 7.2(b) below, Lessor shall return that portion of the Security Deposit not used or applied by Lessor. No part of the Security Deposit shall be considered to be held in trust, to bear interest or to be prepayment for any monies to be paid by Lessee under this Lease. It is specifically understood that Lessee shall have no right at any time to apply said Security Deposit, or any portion thereof, to any of its Rent obligations (including its last month’s Rent) or to any other sums due and payable by Lessee under this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p172">12.4 Additional Terms and Conditions Applicable to Assignment and Subletting. It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Lease shall confer upon Lessee only the right to use and occupy the Premises and to exercise such other rights as are conferred upon Lessee by this Lease. The parties agree that this Lease is not intended to have a bonus or enhanced value to Lessee, nor to serve as a vehicle whereby Lessee may profit by a future assignment or sublet of this Lease of a right to use or occupy the Premises as a result of any favorable terms contained herein or any favorable changes in the market for commercial lease space. It is the intent of the parties that any such bonus or enhanced value that may attach to this Lease shall be and remain the exclusive property of the Lessor. In order to carry out this intent, in the event Lessee seeks to assign or transfer its interest in this Lease of the Premises, Lessor shall have the following options which may be exercised at its sole election, without limiting Lessor in the exercise of any other right or remedy at law or equity or under this Lease which Lessor may have by reason of such proposed assignment or sublet.</p>
          <p id="s1p173">(a) Lessor may terminate this Lease and release Lessee from any further rental obligations thereunder by sending Lessee written notice of such termination within forty -five (45) days after notice of intent to assign or sublet is deemed given by Lessee, provided, however, that Lessee may withdraw its notice of intent by written notice to Lessor at any time within ten (10) days after receipt by Lessee of Lessor=s notice of termination, in which event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If Lessor elects to terminate this Lease and if Lessee does not withdraw its notice of intent, Lessee shall surrender the Premises pursuant to the terms of this Lease, within sixty (60) days after notice of intent to transfer is deemed given by Lessee and on such date as designated by Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p174">(b) Lessor may, within forty-five (45) days after notice of intent to assign or sublet is deemed given by Lessee, acquire the interest in this Lease and the Premises that Lessee proposed to assign or sublet, on the same terms and conditions as the proposed assignment or sublet.</p>
          <p id="s1p175">(c) Lessor may consent to the proposed assignment or sublet, provided that as a condition to such consent, Lessor shall have the right to require that any and all rent paid by the assignee tenant or subtenant, including, without limitation, any rent in excess of the rentals to be paid under this Lease shall be paid directly to Lessor at the time and place specified in this Lease. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term Arent@ shall include any consideration of any kind received, or to be received from the assignee tenant or subtenant. If such sums are related to Lessee=s interest in the Lease or in the Premises, including, without limitation, expense reimbursements or advances, the value of services performed, key money, bonus money and/or payments for Lessee=s personal property in excess of the book value of such property. The term Apersonal property@ as used in this paragraph shall include, without limitation, assets, fixtures, inventories, accounts, good will, equipment, furniture, general intangibles, and any capital stock or other equity ownership interest of Lessee.</p>

          <p id="s1p178">(a) The abandonment of the Premises; or the vacating of the Premises without providing a commercially reasonable level of security, and/or Security Deposit or where the coverage of the property insurance described in Paragraph 8.1 is jeopardized as a result thereof, or without providing reasonable assurances to minimize potential vandalism.</p>
          <p id="s1p179">(b) The failure of Lessee to make any payment of Rent, Operating Expense, or any Security Deposit required to be made by Lessee hereunder, whether to Lessor or to a third party, when due, to provide reasonable evidence of insurance or surety bond, or to fulfill any obligation under this Lease which endangers or threatens life or property, where such failure continues for a period of three (3) days following written notice to Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p180">(c) The failure by Lessee to provide (i) reasonable written evidence of compliance with Applicable Requirements, (ii) the service contracts, (iii) the rescission of an unauthorized Assignment or Subletting, (iv) a Tenancy Statement, (v) a requested subordination, (vi) evidence concerning any guaranty and/or Guarantor, (vii) any document requested under Paragraph 40 (easements), or (viii) any other documentation or information which Lessor may reasonably require of Lessee under the terms of this Lease, where any such failure continues for a period of three (3) days following written notice to Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p181">(d) A Default by Lessee as to the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Lease, or of the attached rules adopted hereunder including, without limitation, Vehicle Parking (Paragraph 2.2), Security Deposit (Paragraph 5), Use (Paragraph 6), Maintenance and Alterations (Paragraphs 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4), Utilities (Paragraph 11), Assignment and Subletting (Paragraph 12), Lessor=s Access (Paragraph 32), Hazardous Substances (Paragraph 49), where such Default continues for a period of three (3) days after written notice.</p>

Sec. 101 or any successor statute thereto (unless, in the case of a petition filed against Lessee, the same is dismissed within sixty (60) days); (iii) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to Lessee within thirty (30) days; or (iv) the attachment, execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged within thirty (30) days; provided, however, in the event that any provision of this subparagraph (e) is contrary to any applicable law, such provision shall be of no force or effect, and not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.</p>
          <p id="s1p183">(f) The discovery that any financial statement of Lessee or of any Guarantor given to Lessor was materially false.</p>
          <p id="s1p184">(g) If the performance of Lessee's obligations under this Lease is guaranteed (i) the death of a Guarantor; (ii) the termination of a Guarantor's liability with respect to this Lease other than in accordance with the terms of such guaranty; (iii) a Guarantor's becoming insolvent or the subject of a bankruptcy filing; (iv) a Guarantor's refusal to honor the guaranty; or (v) a Guarantor's breach of its guaranty obligation on an anticipatory basis, and Lessee's failure, within sixty (60) days following written notice of any such event, to provide written alternative assurance or security, which, when coupled with the then existing resources of Lessee, equals or exceeds the combined financial resources of Lessee and the Guarantors that existed at the time of execution of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p185">(h) In the event Lessee has one or more additional leases for other premises in the Office Building Project, then it is acknowledged and agreed that a default under such additional lease(s) shall also constitute a default under this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p190">13.2 Remedies. If Lessee fails to perform any of its affirmative duties or obligations, within ten (10) days after written notice (or in case of an emergency, without notice), Lessor may, at its option, perform such duty or obligation on Lessee's behalf, including but not limited to the obtaining of reasonably required bonds, insurance policies, or governmental licenses, permits or approvals. The costs and expenses of any such performance by Lessor shall be due and payable by Lessee upon receipt of invoice therefore. If any check given to Lessor by Lessee shall not be honored by the bank upon which it is drawn, Lessor, at its option, may require all future payments to be made by Lessee to be by cashier's check. In the event of a Breach, Lessor may, with or without further notice or demand, and without limiting Lessor in the exercise of any right or remedy, which Lessor may have by reason of such Breach:</p>
          <p id="s1p191">(a) Terminate Lessee's right to possession of the Premises by any lawful means, in which case this Lease shall terminate and Lessee shall immediately surrender possession to Lessor. In such event Lessor shall be entitled to recover from Lessee (i) the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination; (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Lessee proves could be reasonably avoided: and (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by the Lessee's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including but not limited to the cost of recovering possession of the Premises, expenses of reletting, including necessary renovation and alteration of the Premises, reasonable attorneys' fees, and that portion of any leasing commission paid by Lessor in connection with this Lease applicable to the unexpired term of this Lease. The worth at the time of award of the amount referred to in provision (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of the District within which the Premises are located at the time of award plus one percent (1%). Efforts by Lessor to mitigate damages caused by Lessee's Breach of this Lease shall not waive Lessor's right to recover damages under Paragraph 12.If termination of this Lease is obtained through the provisional remedy of unlawful detainer, Lessor shall have the right to recover in such proceeding any unpaid Rent and damages as are recoverable therein, or Lessor may reserve the right to recover all or any part thereof in a separate suit. If a notice and grace period required under Paragraph 13.1 were not previously given, a notice to pay rent or quit, or to perform or quit given to Lessee under the unlawful detainer statute shall also constitute the notice required by Paragraph 13.1. In such case, the applicable grace period required by Paragraph 13.1 and the unlawful detainer statute shall run concurrently, and the failure of Lessee to cure the Default within the greater of the two such grace periods shall constitute both an unlawful detainer and a Breach of this Lease entitling Lessor to the remedies provided for in this Lease and/or by said statute.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">(b) Continue this Lease and Lessee's right to possession and recover the Rent as it becomes due, in which event Lessee may sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations, as described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4. Acts of maintenance, efforts to re-let, and/or the appointment of a receiver to protect the Lessor's interests, shall not constitute a termination of the Lessee's right to possession.</p>
          <p id="s1p193">(c) Pursue any other remedy now or hereafter available under the laws or judicial decisions of the state wherein the Premises are located. The expiration or termination of this Lease and/or the termination of Lessee's right to possession shall not relieve Lessee from liability under any indemnity provisions of this Lease as to matters occurring or accruing during the term hereof or by reason of Lessee's occupancy of the premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p194">13.3 Inducement Recapture. Any agreement for free or abated rent or other charges, or for the giving or paying by Lessor to or for Lessee of any cash or other bonus, inducement or consideration for Lessee's entering into this Lease, all of which concessions are hereinafter referred to as &quot;Inducement Provisions,&quot; shall be deemed conditioned upon Lessee's full and faithful performance of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. Upon Breach of this Lease by Lessee, any such Inducement Provision shall automatically be deemed deleted from this Lease and of no further force or effect, and any rent, other charge, bonus, inducement or consideration theretofore abated, given or paid by Lessor under such an inducement Provision shall be immediately due and payable by Lessee to Lessor, notwithstanding any subsequent cure of said Breach by Lessee The acceptance by Lessor of rent or the cure of the Breach which initiated the operation of this paragraph shall not be deemed a waiver by Lessor of the provisions of this paragraph unless specifically so stated in writing by Lessor at the time of such acceptance.</p>
          <p id="s1p195">13.4 Late Charges. Lessee hereby acknowledges that late payment by Lessee of Rent will cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges, and late charges that may be imposed upon Lessor by any Lender. Accordingly, if any Rent shall not be received by Lessor within five (5) days after such amount shall be due, then, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, Lessee shall pay to Lessor a one-time late charge equal to six percent (6%) of each such overdue amount. The parties hereby agree that such late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Lessor will incur by reason of such late payment. Acceptance of such late charge by Lessor shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to such overdue amount, nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder. In the event that a late charge is payable hereunder, whether or not collected, for three (3) consecutive installments of Base Rent, then notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Base Rent shall, at Lessor's option, become due and payable quarterly in advance.</p>
          <p id="s1p196">13.5 Returned Check Charges. Lessee hereby acknowledges and agrees that a service charge of $50.00 will be assessed and charged to Lessee for each check that is returned because of insufficient funds.</p>
          <p id="s1p197">13.6 Notice to Pay Rent Charge. Lessee hereby acknowledges and agrees that a charge of $75.00 will be assessed and charged to Lessee for each Three Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit (or other termination notice based on Default) served on Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p198">14. CONDEMNATION. If the Premises or any portion thereof or the Office Building Project are taken under the power of eminent domain, or sold under the threat of the exercise of said power (all of which are herein called &quot;condemnation&quot;), this Lease shall terminate as to the part so taken as of the date the condemning authority takes title or possession, whichever first occurs; provided that if so much of the Premises or the Office Building Project are taken by such condemnation as would substantially and adversely affect the operation and profitability of Lessee's business conducted from the Premises, Lessee shall have the option, to be exercised only in writing within thirty (30) days after Lessor shall have given Lessee written notice of such taking (or in the absence of such notice, within thirty (30) days after the condemning authority shall have taken possession), to terminate this Lease as of the date the condemning authority takes such possession. If Lessee does not terminate this Lease in accordance with the foregoing, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect as to the portion of the Premises remaining, except that the rent shall be reduced in the proportion that the floor area of the Premises taken bears to the total floor area of the Premises, Common Areas taken shall be excluded from the Common Areas usable by Lessee and no reduction of rent shall occur with respect thereto or by reason thereof. Lessor shall have the option in its sole discretion to terminate this Lease as of the taking of possession by the condemning authority, by giving written notice to Lessee of such election within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of a taking by condemnation of any part of the Premises or the Office Building Project Any award for the taking of all or any part of the Premises or the Office Building Project under the power of eminent domain or any diminution in value of the leasehold or for the taking of the fee, or as severance damages; provided, however, that Lessee shall be entitled to any separate award for loss of or damage to Lessee's trade fixtures, removable personal property and unamortized tenant improvements that have been paid for by Lessee. For that purpose the cost of such improvements shall be amortized over the original term of this Lease excluding any options. In the event that this Lease is not terminated by reason of such condemnation, Lessor shall to the extent of severance damages received by Lessor in connection with such condemnation, repair any damage to the Premises caused by such condemnation except to the extent that Lessee has been reimbursed therefor by the condemning authority. Lessee shall pay any amount in excess of such severance damages required to complete such repair.</p>

          <p id="s1p205">(b) At the requesting party=s option, the failure to deliver such statement within such time shall be a material default of this Lease by the party who is to respond, without any further notice to such party, or it shall be conclusive upon such party that (i) this Lease is in full force and effect, without modification except as may be represented by the requesting party, (ii) there are not uncured defaults in the requesting party's performance, and (iii) if Lessor is the requesting party, not more than one month's rent has been paid in advance.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">(c) If Lessor desires to finance, refinance, or sell the Office Building Project, or any part thereof, Lessee hereby agrees to deliver to any lender or purchaser designated by Lessor such financial statements of Lessee as may be reasonably required by such lender or purchaser. Such statements shall include the past three (3) years financial statements of Lessee. All such financial statements shall be received by Lessor and such lender or purchaser in confidence and shall be used only for the purposes herein set forth.</p>
          <p id="s1p207">16. LESSOR'S LIABILITY. The term &quot;Lessor&quot; as used herein shall mean only the owner or owners, at the time in question, of the fee title or a lessee's interest in a ground lease of the Office Building Project. In the event of any transfer of such title or interest, Lessor herein named (and in case of any subsequent transfers then the grantor) shall be relieved from and after the date of such transfer of all liability as respects Lessor's obligations thereafter to be performed, provided that any funds in the hands of Lessor or the then grantor at the time of such transfer, in which Lessee has an interest, shall be delivered to the grantee. The obligations contained in this Lease to be performed by Lessor shall, subject as aforesaid, be binding on Lessor's successors and assigns only during their respective periods of ownership.</p>
          <p id="s1p208">17. SEVERABILITY. The invalidity of any provision of this Lease as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction shall in no way affect the validity of any other provision hereof.</p>

Except as expressly herein provided, any amount due to Lessor not paid when due shall bear interest at the maximum rate then allowable by law or judgments from the date due. Payment of such interest shall not excuse or cure any default by Lessee under this Lease; provided, however, that interest shall not be payable on late charges incurred by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p210">19. TIME OF ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with respect to the obligations to be performed under this Lease.</p>

All monetary obligations of Lessee to Lessor under the terms of this Lease, including but not limited to late charges, Three-Day Notice charges (Paragraph 13.6), returned check charges, attorney's fees and any other expenses payable by Lessee hereunder shall be deemed to be rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p212">20.1 Credits to Lessee's Account. Lessor shall promptly credit Lessee's account for all payments received from Lessee. Such payments shall be first credited to those sums due under this Lease Agreement, including but not limited to Base Rent, late charges, 3-Day Notice charges (Paragraph 13.6), returned check fees and attorney's fees which were incurred earliest in time (oldest chargeable items). Nothing in this paragraph (including Lessor's acceptance of a partial payment on account balance) shall be construed or constitute a waiver by Lessor of any provision hereof or of any subsequent breach by Lessee of the same or any other provision.</p>
          <p id="s1p213">21. INCORPORATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS; AMENDMENTS. This Lease contains all agreements of the parties with respect to any matter mentioned herein.

          <p id="s1p215">23. WAIVERS. No waiver by Lessor of any provision hereof shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision hereof or of any subsequent breach by Lessee of the same or any other provision. Lessor's consent to, or approval of, any act shall not be deemed to render unnecessary the obtaining of Lessor's consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Lessee. The acceptance of rent hereunder by Lessor shall not be a waiver of any preceding breach by Lessee of any provision hereof, other than the failure of Lessee to pay the particular rent so accepted, regardless of Lessor's knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p216">24. RECORDING. Either Lessor or Lessee shall, upon request of the other, execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other a 'short form' memorandum of this Lease for recording purposes.</p>

Lessee does hereby make, constitute and irrevocably appoint Lessor as Lessee=s attorney-in-fact and in Lessee=s name, place and stead, to execute such documents in accordance with this paragraph 30(b).</p>
