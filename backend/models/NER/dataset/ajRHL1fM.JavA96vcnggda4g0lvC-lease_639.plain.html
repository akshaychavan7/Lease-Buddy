          <p id="s1p239">AS AMENDED ON 1 JUNE 2001, 24 APRIL 2002 AND 23 MARCH 2004</p>
          <p id="s1p240">ON NOTICE OF MORTGAGE/CHARGE</p>
          <p id="s1p241">1 These Practice Circulars were sent to the Association of Banks in Singapore, the Finance Houses Association of Singapore, and The Law Society of Singapore.</p>
          <p id="s1p242">2 The Circulars state that with effect from 15 November 1999, all mortgages and charges created or transferred in respect of our properties are governed by the Practice Circular. Under this process, our terms and conditions have been set out upfront to give greater transparency of our policies, and to assist our customers in obtaining funds quickly with minimum administrative inconvenience.</p>
          <p id="s1p243">3 Consequently, notwithstanding the provisions in the Building Agreement/Agreement for Lease/Lease, our current policy is that in respect of all mortgages/charges created or transferred on or after 15 November 1999, we waive our contractual requirement that our prior written consent must be obtained for the creation/transfer of a mortgage/charge, subject to :</p>
          <p id="s1p244">3.1 submission of a duly completed Notice of Mortgage/Charge, in the form set out in Annex A (of the 30 October Circular); and</p>
          <p id="s1p245">3.2 the terms and conditions set out in Annex B (of the 30 October Circular).</p>
          <p id="s1p246">4 The mortgagor/chargor (i.e., licensee/lessee) may authorise their solicitor to duly complete and submit the Notice on their behalf.</p>
          <p id="s1p247">5 Under this process :</p>
          <p id="s1p248">5.1 the Notice need only be sent to us each time a mortgage/charge is to be created or transferred;</p>
          <p id="s1p249">5.2 parties need not inform us of any change in the amount of facilities secured;</p>
          <p id="s1p250">5.3 our administrative fee has been waived;</p>
          <p id="s1p251">5.4 the mortgage/charge documents do not have to be endorsed by us; and</p>
          <p id="s1p252">5.5 copies of the mortgage/charge documents do not have to be sent to us.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">6 The terms and conditions of the Practice Circular which the parties must, in particular, comply with are :</p>
          <p id="s1p254">6.1 submit the Notice to us prior to the creation or transfer of any mortgage/charge;</p>
          <p id="s1p255">6.2 notify us if the mortgage/charge has been discharged or is not proceeded with; and</p>

          <p id="s1p259">8 We reserve the full right and liberty to terminate or change this process at any time in respect of subsequent mortgages and charges.</p>
          <p id="s1p260">9 As we receive a large number of Notices every day, we regret that it is not possible for us to reply and confirm receipt.
