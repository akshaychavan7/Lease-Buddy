          <p id="s1p6">In connection with a lease in effect between Cummings Properties, LLC, LESSOR, and Abpro Corporation, LESSEE, at 65 Cummings Park and 395 West Cummings Park, Woburn, Massachusetts (“premises” or “leased premises”), fully executed on July 2, 2014 and currently scheduled to terminate on August 30, 2017, and in consideration of the mutual benefits to be derived herefrom, the parties hereby agree to amend said lease, including its terms, conditions, covenants, and obligations (“terms”), as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p7">1. The lease is hereby extended for an additional term of four years and one month and is now currently scheduled to terminate at noon on September 30, 2021, unless otherwise terminated or extended as provided in the lease, as amended.</p>
          <p id="s1p8">2. Effective upon the CP Delivery Date (defined below), annual base rent shall be changed to four hundred forty three thousand six hundred seventy six (443,676) dollars per year or $36,973 per month.</p>
          <p id="s1p9">3. Effective upon the CP Delivery Date, the base month from which to determine the amount of each annual increase in the “Cost of Living” shall be November 2016, which figure shall be compared with the figure for November 2017, and each November thereafter to determine the increase (if any) in the base rent to be paid during the following calendar year.</p>
          <p id="s1p10">4. The security deposit is hereby increased by $130,800 from $54,000 to a new total of $184,800. LESSEE shall pay this increase upon LESSEE’s execution of this extension.</p>
          <p id="s1p11">5. Notwithstanding Section 4 above, provided LESSEE is not then in arrears of any rent or invoice payment or otherwise in default of the lease, LESSOR shall apply $36,973 of the security deposit toward payment of the monthly rent due for the month of December 2019.</p>

          <p id="s1p17">11. Effective upon the date LESSEE vacates and surrenders 395 WCP to LESSOR in full accordance with all terms of the lease, Section 9 of Amendment to Lease #1 shall be automatically deleted and of no further force or effect.</p>

          <p id="s1p26">14. During the extended term of the lease set forth in Section 1 above (only), provided LESSEE is not then in arrears of any rent or invoice payment or otherwise in default of the lease, LESSEE shall have the one-time right of first lease of approximately 4,902 square feet of additional space at 64 Cummings Park (subject to LESSOR’s right to subdivide said space) at LESSOR’s then-current published rental rate for said space as it becomes available for lease directly from LESSOR after its next leasing to others, subject to the right of the then-current lessee (if any) to extend or otherwise renegotiate its lease. LESSEE shall have five business days from receipt of (i) notice from LESSOR of said availability and. (ii)LESSOR’s then-current standard form lease of amendment to lease to execute said lease or amendment to lease for said space. If LESSOR fails to notify LESSEE of the availability of said space and leases said space to others, and if LESSEE notifies LESSOR of its desire to lease said space and executes LESSOR’s then-current standard form lease or amendment to lease for said space within five business days of receipt of said then-current standard form lease or amendment to lease for said space, LESSOR shall then have 60 days to relocate the other party. If LESSOR fails to relocate the other party within said 60 days and execute LESSOR’s then-current standard form lease or amendment to lease with LESSEE, then LESSEE may elect, by serving LESSOR written notice within 30 days after expiration of the 60-day relocation period, to occupy a similar amount of additional space elsewhere in one of LESSOR’s buildings at no charge until such time as LESSOR delivers possession of 64 Cummings Park. This shall be LESSEE’s exclusive remedy for any failure by LESSOR to deliver possession of 64 Cummings Park or any breach by LESSOR of the terms of this section. Time is of the essence.</p>
          <p id="s1p27">15. In the event that, on or before 4:00 PM on June 30, 2021 , this lease is not further extended for a minimum term of one year commencing on or about October 1, 2021 for a minimum of 13,974 square feet, LESSSE shall pay to LESSOR $64,276 as a non-renewal fee (by certified check, bank check, cash, or wire transfer) not later than 5:00 PM on June 30, 2021. Time is of the essence.</p>
          <p id="s1p28">This extension shall not bind any party in any manner whatsoever until it has been executed by all parties. All other terms of the lease shall continue to apply, and to the extent any inconsistency exists between this extension and the lease, including any prior amendments and extensions, the terms herein shall control and supersede any earlier provisions. In witness whereof, LESSOR and LESSEE, intending to be legally bound, have caused this extension to be executed this 22nd day of May, 2017.</p>
