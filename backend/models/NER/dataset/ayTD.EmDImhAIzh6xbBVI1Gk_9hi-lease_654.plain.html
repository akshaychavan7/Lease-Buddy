          <p id="s1p197">2. Lender hereby consents to the Lease and all the provisions thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p198">3. Except as permitted by the Lease, Lessee shall not assign the Lease, nor sublet any portion of the Leased Premises, and Lessor shall not consent to any such assignment, or subletting other than as permitted by the terms of the Lease, without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
          <p id="s1p199">4. The Deed of Trust and any amendments, modifications, renewals and extensions thereof shall be and remain at all times a lien and charge on the Leased Premises, prior and superior to the Lease, to the leasehold estate created thereby and to all rights and privileges of Lessee or any other Lessee thereunder, subject to the terms hereof, and the Lease, the leasehold estate created thereby and all rights and privileges of Lessee or any other lessee thereunder are hereby subjected and made subordinate to the lien and charge of the Deed of Trust in favor of Lender, subject to the terms hereof.</p>

          <p id="s1p201">6. Lender in making disbursements pursuant to any agreement with Lessor is under no obligation or duty to, nor has Lender represented that it will, see to the application of the proceeds of the loan by Lessor or any other persons to whom Lender disburse the proceeds of the loan. Any application or use of such proceeds for purposes other than those provided for in any agreement between Lender and Lessor shall not defeat the subordination made in this Agreement, in whole or in part.</p>
          <p id="s1p202">7. Lessee intentionally subjects and subordinates the Lease, the leasehold estate created thereby together with all rights and privileges or Lessee or any other lessee thereunder in favor of the lien and charge upon the Leased Premises of the Deed of Trust, subject to the terms hereof, and understands that in reliance upon and in consideration of this subjection and subordination, specific loans and advances are being and will be made and specific monetary and other obligations are being undertaken and will be entered into which would not be made or entered into but for said reliance upon this subjection and subordination.</p>
          <p id="s1p203">8.

Said attornment is to be effective and self-operative without the execution of any other instruments on the part of either party hereto immediately upon Successor’s succeeding to the interest of the lessor under the Lease; provided, however, that Lessee agrees to provide written confirmation of its attornment within ten (10) days after receipt of a written request for such confirmation by such Successor. In any such event as described above, the Lease shall continue in accordance with its terms between Lessee as tenant and such Successor as Lessor; provided, however, that such Successor shall not be:</p>
          <p id="s1p205">(i) liable for any act or omission of any prior landlord (including Lessor) under the Lease (without limiting any rights of Lessee under the Lease for non-monetary defaults of any prior landlord which continues and which such Successor fails to cure within a reasonable time after such Successor acquires Lessor’s interest under the Lease);</p>
          <p id="s1p206">(ii) subject to any offsets or abatements against rent which Lessee may have against any prior landlord (including Lessor) except for the exercise of rights expressly set forth in the Lease;</p>

          <p id="s1p210">10. Lessor agrees that, except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement does not constitute a waiver by Lender of any of its rights under the Deed of Trust or related documents, and that the Deed of Trust and any related documents remain in full force and effect and shall be complied with in all respects by the Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p211">11. Lessee agrees with Lender that from and after the date hereof, Lessee will not terminate or seek to terminate the Lease by reasons of any act or omission of the lessor thereunder or for any other reason until Lessee shall have given written notice and opportunity to cure (as hereafter provided), by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, of said act or omission to Lender, which notice shall be addressed to:</p>
