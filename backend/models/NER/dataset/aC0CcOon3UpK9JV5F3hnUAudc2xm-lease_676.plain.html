Washington, Suite 201 Portland, OR 97216 Attention: Ms. Keren Brown Wilson, Chief Executive Officer RE: AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AND LEASE ASSISTED LIVING RESIDENCES Dear Ms. Wilson: LTC Properties, Inc. (&quot;LTC&quot;) is pleased to advise you that LTC agrees, either itself or through its subsidiary or affiliate, and subject to the parameters outlined in this letter, to enter into sale/leaseback transactions with Assisted Living Concepts, Inc.

LTC shall be obligated to pay to ALC, or its designee, the Stabilization Period Losses at Closing with respect to each Property if the amount of the Stabilization Period Losses is ascertainable at such time. To the extent that the amount of the Stabilization Period Losses is not ascertainable at the time of LTC's purchase of a Property, LTC shall remain obligated to pay to ALC, or its designee, the Stabilization Period Losses at such time as the amount of the Stabilization Period Losses becomes ascertainable; provided, further, that as a pre-condition to LTC's obligation to disburse any such amount to ALC, or its designee, LTC shall cause to be prepared at ALC's expense, and ALC shall execute, an amendment to its lease (a) increasing the initial annual minimum rental amount thereunder by an amount equal to of the sum of the Stabilization Period Losses multiplied by the then applicable lease rate, and (b) to the extent payment of the Stabilization Period Losses is made to ALC's designee, acknowledging the benefit ALC has received in consideration of such rental increase. 2.

The survey shall also certify that the Property is or is not in a flood hazard area for purposes of the national Flood Insurance Program, and if so, shall specify the flood zone designation assigned to the Property; provided, however, that if ALC's surveyor for any reason cannot or will not provide such flood zone information, ALC shall be entitled to, and shall, provide such information to LTC from another source acceptable to LTC in the reasonable exercise of LTC's discretion .

TERM; CROSS-DEFAULTING. Each lease shall have an initial ----- ----------------- term of twelve (12) years.

As a result, the parties anticipate that the Properties will not all be acquired by LTC at one time, and ALC's obligation to pay Minimum Rent and other charges under each lease will commence concurrently with LTC's acquisition of the Property to which the lease relates. The lease with respect to each Property shall group the Property with three (3) other properties owned (or to be owned) by LTC Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assited Living Concepts, Inc. October 3, 1997 Page 5 and leased (or to be leased) to ALC, its subsidiary or affiliate, each such group of four (4) or more Properties hereinafter being referred to as a &quot;Package,&quot; and all of the Properties to be included in a Package shall be identified to LTC by not later than the date of the closing of the first Property in the Package to be acquired by LTC; provided, however, that if ALC has not identified the Properties in each Package to LTC by such time, LTC shall have the right, but not the obligation, then or at any time thereafter, to determine which Properties shall be included within the Package selecting only from Properties set forth on Exhibit &quot;A&quot; hereof. ALC shall have two consecutive five-year options to extend the term of all of the leases within each Package; that is, ALC shall only have the option - --- to extend the term of any of the leases in a Package so long as ALC exercises its option to extend the term of all of the leases in a Package. In addition, the leases for all of the Properties in each Package shall be co-terminus with all of the other leases in that Package, but will not be co-terminus with the leases in the other Packages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the leases for each of the Properties shall be cross-defaulted with (i) each lease for each of the other Properties (irrespective of which Package the Properties are in), and (ii) every other lease between LTC and ALC (including without limitation any leases between LTC, on the one hand, and Home and Community Care, Inc. and/or Carriage House Assisted Living, Inc., on the other hand, if and when either of said entities (or the assets thereof) is acquired by ALC) with respect to any Facility, except for those five (5) leases relating to those certain five (5) assisted living properties in the State of Washington commonly known as: Chenoweth House, Kennewick, WA; Pioneer House, Walla Walla, WA; Orchard House, Grandview, WA; Lexington House, Vancouver, WA: and Mountain View House, Camas, WA. In addition to the foregoing, if a default is declared and not cured within thirty (30) days on any of ALC's major (that is, $5,000,000 or more) loans or lines of credit, or if such loan or line of credit is accelerated or the lender thereunder takes any action to enforce the same, then LTC shall have the right, but not the obligation, also to declare a default under each of the leases entered into hereunder. 4. MINIMUM RENT. The initial annual Minimum Rent for the first ------------ year of each lease shall be an amount equal to the sum of the Specific Property Purchase Price and the Stabilization Period Losses (to the extent then ascertainable) paid by LTC (or its designee) for each Property multiplied by nine and ninety-five hundredths percent (9.95%).

Commencing on the first anniversary of the rent commencement date for each lease (the &quot;Anniversary Date&quot;), and continuing thereafter on each subsequent Anniversary Date during the initial term and each option term of each lease, the Minimum Rent applicable to each lease shall be increased in accordance with the terms and provisions attached hereto as Exhibit &quot;B.&quot; Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assited Living Concepts, Inc. October 3, 1997 Page 6 5. RENT DURING OPTION PERIODS. The initial Minimum Rent for the first -------------------------- of the option terms for each lease shall be the higher of: (i) the previous year's Minimum Rent amount increased in accordance with the terms and provisions attached hereto as Exhibit &quot;B&quot;; or (ii) an amount equal to the initial Minimum Rent payable in the first twelve (12) months of the initial term of the lease adjusted by the cumulative increase in the Consumer Price Index, U.S. Cities Average, All Items (1982-84=100) published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics in accordance with the manner presently calculated (the &quot;CPI&quot;) from the commencement date of the applicable lease to the date on which the new Minimum Rent is being determined.
