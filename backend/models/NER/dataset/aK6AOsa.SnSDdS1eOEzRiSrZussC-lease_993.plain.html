          <p id="s1p99">Sec. 1. Rentals- Rentals shall be paid to the proper office of lessor in advance of each lease year until there is production in commercial quantities from the leased lands. Annual rental rates per acre or fraction thereof are: $1 for noncompetitive leases and $2 for competitive leases.</p>
          <p id="s1p100">If this lease or a portion thereof is committed to an approved cooperative or unit plan which includes a well capable of producing leased resources, and the plan contains a provision for allocation of production, royalties shall be paid on the production allocated to this lease. However, annual rentals shall continue to be due for those lands not within a participating area.</p>
          <p id="s1p101">Failure to pay annual rental, if due, on or before the anniversary date of this lease (or next official working day if office is closed) shall automatically terminate this lease by operation of law. Rentals may be suspended by the Secretary upon a sufficient showing by lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">Sec. 2. Royalties- Royalties shall be paid to proper office of lessor. Royalties shall be computed in accordance with regulations and orders. Royalty rates on production are: 10 percent for steam, heat, or energy; 5 percent for byproducts; and 5 percent for demineralized water</p>

          <p id="s1p104">A minimum royalty shall be due for any lease year beginning on or after the commencement of production in commercial quantities in which royalty payments aggregate less than $2 per acre. Lessee shall pay such difference at the end of lease year. This minimum royalty may be waived, suspended, or reduced, and the above royalty rates may be reduced for all or portions of this lease if the Secretary determines that such action is necessary to encourage the greatest ultimate recovery of the leased resources, or is otherwise justified.</p>
          <p id="s1p105">Sec. 3. Bonds- Lease shall file and maintain any bond required under regulations.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">Sec. 4.

BLM may recommend modifications to exploration and development proposals to further its conservation and management objective to avoid BLM-approved activity that will contribute to a need to list such a species or their habitat. BLM may require modifications to or disapprove proposed activity that is likely to result in jeopardy to the continued existence of a proposed or listed threatened or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modifications of a designated or proposed critical habitat. BLM will not approve any ground-disturbing activity that may affect any such species or critical habitat until it completes its obligations under applicable requirements of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1531, as amended, including completion of any required procedure for conference or consultation.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">Wild Horse and Burros.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">Controlled or Limited Surface Use: (avoidance and/or mitigation measures to be developed.) If wild horse or burro populations are located on sites proposed for development, it may be necessary to avoid or develop mitigation measures to reduce adverse impacts to horses. These measures may include providing alternative water sources for horses of equal quality and quantity,</p>
          <p id="s1p135">Surface disturbing activities during the migratory bird nesting season (March to July) may be restricted in order to avoid potential violation of the Migratory Bird Act. Appropriate inventories of migratory birds shall be conducted during analysis of actual site development. If active nests are located, the proponent shall coordinate with BLM to establish appropriate protection measures for the nesting sites which may include avoidance or restricting or excluding development during certain areas to times when nests and nesting birds will not be disturbed. During development and production phases, if artificial ponds potentially detrimental to migratory birds are created, these shall be fitted with exclusion devices such as netting or floating balls.Migratory Birds:</p>

The details of the monitoring programs will be site specific and the intensity shall be commensurate with the level of exploration. For example, if the proponent will be conducting seismic studies the monitoring would be limited to the identification of water resources to be monitored as activities continue; if a drilling program were to be undertaken the number of aquifers encountered, their properties, their quality, and their saturated thickness would be documented. The information collected will be submitted to the Bureau of Land Management and will be used to support future NEPA documentation as development progresses. Adverse impacts to surface expressions of the geothermal reservoir (hot springs), and Threatened and Endangered Species habitat are not acceptable. The lessee will monitor the quality, quantity, and temperature of any hot springs or oth er water resource within the project area whenever they are conducting activities which have the potential to impact those resources. If adverse impacts do occur, BLM will require the lessee to take corrective action to mitigate the impact. Corrective action may include shutting down the operation. These are in addition to the other stipulations. These are LEASE stipulations, not operational, the information gathered under the monitoring stipulation will be used to identify future impacts at the operational stage.</p>
