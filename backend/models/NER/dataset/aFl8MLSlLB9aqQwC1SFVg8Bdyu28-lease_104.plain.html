          <p id="s1p83">8</p>
          <p id="s1p84">provision of this Agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period after notice regarding such breach or (iv) Purchaser or Constar experiences a change of Control such that Purchaser or Constar is controlled by a competitor of either Constar or Crown.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">(b) The following shall be considered events of default and shall give rise to a right of Purchaser to terminate this Agreement within 45 days of Purchaser’s discovery of such event of default: (i) Supplier or Crown suffers a Bankruptcy Event, (ii) Supplier materially breaches any other applicable provision of this Agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period after notice regarding such breach or (iii) Supplier or Crown experiences a change of Control such that Supplier or Crown is controlled by a competitor of either Constar or Crown.</p>

          <p id="s1p87">5.3. No Waiver. If the party not in default continues to make or accept shipments, as the case may be, despite the other party’s default, such action shall not constitute a waiver of the default, or in any way affect the rights under this Agreement of the party not in default. A waiver by either party of any breach of any provision shall not constitute a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any other provision.</p>
          <p id="s1p88">5.4. Force Majeure. Neither Supplier nor Purchaser shall be responsible for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond their respective control, including, without limitation, earthquake, fire, storm, flood, freeze, labor disputes, transportation embargoes, acts of God or of any government and acts of war or terrorism (any of the foregoing, a “Force Majeure Event”). Any party, if affected by any such cause, may, upon written notice to the other specifying the reasons therefor, reduce its obligations to the other by an amount not in excess of the quantity that it is unable to deliver or purchase due to such cause. In the event such a curtailment by either party continues in whole or in part for a period of 5 continuous days, then, in the case of a Supplier Force Majeure Event, Purchaser may arrange for temporary supply of its requirements until Supplier can resume delivery of PET Products to Purchaser, and, in the case of a Purchaser Force Majeure Event, Purchaser shall use its best efforts to sell to third parties those PET Products which would have been delivered to a Constar Customer on Purchaser’s behalf (in accordance with Purchaser’s delivery schedule) in the absence of such curtailment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this provision shall not apply to or otherwise excuse the failure to pay any uncontested costs or fees due under this Agreement when due (including payment for PET Products produced in accordance with Section 2.1, regardless of whether Purchaser submits a Release Request for such PET Preforms).</p>

          <p id="s1p100">5.6.3. Ownership of Information.

          <p id="s1p132">6.4.5. Resolution of disputes under the procedures of this Section 6.4 shall be the sole and exclusive means of resolving disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the Parties from seeking in any court of competent jurisdiction temporary or interim injunctive relief to the extent necessary to preserve the subject matter of the dispute pending resolution under this Section 6.4.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">6.5. Consent to Jurisdiction.

          <p id="s1p136">6.8. Severability.

          <p id="s1p137">14</p>
          <p id="s1p138">in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject, it shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be valid and enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law or the determination by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
