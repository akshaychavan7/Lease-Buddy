Neither party shall be liable to the other for the amount of such loss or damage which is in excess of the applicable deductible, if any, caused by fire or any of the risks enumerated in such policy, provided such waiver was obtainable at the time of such loss or damage. However, if such waiver cannot be obtained, or is obtainable only by the payment of an additional premium charge above that charged by companies carrying such insurance without such waiver of subrogation, the party undertaking to obtain such waiver shall notify the other party of such fact and such other party shall have a period of twenty (20) days after the giving of such notice to agree in writing to pay such additional premium if such policy is obtainable at additional cost; and if such other party does not so agree duly in writing to pay such additional premium, or the waiver is unobtainable, this Section shall be null and void as to the risks covered by such policy for so long as either such waiver cannot be obtained or the party in whose favor a waiver of subrogation is desired shall refuse to pay the additional premium charge. If the release of either Landlord or Tenant, as set forth in the second sentence of this Section, shall contravene any law with respect to exculpatory agreements, the liability of the party in question shall be deemed not released but no action or rights shall be sought or enforced against such party unless and until all rights and remedies against the other's insurer are exhausted and the other party shall be unable to collect such insurance proceeds.</p>

In the event that a subsequent amendment of the Rules becomes effective, the time frames set forth herein shall pertain, as applicable, to the substantive equivalent of those rules contained in such later version.</p>

(a) If this Lease is assigned or if the Demised Premises is sublet or occupied by anyone other than Tenant, Landlord, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and Tenant's failure to cure following applicable notice, may collect Fixed Rent, additional rent and other charges from the assignee, sublessee or occupant, and apply the net amount collected to the Fixed Rent, additional rent and other charges herein provided, but unless Landlord in its sole discretion otherwise elects, no such assignment, subletting, occupancy or collection shall be deemed a waiver of any covenant by Tenant under this Article 10, nor shall the same be deemed the acceptance of the assignee, sublessee or occupant as a tenant, or a release of Tenant from the further performance of the covenants and agreements on the part of Tenant to be performed herein contained.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">(b) If Landlord shall for any reason or cause recover or come into possession of the Demised Premises before the Expiration Date, Landlord shall have the right at its option to take over any and all subleases or sublettings of the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof made or granted by Tenant and to succeed to all the rights and privileges of said subleases and sublettings or such of them as it may elect to take over and assume; and Tenant hereby expressly assigns and transfers to Landlord such of the subleases and sublettings as Landlord may elect to take over and assume at the time of such recovery of possession, and Tenant shall upon request of Landlord execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord such further assignments and transfers as may be necessary, sufficient and proper to vest in Landlord the then existing subleases and subletting.</p>

(a) Each permitted assignee or transferee shall assume and be deemed to have assumed this Lease and shall be and remain liable jointly and severally with Tenant for the payment of the Fixed Rent, additional rent, other charges and adjustments of rent, and, subject to the right to change the Authorized Use pursuant to Section 10.02(b), for the due performance of and compliance with all the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions and agreements herein contained on Tenant's part to be performed or complied with for the Term.</p>

Within five (5) business days after Landlord receives Tenant's notice that it is exercising the Renewal Option (&quot;Renewal Notice&quot;), Landlord shall notify Tenant of Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rent. Within five (5) business days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's determination, Tenant shall notify Landlord whether Tenant accepts or rejects said determination. In the event Tenant fails to notify Landlord within the foregoing five (5) business day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have accepted Landlord's determination. If Tenant gives Landlord timely notice of its objection to Landlord's determination, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that the arbitration process hereinafter set forth shall determine the Fair Market Rent. Each party, at their own expense, shall then designate a real estate broker with not less than fifteen (15) years experience in commercial leasing transactions in the area in which the Demised Premises is located who shall determine and promptly report (and in no event later than the twentieth (20th) day following Landlord's receipt of the Renewal Notice) to both parties in writing the Fair Market Rent of the Demised Premises. If the reports indicate proposed rental amounts that are within five (5%) percent of each other, Landlord and Tenant agree that the Fair Market Rent shall be an average of such amounts. However, if after receiving the reports, the parties are unable to agree on the Fair Market Rent (and the amounts are not within five (5%) percent of each other) within five (5) days, both parties shall jointly appoint a separate broker (meeting the aforesaid criteria) who shall determine the Fair Market Rent by selecting either Landlord's Fair Market Rent determination or Tenant's Fair Market Rent determination according to whichever of the two valuations as set forth in the reports from Landlord's broker or Tenant's broker, respectively, is closer to the actual Fair Market Rent in the opinion of such third broker. The third broker shall have no discretion other than to select one or the other report as aforesaid. The costs of such third broker shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant. The parties must work together and coordinate efforts to obtain such third broker's report in writing no later than the thirty-fifth (35th) day following the date of Landlord's receipt of the Renewal Notice. Pending such determination and in the event the term for the Renewal Period commences prior to the final determination of the Fair Market Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Fair Market Rent as fixed by Landlord, subject to adjustment (with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum) upon resolution of such dispute.</p>
          <p id="s1p356">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Tenant have respectively signed and sealed this Lease as of the day and year first above written.</p>
