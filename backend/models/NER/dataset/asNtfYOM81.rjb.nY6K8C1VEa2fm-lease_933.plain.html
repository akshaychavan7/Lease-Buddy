          <p id="s1p292">THIS NET LEASE (this “Lease”), is made this 30th day of September, 1998 by and between OPUS NORTHWEST, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, (the “Landlord”) and COMPUTER NETWORK TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a Minnesota corporation, (the “Tenant”).</p>
          <p id="s1p293">WITNESSETH:</p>
          <p id="s1p294">Landlord, for and in consideration of the rents, covenants and agreements stated herein on the part of Tenant, its successors and assigns, to be paid, kept, observed and performed, has leased, rented, let and demised, and by these presents does lease, rent, let and demise unto Tenant, and Tenant does hereby take and hire, upon and subject to the parties’ obligations hereunder, all that parcel of land situated in the City of Plymouth, County of Hennepin and State of Minnesota, described in Exhibit “A” attached hereto and made a part hereof, together with any appurtenant easements described in said Exhibit “A” (the “Land”), together with all improvements located on and to be constructed thereon. The “Landlord’s Improvements” and the “Tenant’s Improvements” (as those terms are defined in Article II) and all other improvements, machinery, equipment, fixtures and other property, real, personal or mixed (except Tenant’s trade fixtures) installed or located thereon by Landlord, together with all additions, alterations and replacements thereof are hereinafter referred to as the “Improvements.” The Land and the Improvements are hereinafter referred to as the “Demised Premises.” The Demised Premises are subject to the easements, restrictions, reservations and all other encumbrances now or hereafter recorded against the Land all as set forth on Exhibit “E” (the “Permitted Encumbrances”). The structures to be located upon and being a part of the Demised Premises which are constructed for human occupancy or for storage of goods, merchandise, equipment, or other personal property are collectively called the “Building.”</p>

          <p id="s1p297">Section 1.1 Term of Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p298">Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, the initial term of this Lease (the “Initial Term”) shall be for one hundred twenty six (126) full calendar months (plus the beginning partial month, if any) commencing on the Commencement Date (as defined in Section 2.4 hereof), and ending on the last day of the one hundred and twenty sixth (126th) full calendar month after the Commencement Date (the</p>

          <p id="s1p300">“Termination Date”). The “Term” of this Lease shall mean the Initial Term, together with any “Renewal Terms” (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof) of this Lease or any extensions to or modifications of the Initial Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p301">Section 1.2 Option to Renew.</p>
          <p id="s1p302">Tenant shall have the right, to be exercised as hereinafter provided, to extend the Term of this Lease for two (2) extension periods (hereinafter, collectively referred to as “Renewal Terms”, or individually as “Renewal Term”) of five (5) years each, upon the terms and conditions and subject to the limitations set forth in Article XXII herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p303">ARTICLE II</p>
          <p id="s1p304">CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS</p>
          <p id="s1p305">Section 2.1 Landlord’s Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p306">Landlord agrees to furnish at Landlord’s sole cost and expense all of the material, labor, and equipment for the construction on the Land of the improvements specified on the “Outline Plans and Specifications” which are listed in Exhibit “B” attached hereto and made a part hereof (the “Landlord’s Improvements”). Landlord’s Improvements shall be constructed in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with the “Final Plans and Specifications”, as the same are proposed by Landlord and approved by Tenant in substantial accordance with this Lease and Landlord agrees to complete the construction thereof in accordance with all applicable building codes as presently interpreted and enforced by the governmental bodies having jurisdiction thereof; provided, however, that reference is made to Article IX for specific provisions dealing with “ADA” and “Hazardous Materials Laws.” Landlord will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a project “no-strike” provision from the building trades council for the construction of the Improvements. Upon “Substantial Completion” (as hereinafter defined), the Improvements will be fit for human occupancy and use.</p>
          <p id="s1p307">Landlord agrees to prepare the Final Plans and Specifications so that they are consistent with the Outline Plans and Specifications. Upon completion of each phase of the Final Plans and Specifications, Landlord will submit the same to Tenant for its approval. Tenant agrees that it will approve each such phase provided that each such phase is consistent with the Outline Plans and Specifications. Tenant shall approve or disapprove each phase of the Final Plans and Specifications within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of same, and if Tenant fails to approve or disapprove same within such ten (10) calendar day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved such phase of the Final Plans and Specifications. The Final Plans and Specifications shall be approved by Landlord and Tenant by affixing thereon the signature or initials of (in the</p>
          <p id="s1p308">3</p>
          <p id="s1p309">case of the Landlord) an authorized officer or employee (and in the case of the Tenant) an authorized officer of each of the respective parties hereto and a complete description thereof (in the form of a schedule of drawings) shall be attached to each parties’ copy of this Lease and made a part hereof as Exhibit “C”. Such Exhibit “C” shall control the parties’ obligations hereunder, except as to nonconstruction matters contained in Exhibit “B”, such as allowances and exclusions not expressly and specifically superseded by Exhibit “C”. The signature of such authorized officer or employee shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the approval indicated by such signature. Landlord agrees to appoint competent personnel to work with Tenant in the preparation of the Final Plans and Specifications for the Building and Tenant agrees to appoint an officer or employee of Tenant to work with Landlord in the preparation of the Final Plans and Specifications for the Building. Landlord and Tenant have initially designated the individuals identified on Exhibit “C-1” as their respective representative, although both parties reserve the right to change such designation at will. Landlord acknowledges that Tenant has retained the services of David Jackson as a construction consultant, (the “Consultant”); however, the Consultant has not been given authority by the Tenant to make decisions on behalf of the Tenant. Accordingly, while Landlord will allow the Consultant access to the Demised Premises, Landlord will look directly to Tenant (and not the Consultant) for the performance of all of Tenant’s obligations hereunder. Landlord shall have the authority to make changes required by any applicable laws, codes, ordinances or regulations, as well as minor changes in the work to be performed by it under this Lease and not inconsistent with the applicable Outline Plans and Specifications or Final Plans and Specifications, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p310">When Landlord requests Tenant to specify details or layouts with respect to the Improvements, Tenant shall specify same, subject to the provisions of the Outline Plans and Specifications, so as not to delay completion of the Landlord’s Improvements and, in any event, within five (5) business days of request by Landlord. Tenant shall pay to Landlord all increased out-of-pocket costs or actual damages incurred by Landlord attributable to Tenant’s delays in performing its obligations under this Article II. In the event that such delays caused by Tenant result in the “Commencement Date” (as defined in Section 2.4) being delayed, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Commencement Date shall be deemed to occur on the date on which the Commencement Date would have occurred but for such delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p311">Tenant and Landlord acknowledge that it is expected that all governmental approvals and permits which Landlord believes are required in order for Landlord to “Substantially Complete” (as defined in Section 2.5) the Landlord Improvements and which are necessary to permit “Assembly” (as defined in Section 4.1) in at least 38,000 square feet of the Building (the “Permits”) will be issued by the appropriate governmental authorities by October 25, 1998. If any of the Permits are not, despite Landlord’s diligent pursuit thereof, received by Landlord by October 25, 1998, the “Target Commencement Date” (as hereinafter defined) shall be automatically extended day-for-day for each day after such date until the day that the Permits are issued. Such</p>
          <p id="s1p312">4</p>
          <p id="s1p313">delay in obtaining the Permits shall constitute “Excused Delay” (as hereinafter defined). The Landlord expects to receive the following “Preliminary Approvals” for the construction of the Improvements from the City of Plymouth on October 7, 1998: Site Plan approval, a Conditional Use Permit to exceed the height restrictions of the City and to permit limited Assembly on the Demised Premises and a Fire Lane Variance. In the event that, as of the conclusion of the City Council meeting on October 7, 1998, the Preliminary Approvals have not been obtained, then either party hereto may terminate this Lease on October 8, 1998 by delivering notice of such termination to the other party on or before 5:00 p.m. on October 8, 1998. In any event, the termination right herein provided for shall, if not exercised as aforesaid, be deemed to be null and void and of no further force and effect as of 5:00 p.m. on October 8, 1998.</p>
          <p id="s1p314">Section 2.2 Tenant Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p315">Landlord will furnish all of the material, labor and equipment for the construction on the Demised Premises of the “Tenant Improvements” {as defined in Section 2.2(a)}. The Tenant Improvements shall be constructed in a good a workmanlike manner in substantial accordance with the “Final Tenant Improvement Plans” {as defined in Section 2.2(c)}.</p>
          <p id="s1p316">(a) Landlord shall provide Tenant with a “Tenant Improvement Allowance” in the amount of $4,573,125.00 for payment of the “Tenant Improvement Costs” {as defined in Section 2.2(d)} incurred in constructing the “Tenant Improvements” {as defined in this Section 2.2(a)}. The Tenant Improvement Allowance may not be used to pay for Tenant’s furniture, fixtures or equipment (other than weight room equipment which is attached to the Improvements) and/or any Tenant Improvements not approved by Landlord. The Tenant Improvement Allowance may also be used to pay for the Proposed Kitchen Equipment identified on Exhibit “I” or equipment performing the same function as the items on Exhibit I. The “Tenant Improvements” are those Improvements identified in the “Final Tenant Improvement Plans” (as hereinafter defined). The Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be used by Landlord to pay for the Tenant Improvement Costs. In the event the Tenant Improvement Costs exceed the Tenant Improvement Allowance (the “Excess”), Landlord may require that Tenant provide Landlord with reasonable cash security (as determined by Landlord in its sole discretion) to cover the amount of such Excess. Tenant shall, in any event, pay the Excess to Landlord on or before the Commencement Date. In the event the Tenant Improvement Cost is less than the Tenant Improvement Allowance, then Tenant shall be entitled to a Basic Rent adjustment as provided in Section 3.2 herein. Landlord shall be the general contractor for all Tenant Improvement work. Except with respect to mechanical and electrical work (which shall be provided by the same contractors performing the Landlord’s Improvements) and the carpentry and drywall work (which will be performed by Landlord), all other major subcontractors will be competitively bid by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p317">5</p>
          <p id="s1p318">(b) Attached hereto as Exhibit “D” is a schedule of the drawings constituting the preliminary fit plan for the Tenant Improvements to be constructed by Landlord (the “Preliminary Fit Plan”)which Preliminary Fit Plan has been prepared by WCL Interiors, Inc., (the “T.I. Architect”). The Preliminary Fit Plan has been approved by Tenant. The Tenant shall cause the T.I. Architect to prepare a “Final Fit Plan” for the Tenant Improvements and shall deliver the same to the Landlord for approval on or before October 5, 1998. The Final Fit Plan will be approved by the Landlord within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of same so long as it is substantially similar to the Preliminary Fit Plan.</p>
          <p id="s1p319">(c) After Landlord’s approval of the Final Fit Plan, the Tenant shall cause the T.I. Architect to prepare final plans for the Tenant Improvements in accordance with the Final Fit Plan and shall submit the same to Landlord for approval on or before January 4, 1999. Landlord shall approve or disapprove the final plans for the Tenant Improvements within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of same, and if Landlord fails to approve or disapprove same within such fifteen (15) business day period, Landlord shall be deemed to have approved such final plans. The final plans for the Tenant Improvements which have’ been prepared by the T.I. Architect and approved (or deemed approved) by Landlord are hereinafter referred to as the “Final Tenant Improvement Plans”. Landlord will approve the Final Tenant Improvement Plans if they are substantially similar to the Final Fit Plan, but Landlord will have no obligation to approve such final Tenant Improvement Plans to the extent they are materially inconsistent with the Final Fit Plan. Landlord’s approval of the Final Tenant Improvement Plans will not constitute a representation, warranty or agreement that such plans conform to applicable building codes or professional design standards, Tenant having agreed to look exclusively to the T.I. Architect for such assurances. In the event, however, that Landlord has actual knowledge of a material inconsistency between the Final Tenant Improvement Plans and the requirements of applicable building codes, Landlord will advise Tenant of that inconsistency.</p>
          <p id="s1p320">(d) The price to be charged by Landlord to Tenant for the Tenant Improvements (the “Tenant Improvement Costs”) shall be the sum of the following items: (i) the “Cost of the Work” (as hereinafter defined); plus (ii) Landlord’s actual “General Conditions” (as hereinafter defined) (not to exceed seven percent (7%) of the Cost of the Work); plus (iii) three percent (3%) of the amount referred to in subsection (i) for Landlord’s overhead and profit in connection therewith; plus (iv) any and all sales, transaction privilege and other taxes on any of the foregoing which are not otherwise included on Schedule B-1. The “Cost of the Work” shall mean all costs incurred by the Landlord in the acquisition, construction or installation of the Tenant Improvements in the categories identified on Exhibit “B-1”. “General Conditions” shall include, without limitation, the following costs associated with the Tenant Improvements: project management costs (to the extent not otherwise included on Exhibit B-1), superintendent, permits, plan and specification reproduction, job phone and pager, storage, trash hauling and dumping, general cleanup, first aid safety, small tools and expendable, final clean-up, insurance, field coordinator, site services and miscellaneous equipment. The Tenant Improvements will be constructed on an open</p>
          <p id="s1p321">6</p>
          <p id="s1p322">book basis. Tenant will be permitted to review and audit, at its expense, the Landlord’s records with respect to the Tenant Improvement Costs. Those records will include documents similar to the AIA Application and Certificate for Payment which will allocate the Tenant Improvement Costs to the line items identified on that Application. Such audit must be completed, if at all, within one hundred and fifty (150) days of Substantial Completion. If Landlord agrees with the result of that audit, the Tenant Improvement Cost charged to Tenant shall be the Tenant Improvement Cost so determined pursuant to that audit. If Landlord disagrees with such audit results, the parties will resolve such disagreement pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof and, pending resolution of such arbitration, the Tenant Improvement Cost charged to Tenant will be the amount originally proposed by Landlord. Upon completion of such arbitration, the Tenant Improvement Cost finally charged to Tenant will be the amount determined by reason of such arbitration, with appropriate refunds or additional payments to be made within fifteen (15) business days of the completion of the audit. Tenant shall be responsible for Landlord’s costs arising out of delays in completing the Tenant Improvements caused by Tenant making revisions to the Final Tenant Improvement Plans once they have been approved by the Landlord or arising out of any other delay of Tenant in the performance of its obligations under Article II. In the event Tenant orders any long lead time items that would delay Substantial Completion of the Tenant Improvements, such delay shall be deemed a delay by Tenant. “Long lead time items” shall mean items required to complete the Tenant Improvements that may delay Substantial Completion due to causes such as an extended length of time necessary for the supplier to manufacture same or due to a lengthy shipping time. Landlord will advise Tenant if Landlord believes Tenant has ordered long lead time items.</p>
          <p id="s1p323">If Tenant desires to make revisions to the Final Tenant Improvement Plans after Tenant approves the Final Tenant Improvement Plans, Tenant will notify Landlord of such proposed revisions. If Landlord approves the revisions, Tenant will cause the T.I. Architect to revise the Final Tenant Improvement Plans accordingly and will deliver the same to Landlord. Landlord will notify Tenant of the resulting cost increase (or decrease) of Tenant’s Improvements and the anticipated delay in completing the Tenant’s Improvements caused by such revisions, if any. Tenant will approve or disapprove the increased cost and delay within ten (10) business days after Landlord notifies Tenant of the additional cost and delay. If Tenant fails to notify Landlord of its approval or disapproval of the additional cost and delay within the ten (10) business day period, Tenant will be deemed to have disapproved the additional cost or delay. If Tenant disapproves, in writing, the additional cost or delay, Tenant will be deemed to have withdrawn its proposed revisions to the Final Tenant Improvement Plans. If the Tenant approves the additional cost and delay, then the Final Tenant Improvement Plans (and the defined term “Tenant Improvements”) will be deemed amended to include the requested changes, and the Target Commencement Date will be deemed adjusted by the delay occasioned by such revisions.</p>
          <p id="s1p324">7</p>
          <p id="s1p325">Section 2.3 Excused Delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p326">Any delay which is caused or contributed to by act or failure to act of Tenant or those acting for or under Tenant (including, without limitation, delays in approval of plans and specifications or other material selections beyond the time periods required hereby, delays in submission of the Final Fit Plan or the Final Tenant Improvement Plans and delays occasioned by change orders requested and approved by Tenant), labor disputes, casualties, acts of God or the public enemy, governmental embargo restrictions, shortages of fuel, labor, or building materials, action or non-action of public utilities, or of local, state or federal governments affecting the work, or other causes beyond Landlord’s reasonable control, shall constitute “Excused Delay”. Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Tenant of an event of Excused Delay within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of such an event.</p>
          <p id="s1p327">Section 2.4 Possession of Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p328">Except as herein provided (e.g. in cases of events of Excused Delay caused by Tenant, its contractors, agents or employees), Tenant shall not be liable to Landlord for the payment of Basic Rent or the payment of any other obligation to be paid by Tenant under this Lease nor shall Tenant have any right to possession or use of the Demised Premises until the date upon which the Landlord’s Improvements and the Tenant Improvements are “Substantially Completed” (as such phrase is defined in Section 2.5 hereof). The date of Substantial Completion shall be the “Commencement Date”. If Tenant occupies any portion of the Demised Premises prior to Substantial Completion, the terms of this Lease shall apply to such occupancy or use of the Demised Premises by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p329">Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1B with respect to Rental Abatement, Basic Rent and the payment of other obligations to be paid by Tenant shall commence on the date which is sixty one (61) days after the Commencement Date. The failure of Tenant to take possession of or to occupy the Demised Premises after the Commencement Date shall not serve to relieve Tenant of said obligations or delay payments by Tenant to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p330">Subject to this Section 2.4, Tenant, its consultants (including the Consultant) may have access to the Demised Premises ( “Early Access”) for the first sixty-one (61) days following the Commencement Date (the “Early Occupancy Period”) solely for the purpose of installing and testing its machinery, equipment, fixtures and other personal property thereon (the “FF &amp; E”) and not for the purpose of conducting its business therefrom or for any other purpose. However, as a condition precedent to such right of access, Tenant shall first meet with Landlord in order to establish reasonable arrangements for the coordination between Landlord’s work pursuant to this Lease and Tenant’s installation and testing work as aforesaid. Tenant shall contact Landlord to arrange such a meeting, and Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant in</p>
          <p id="s1p331">8</p>
          <p id="s1p332">regard thereto. Following such meeting and the establishment of such coordination of work arrangements, Tenant shall have the aforesaid access, and Landlord and Tenant shall cooperate with one another to permit such access. In connection with any such access and installations by Tenant, Tenant shall not interfere with the completion of construction or occasion any labor dispute as a result of such installations. Tenant hereby agrees to assume all risk of loss or damage to such FF &amp; E, and to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord from any loss or damage to such FF &amp; E, and all liability, loss or damage arising from any injury to the property of Landlord, or its contractors, subcontractors or materialmen, and any death or personal injury to any person or persons to the extent proximately caused by such access or installations, except for liability, loss or damage proximately caused by Landlord’s gross negligence or intentional acts. Further, if Tenant fails to request or delays a request for the required coordination meeting, neither the Commencement Date nor Tenant’s obligations to pay Rent hereunder, shall be delayed.</p>
          <p id="s1p333">Anything in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding other than Section 2.11, Landlord shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, special or consequential damages resulting from any delay in Substantial Completion.</p>

          <p id="s1p385">Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge that Tenant is to receive (a) the benefit of the Tenant Improvement Allowance and (b) a “Moving Allowance” (the “Moving Allowance”) not to exceed $914,625.00 for actual, reasonable costs directly related to the following: (i) Tenant’s physical move from its existing facilities to the Demised Premises; (ii) telephone and computer cabling and connections in the Demised Premises; and (iii) consulting fees, architectural, design and engineering fees relating to the Demised Premises. The aforementioned costs shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Moving Costs”. Provided that there is no uncured Event of Default hereunder, the Moving Allowance shall be paid to Tenant within fifteen (15) days after the later of: (i) the Commencement Date, and (ii) Landlord’s receipt of full and final waivers of</p>

In connection therewith, Tenant shall submit to Landlord a detailed breakdown of all of the costs for which Tenant is seeking reimbursement, together with such evidence of payment as is reasonably satisfactory to Landlord. If the Moving Costs exceed the Moving Allowance, Tenant shall have sole responsibility for the payment of such excess amount. If the Moving Costs are less than the Moving Allowance, Tenant shall not be entitled to any payment, credit or abatement of Basic Rent for such difference. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Tenant shall forfeit its right to payment of any portion of the Moving Allowance which has not been requested by Tenant (with appropriate documentation, as specified above) on or before the 150th day following the Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p388">In the event Tenant does not utilize the entire Tenant Improvement Allowance to pay for the Tenant Improvements, then the annual Basic Rent for each full year of the Initial Term hereof shall be reduced by the product of 0.105 multiplied by the lesser of : (i) the unused portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance or (ii) the sum of $548,775.00. The foregoing reduction to annual Basic Rent shall be prorated for any partial year based upon the ratio that the number of days in such partial year bears to 365. Once the parties have ascertained the foregoing reduction to Basic Rent, if any, Landlord shall prepare and the parties shall execute an amendment to this Lease memorializing the reduction to Basic Rent, as aforesaid. If the unused portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance exceeds $548,775.00, then such excess unused amount (not to exceed $365,850.00) (the “Excess Amount”) shall be available to Tenant for use in making future alterations and improvements to the Demised Premises as set forth herein. The Excess Amount shall be made available to Tenant from time to time for the purposes of making future alterations and improvements to the Demised Premises for a period of twenty (20) months following the Commencement Date. Any portion of the Excess Amount which has not been utilized by Tenant as set forth herein by the expiration of twenty (20) months following the Commencement Date shall be deemed forfeited by Tenant and shall no longer be available to Tenant. The Excess Amount shall only be made available to Tenant for reimbursement for the Tenant’s actual, reasonable expenditures for architectural costs and expenses associated with alterations and improvements, and for the actual, reasonable expenditures for attached and permanent leasehold improvements within the Demised Premises. The Excess Amount shall not be available for payment of any costs not enumerated in the preceding sentence or for the cost of any fixtures, equipment, inventory or personal property.</p>
          <p id="s1p389">Tenant may make up to four (4) requests (but no more frequently than one request per calendar quarter) for payment of all or any portion of the Excess Amount provided Tenant must furnish Landlord with full and final waivers of liens and contractors’ affidavits or statements, in such form as may be required by Landlord,</p>
          <p id="s1p390">15</p>
          <p id="s1p391">showing that all of the said parties have been compensated in full and waiving all liens in connection with the Demised Premises. Tenant shall submit to Landlord a detailed breakdown of Tenant’s total construction costs, together with such evidence of payment as is reasonably satisfactory to Landlord. Landlord shall pay the requested portion of the Excess Amount within thirty (30) days of receipt of request thereof, provided that Tenant has provided the information required herein. All such alterations and improvements to the Demised Premises must be performed in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, including, without limitation, the terms of Article XIX herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p392">In addition to the adjustment to the Basic Rent, if any, provided for in the second paragraph of this Section 3.2, there shall be an additional adjustment to annual Basic Rent in the event: (i) Tenant elects to modify the specifications with respect to the “Indirect Lighting” (as defined in Section 6102-Lighting of the Outline Plans And Specifications); and (ii) such modification results in a change in the cost of the Indirect Lighting so that the premium cost of the Indirect Lighting above the base building parabolic lighting as finally installed is other than $577,500.00. In the event Tenant requests a modification to these specifications, Landlord shall calculate the increased cost or savings resulting from such modification, and the annual Basic Rent for each full year of the Initial Term hereof shall be adjusted by the product of the increased cost, or the savings, as the case may be, multiplied by 0.105. The foregoing increase or reduction (as the case may be) to annual Basic Rent shall be prorated for any partial year based upon the ratio that the number of days in such partial year bears to 365.1</p>
          <p id="s1p393">If the Tenant elects to reduce the area of the Building using Indirect Lighting to less than 150,000 square feet, Landlord will provide standard parabolic lighting to that portion of the 150,000 square feet not covered by Indirect Lighting, all at no additional cost to Tenant. Once Landlord has calculated the increase or decrease in Basic Rent, as aforesaid, Landlord shall prepare and the parties shall execute an amendment to this Lease memorializing such increase or decrease.</p>
          <p id="s1p394">Section 3.3 Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p395">The Basic Rent shall be absolutely net to Landlord so that this Lease shall yield, net to Landlord, the Basic Rent specified in Section 3.1A in each year of the Term of this Lease and that all Impositions, insurance premiums, utility charges, maintenance, repair and replacement expenses (other than those required hereunder to be paid by Landlord), payments or charges under covenants, conditions and restrictions now or hereafter of record, all expenses relating to compliance with laws, and all other costs,</p>

          <p id="s1p397">For example, if the change in the Indirect Lighting specifications results in a $50,000.00 cost savings, then the annual Basic Rent will be reduced by $5,250.00 (being the product of (i) $50,000.00 multiplied by (ii) 0.105). If the change in the Indirect Lighting specifications results in a $50,000.00 cost increase, then the annual basic rent will be increased by $5,250.00 (being the product of (i) $50,000.00 multiplied by (ii) 0.105.</p>
          <p id="s1p398">16</p>
          <p id="s1p399">fees, charges, expenses, reimbursements and obligations of every kind and nature whatsoever relating to the Demised Premises (excepting only Landlord’s portion of the proration of real estate taxes and special assessments for the first and last years of the Term of this Lease referred to in Section 5.1 and certain taxes of Landlord referred to in the last sentence of Section 5.3 of this Lease) which may arise or become due during the Term or by reason of events occurring during the Term shall be paid or discharged by Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. The obligations of the parties with respect to the payment for the costs related to Landlord Items is controlled by Section 8.7 and not by the immediately preceding sentence. In the event Tenant fails to pay or discharge any imposition, insurance premium, utility charge, maintenance repair or replacement expense which it is obligated to pay or discharge, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to pay the same, and in that event Tenant shall immediately reimburse Landlord therefor and pay the same as additional rent (all charges payable by Tenant other than Basic Rent, however denoted, are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Additional Rent”), and Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and save Landlord harmless from and against such impositions, insurance premiums, utility charges, maintenance, repair and replacement expenses, all expenses relating to compliance with laws, and all other costs, fees, charges, expenses, reimbursements and obligations referred to above. Basic Rent and Additional Rent are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as “Rent”.</p>
          <p id="s1p400">Section 3.4 Delinquent Payments.</p>
          <p id="s1p401">All payments of Basic Rent and Additional Rent shall be payable without previous demand therefor and without any right of setoff or deduction whatsoever, and in case of nonpayment of any item of Additional Rent by Tenant when the same is due, Landlord shall have, in addition to all its other rights and remedies, all of the rights and remedies available to Landlord under the provisions of this Lease or by law in the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. The performance and observance by Tenant of all the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements to be performed or observed by Tenant hereunder shall be performed and observed by Tenant at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. Any installment of Basic Rent or Additional Rent or any other charges payable by Tenant under the provisions hereof which shall not be paid when due or within ten days thereafter shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to five percentage points per annum in excess of the published “prime rate” or “base rate” of interest charged by Norwest Bank Minnesota, NA (or similar institution if said Bank shall cease to exist or to publish such a prime rate) from the date when the same is due hereunder until the same shall be paid, but in no event in excess of the maximum lawful rate permitted to be charged by Landlord against Tenant. Said rate of interest is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “Maximum Rate of Interest”.</p>
          <p id="s1p402">In addition, any installment of Basic Rent or Additional Rent or any other charges payable by Tenant under the provisions hereof which shall not be paid when due and which remain unpaid ten days thereafter shall be subject to a late payment fee</p>
          <p id="s1p403">17</p>
          <p id="s1p404">of four percent (4%) of the unpaid amount. Tenant acknowledges that Tenant’s failure to pay Basic Rent or Additional Rent when due may cause Landlord to incur unanticipated costs. The exact amount of such costs are impractical or extremely difficult to ascertain. The parties agree that the late charge specified above represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of such late payment and acceptance of such late charge does not constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default or limit any other remedy of Landlord. The late charge shall be deemed to be Additional Rent and the right to require it shall be in addition to all of Landlord’s rights and remedies hereunder or at law.</p>

Impositions will not include any sum included in the Cost of the Work, as identified on Exhibit “B-1”.</p>
          <p id="s1p422">Tenant shall pay all special (or similar) assessments for public improvements or benefits which are currently levied or are levied or become a lien on the Demised Premises during the Term; provided, however, that if by law any special assessment is payable (without default) or, at the option of Landlord, may be paid (without default) in installments (whether or not interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance of such special assessment), Tenant may pay the same, together with any interest accrued on the unpaid balance of such special assessment, in installments as the same respectively become payable and before any fine, penalty, interest or cost may be added thereto for the nonpayment of any such installment and the interest thereon. Tenant shall pay all</p>
          <p id="s1p423">20</p>
          <p id="s1p424">special assessments or installments thereof (including interest accrued thereon), whether heretofore or hereafter laid, assessed, levied or imposed upon the Demised Premises, or any portion thereof, which are due and payable during the Term. Landlord shall pay all installments of special assessments (including interest accrued on the unpaid balance) which are due and payable prior to the Commencement Date and after the Termination Date. Tenant shall pay all real estate taxes, whether heretofore or hereafter levied or assessed upon the Demised Premises, or any portion thereof, which are due and payable during the Term. Landlord shall pay all real estate taxes which are due and payable prior to the Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall pay that portion of the real estate taxes and installments of special assessments due and payable in respect to the Demised Premises during the year the Term commences and the year in which the Term ends which the number of days in said year not within the Term bears to three hundred sixty-five (365), and Tenant shall pay the balance of said real estate taxes and installments of special assessments during said years.</p>
          <p id="s1p425">Section 5.2 Tenant’s Right to Contest Impositions.</p>
          <p id="s1p426">Tenant shall have the right, at its own expense, to contest the amount or validity, in whole or in part, of any Imposition by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, but only after payment of such Imposition (or provision of security therefor) reasonably acceptable to Landlord, unless such payment, or a payment thereof under protest, would operate as a bar to such contest or interfere materially with the prosecution thereof, in which event, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1 hereof, Tenant may postpone or defer payment of such Imposition if (a) neither the Demised Premises nor any portion thereof would, by reason of such postponement or deferment, be in danger of being forfeited or lost, and (b) Tenant shall have deposited with Landlord cash or a certificate of deposit or other security acceptable to Landlord in the amount of the Imposition so contested and unpaid, together with all interest and penalties which may accrue, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, in connection therewith, and all charges that may or might be assessed against or become a charge on the Demised Premises, or any portion thereof, during the pendency of such proceedings. If, during the continuance of such proceedings, Landlord shall, from time to time, reasonably deem the amount deposited, as aforesaid, insufficient, Tenant shall, upon demand of Landlord, make additional deposits of such additional sums of money or such additional certificates of deposit as Landlord may reasonably request. Upon failure of Tenant to make such additional deposits, the amount theretofore deposited may be applied by Landlord to the payment, removal and discharge of such Imposition, and the interest, fines and penalties in connection therewith, and any costs, fees (including attorneys’ fees) and other liability (including costs incurred by Landlord) accruing in any such proceedings.</p>
          <p id="s1p427">Upon the termination of any such proceedings, Tenant shall pay the amount of such Imposition or part thereof, if any, as finally determined in such proceedings, the</p>

          <p id="s1p429">payment of which may have been deferred during the prosecution of such proceedings, together with any costs, fees, including attorneys’ fees, interest, penalties, fines and other liability in connection therewith, and upon such payment Landlord shall return all amounts or certificates deposited with it with respect to the contest of such Imposition, as aforesaid, or, at the written direction of Tenant, Landlord shall make such payment out of the funds on deposit with Landlord and the balance, if any, shall be returned to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p430">Tenant shall be entitled to the refund of any Imposition, penalty, fine and interest thereon received by Landlord which have been paid by Tenant or which have been paid by Landlord but for which Landlord has been previously reimbursed in full by Tenant. Landlord shall not be required to join in any proceedings referred to in this Section 5.2 unless the provisions of any law, rule or regulation at the time in effect shall require that such proceedings be brought by or in the name of Landlord, in which event Landlord shall join in such proceedings or permit the same to be brought in Landlord’s name upon compliance with such conditions as Landlord may reasonably require. Landlord shall not ultimately be subject to any liability for the payment of any fees, including attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses in connection with such proceedings (referred to in this Section 5.2). Tenant agrees to pay all such fees, costs and expenses or, on demand, to make reimbursement to Landlord for such payment. During the time when any such certificate of deposit or other security is on deposit with Landlord, and prior to the time when the same is returned to Tenant or applied against the payment, removal or discharge of Impositions, as above provided, Tenant shall be entitled to receive all interest paid thereon, if any. If the deposit held by Landlord can be placed in an interest bearing account, Landlord will do so.</p>
          <p id="s1p431">Section 5.3 Levies and Other Taxes.</p>
          <p id="s1p432">If, at any time during the Term of this Lease, any method of taxation shall be such that there shall be levied, assessed or imposed on Landlord, or on the Basic Rent or Additional Rent, or on the Demised Premises or on the value of the Demised Premises, or any portion thereof, a capital levy, sales or use tax, gross receipts tax, transaction privilege tax, rent tax or other tax on the rents received therefrom, or a franchise tax, or an assessment, levy or charge measured by or based in whole or in part upon such rents or value, Tenant covenants to pay and discharge the same, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the rent to be paid hereunder shall be paid to Landlord absolutely net without deduction or charge of any nature whatsoever foreseeable or unforeseeable, ordinary or extraordinary, or of any nature, kind or description, except as in this Lease otherwise expressly provided. Nothing in this Lease contained shall require Tenant to pay any municipal, state or federal net income or excess profits taxes assessed against Landlord, or any municipal, state or federal capital levy, estate, succession, inheritance or transfer taxes of Landlord, or corporation franchise taxes imposed upon any corporate owner of the fee of the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p433">22</p>
          <p id="s1p434">Section 5.4 Evidence of Payment.</p>
          <p id="s1p435">Tenant covenants to furnish Landlord, within thirty (30) days after the date upon which any Imposition or other tax, assessment, levy or charge is payable by Tenant, official receipts of the appropriate taxing authority, or other appropriate proof reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, evidencing the payment of the same. The certificate, advice or bill of the appropriate official designated by law to make or issue the same or to receive payment of any Imposition or other tax, assessment, levy or charge may be relied upon by Landlord as sufficient evidence that such Imposition or other tax, assessment, levy or charge is due and unpaid at the time of the making or issuance of such certificate, advice or bill.</p>
          <p id="s1p436">Section 5.5 Escrow for Taxes and Assessments.</p>
          <p id="s1p437">At Landlord’s written demand, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the known or estimated yearly real estate taxes and assessments payable with respect to the Demised Premises in monthly payments equal to one-twelfth of the known or estimated yearly real estate taxes and assessments next payable with respect to the Demised Premises. From time to time Landlord may re-estimate the amount of real estate taxes and assessments, and in such event Landlord shall notify Tenant, in writing, of such re-estimate and fix future monthly installments for the remaining period prior to the next tax and assessment due date in an amount sufficient to pay the re-estimated amount over the balance of such period after giving credit for payments made by Tenant on the previous estimate. If the total monthly payments made by Tenant pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall exceed the amount of payments necessary for said taxes and assessments, such excess shall be credited on subsequent monthly payments of the same nature; but if the total of such monthly payments so made under this paragraph shall be insufficient to pay such taxes and assessments when due, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand such amount as may be necessary to make up the deficiency. Payment by Tenant of real estate taxes and assessments under this Section 5.5 shall be considered as performance of such obligation under the provisions of Section 5.1 hereof. Landlord agrees not to request such monthly deposits from Tenant so long as both of the following conditions are true: (i) Tenant has not defaulted in its obligation to timely pay Rent hereunder; and (ii) Landlord’s mortgage lender does not require Landlord to make such monthly deposits. If such monthly deposits are required by Landlord because Landlord’s mortgage lender has required Landlord to make such monthly deposits, then Landlord will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain agreement from said mortgage lender to hold said monthly deposits in an interest bearing account. In such event, all interest earned on said monthly deposits will be credited to Tenant.</p>

          <p id="s1p439">Section 5.6 Landlord’s Right to Contest Impositions.</p>
          <p id="s1p440">In addition to the right of Tenant under Section 5.2 to contest the amount or validity of Impositions, Landlord shall also have the right, but not the obligation, to contest the amount or validity, in whole or in part, of any Impositions not contested by Tenant, by appropriate proceedings conducted in the name of Landlord or in the name of Landlord and Tenant. If Landlord elects to contest the amount or validity, in whole or in part, of any Impositions, such contests by Landlord shall be at Landlord’s expense, provided, however, that if the amounts payable by Tenant for Impositions are reduced (or if a proposed increase in such amounts is avoided or reduced) by reason of Landlord’s contest of Impositions, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for costs incurred by Landlord in contesting Impositions, but such reimbursements shall not be in excess of the amount saved by Tenant by reason of Landlord’s actions in contesting such Impositions.</p>

          <p id="s1p442">INSURANCE</p>
          <p id="s1p443">Section 6.1 Tenant’s Casualty Insurance Obligations.</p>
          <p id="s1p444">Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall obtain and continuously maintain in full force and effect during the Term, commencing upon the earlier of the Commencement Date or the date Tenant first enters the Demised Premises to conduct any work, policies of insurance covering the Improvements (other than insurance on Tenant’s personal property which shall be maintained by Tenant as provided for in Section 6.5 herein) constructed, installed or located on the Demised Premises naming the Landlord and any additional parties designated by Landlord, as additional insureds and/or loss payees (as specified by Landlord), against (a) loss or damage by fire; (b) loss or damage from such other risks or hazards now or hereafter embraced by an “Extended Coverage Endorsement”, including, but not limited to, windstorm, hail, explosion, vandalism, riot and civil commotion, damage from vehicles, smoke damage, water damage and debris removal; (c) loss for flood if the Demised Premises is in a designated flood or flood insurance area or is in a flood prone area; (d) loss for damage by earthquake; (e) loss from so-called explosion, collapse and underground hazards; and (f) loss or damage from such other risks or hazards of a similar or dissimilar nature which are now or may hereafter be customarily insured against with respect to improvements similar in construction, design, general location, use and occupancy to the Improvements.

If a sprinkler system shall be located in the Improvements, sprinkler leakage insurance shall be procured and continuously maintained by Tenant at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. For the period</p>

          <p id="s1p570">(i) If default shall be made by Tenant, by operation of law or otherwise, under the provisions of Article XV hereof relating to assignment, sublease, mortgage or other transfer of Tenant’s interest in this Lease or in the Demised Premises or in the income arising therefrom;</p>
          <p id="s1p571">(ii) If default shall be made in the due and punctual payment of any Basic Rent or Additional Rent payable under this Lease or in the payment of any obligation to be paid by Tenant, when and as the same shall become due and payable, and said default is not cured within ten (10) days of written notice from Landlord. Notwithstanding the ten (10) day cure period in the immediately preceding sentence, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Basic Rent and Additional Rent is due and payable, without delay, on the various days specified elsewhere in this Lease and that the Maximum Rate of Interest and any late payment fees specified in Section 3.4 herein shall apply from the date Basic Rent and Additional Rent is first due.</p>
          <p id="s1p572">(iii) If default shall be made by Tenant in keeping, observing or performing any of the terms contained in this Lease, other than those referred to in Subsections (i), (ii) and (v) of this Section 12.1, which does not expose Landlord to criminal liability, and such default shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof given by Landlord to Tenant. In the case of such a default or contingency (other than one which may expose Landlord to criminal liability) which cannot with due diligence and in good faith be cured within thirty (30) days, if Tenant fails to proceed promptly and with due diligence and in good faith to cure the same or if Tenant fails to thereafter prosecute the curing of such default with due diligence and in good faith, or if such default is not cured within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof given by Landlord to Tenant, subject to matters of Excused Delay (but not including any delay caused or contributed to by act or neglect of Tenant or those acting for or under Tenant). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event Tenant fails to take out, pay for, maintain or deliver any of the insurance policies provided for in Article VI herein, Landlord need not give Tenant written notice or any period to cure such default prior to taking any actions authorized pursuant to Section 11.2 of this Lease; and</p>
          <p id="s1p573">42</p>
          <p id="s1p574">(iv) If default shall be made by Tenant in keeping, observing or performing any of the terms contained in this Lease, other than those referred to in Subsections (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) of this Section 12.1, and which reasonably exposes Landlord to criminal liability, and such default shall continue for five (5) days after written notice thereof given by Landlord to Tenant, and Tenant fails within said five (5) days to cure the same, it being intended that in connection with a default which reasonably exposes Landlord to criminal liability that Tenant shall proceed immediately to cure or correct such condition.</p>
          <p id="s1p575">(v) Tenant makes a general assignment or general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; (b) a petition for adjudication of bankruptcy or for reorganization or rearrangement is filed by Tenant or is filed against Tenant and with respect to a petition filed against Tenant if such petition is not dismissed within seventy (75) days; (c) a trustee or receiver is appointed to take possession of substantially all of Tenant’s assets located at the Demised Premises or of Tenant’s interest in this Lease and possession is not restored to Tenant within forty-five (45) days; or (d) substantially all of Tenant’s assets located at the Demised Premises or of Tenant’s interest in this Lease is subjected to attachment, execution or other judicial seizure not discharged within forty-five (45) days. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any of the acts described in this Section 12.1(v) does not constitute an Event of Default, and the court appoints a trustee to take possession of the Demised Premises (or if Tenant remains a debtor in possession of the Demised Premises) and such trustee or Tenant transfers Tenant’s interest hereunder, then Landlord is entitled to receive, as Additional Rent, any excess of the Rent (or any other consideration) paid in connection with the transfer over the Rent otherwise payable by Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p576">Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Landlord shall have the option to pursue any one or more of the remedies set forth in this Article XII without any notice or demand whatsoever, other than the notices specifically described above in this Section 12.1. The notices set forth in this Section are intended to satisfy any and all notice requirements imposed by law on Landlord and are not in addition to any such requirement.</p>

          <p id="s1p595">No repossession or re-entry of the Demised Premises shall relieve Tenant of its liabilities and obligations under this Lease (as if the Demised Premises had not been so repossessed or re-entered), and such liabilities and obligations shall survive any such repossession or re-entry. In the event of any expiration or termination, whether or not the Demised Premises or any portion thereof shall have been relet, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a sum equal to the Basic Rent, the Additional Rent and any other charges required to be paid by Tenant, up to the time of such expiration or termination, as provided for in Section 12.7A herein.</p>

Any such brokerage commissions, alteration costs or expenses of preparation of the Demised Premises actually recovered from a subsequent or replacement tenant shall not be recoverable from Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p601">Tenant shall pay the amounts determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 12.7A, (hereinafter called the “Deficiency”), to Landlord in monthly installments on the days on which the Basic Rent is payable under this Lease, and Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant each monthly installment of the Deficiency as the same shall arise.</p>

In the computation of present worth, a discount at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum shall be employed. Landlord and Tenant agree that Landlord’s actual damages would be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that the amount set forth herein represents a reasonable and fair estimate of Landlord’s actual damages. If the Demised Premises, or any portion thereof, be relet by Landlord for the unexpired Term, or any part thereof, before presentation of proof of such damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the amount of rent reserved upon such reletting shall, prima facie, be the fair and reasonable fair market rent for the part or the whole of the Demised Premises so relet during the term of the reletting. Nothing contained in this Section 12.8 or elsewhere in Article 12 shall limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to prove and obtain, as damages by reason of such expiration or termination, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in which, such damages are to be proved, whether or not such amount be greater, equal to or less than the amount of the difference referred to above.</p>

No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this Lease, and each of the terms of this Lease shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach of this Lease. No waiver of any default of Tenant herein shall be implied from any omission by Landlord to take any action on account of such default. No express waiver shall affect any default other than the default specified in the express waiver and that only for the time and to the extent therein stated. One or more waivers by Landlord shall not be construed as a waiver of a subsequent breach of the same covenant, teen or condition.</p>

The right of Tenant to terminate this Lease, as in this Section 14.2 provided, shall be exercisable only upon condition that Tenant is not then in default in the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease on its part to be performed, and such termination upon Tenant’s part shall become effective only upon compliance by Tenant with all such terms, covenants and conditions to the date of such termination. In the event that Tenant elects not to terminate this Lease as to the remainder of the Demised Premises, the rights and obligations of Landlord and Tenant shall be governed by the provisions of Section 14.3 hereof.</p>

Landlord will reimburse Tenant for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Tenant in effecting such cure, provided that Tenant has given Landlord at least fifteen (15) additional days’ notice of its intention to expend such sums. Nothing herein contained shall be construed or interpreted as requiring any mortgagee to remedy such act or omission.</p>

Nothing herein contained shall imply any duty upon the part of Landlord to do any such work which, under any provision of this Lease, Tenant may be required to perform and the performance thereof by Landlord shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default in failing to perform the same. Landlord may, during the progress of any work, keep and store upon the Demised Premises all necessary materials, tools and equipment. Landlord shall not in any event be liable for inconvenience, annoyance, disturbance, loss of business or other commercially unreasonable damage to Tenant by reason of making repairs or the performance of any work in or about the Demised Premises, or on account of bringing material, supplies and equipment into, upon or through the Demised Premises during the course thereof, and the obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall not be thereby affected in any manner whatsoever.

          <p id="s1p729">The occurrence of any event for which Tenant is required to indemnify Landlord under the terms of this Lease shall be referred to in this Section 20.3 as an “Indemnity Event”. Landlord agrees that, within sixty (60) days of the date that Landlord discovers the existence of an Indemnity Event, Landlord shall make a commercially reasonable effort to notify Tenant of the Indemnity Event. Landlord’s failure to so notify Tenant, however, will not impair Landlord’s right to assert a claim against Tenant for an Indemnity Event.

Any damage caused to the Building or any part thereof which results from the installation, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement or removal of the Satellite Dish shall be repaired or replaced promptly by Tenant. Tenant shall not install the Satellite Dish until Landlord has approved the plans and specifications for the design and installation (including, without limitation, screening) thereof. Upon the termination of this Lease or Tenant’s right to maintain the Satellite Dish, Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall remove the Satellite Dish and shall restore the roof of the Building to its condition existing prior to the installation of the Satellite Dish, ordinary wear and tear accepted. Tenant shall further repair, at its sole cost and expense, any damage or destruction caused by the removal of the Satellite Dish.</p>
          <p id="s1p845">72</p>
          <p id="s1p846">If Landlord proposes to construct improvements on the property which will be (after recording of the Bass Creek Business Park 4th Addition) legally described as Lot 1, Block 1, which will be more than 986.6 feet above sea level, then the Landlord will provide the Tenant with notice of such proposal and will afford the Tenant the right to install the Satellite Dish, together with appropriate cabling, on the roof of the Improvements located on Lot 1, Block 1. Landlord will, prior to the Commencement Date hereof, execute and record a restrictive covenant on the title Lot 1, Block 1, Bass Creek Business Park 4th Addition which restrictive covenant will confirm the foregoing. That restrictive covenant will provide that it cannot be amended or modified without the consent of the Landlord, and the Landlord agrees with the Tenant not to modify or amend that restrictive covenant.</p>

          <p id="s1p848">TERMS OF OPTION TO RENEW</p>
          <p id="s1p849">Section 22.1 Terms of Option to Renew.</p>
          <p id="s1p850">The Tenant’s right to exercise the Renewal Terms referenced in Section 1.2 of this Lease shall not be assignable by Tenant, shall not exerciseable by a sublessee but shall be upon the following terms and conditions and subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth:</p>
          <p id="s1p851">(i) That at the time of the “Request for Market Rent” (as defined herein) and at the time hereinafter set forth for the exercise of each option with respect to a Renewal Term or the commencement of each Renewal Term, as the case may be, this Lease shall be in full force and effect and there shall be no uncured Event of Default hereunder by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p852">(ii) The annual Basic Rent during each Renewal Term shall, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, be equal to ninety-five percent (95%) of the “Market Rent” (as defined herein) and shall be payable in equal monthly installments equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the annual Basic Rent as established for each Renewal Term, in advance on the first day of each calendar month during each Renewal Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p853">(iii) Except as otherwise specifically provided in subsection (ii) above, the Renewal Terms shall be upon the same terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Lease. All other payments on the part of Tenant to be made as provided in this Lease shall continue to be paid during each Renewal Term including, but without limitation, all payments of Additional Rent as required herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p854">(iv) “Market Rent” means the annual Basic Rent which Landlord would receive by renting the Demised Premises including all building, structure and fixtures</p>
          <p id="s1p855">73</p>
          <p id="s1p856">erected thereon, together with all additions, alterations and replacements thereof in their condition and configuration as of the time of determination of Market Rent assuming the Landlord to be a prudent person willing to lease but being under no compulsion to do so, and assuming the Tenant to be a renewal tenant and prudent person willing to lease but being under no compulsion to do so, assuming a lease term equal to the term in question, assuming a lease containing the same terms and provisions as those contained in this Lease, and giving due regard to all economic factors; including, without limitation, the size and use of the Demised Premises, a location in the Southwest, Northwest or West suburbs of Minneapolis, the quality and age of the Building, the extent of services provided by the Landlord, applicable distinctions between “gross” leases and “net” leases, the creditworthiness and quality of Tenant, leasing commissions payable in the market, any inducements, or rental concessions, if any, and any other relevant term or condition in making such evaluation, including the benefit to Landlord of having the Demised Premises immediately rent producing at the date in question.</p>
          <p id="s1p857">(v) Upon determination of the Basic Rent for the Renewal Term, the parties will execute an Amendment to this Lease confirming the Renewal Term and the Basic Rent, as determined below.</p>
          <p id="s1p858">Section 22.2 Exercise of Option to Renew.</p>
          <p id="s1p859">If Tenant elects to exercise an option to extend the Term of this Lease, it shall do so as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p860">(i) Tenant shall notify Landlord, in writing, of its desire for a determination of Market Rent, such notice to be given no sooner than five hundred thirty (530) days and no later than five hundred (500) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the first Renewal Term (as the case may be), time being of the essence with respect to such notice (the “Request for Market Rent”).</p>
          <p id="s1p861">During the sixty (60) day period following the receipt of the Request for Market Rent, Landlord and Tenant will meet on at least two (2) occasions at the Demised Premises and attempt to agree upon the “Market Rent” for the Demised Premises for the Renewal Teem in question. The Landlord and the Tenant will each submit their final best offer for Market Rent to the other in writing before the end of that sixty (60) day period (referred to as the “Landlord’s and Tenant’s Final Offer”).</p>
          <p id="s1p862">If the parties are unable to agree upon the Market Rent for the Renewal Term during such sixty (60) day period, Tenant shall, (on or before the date which is seventy (70) days after delivery of the Request for Market Rent) either: (i) withdraw its Request for Market Rent; or (ii) deliver an “Appraisal Request” to Landlord. If Tenant does neither, it will be deemed to have elected (i) above. If Tenant withdraws, or is deemed to have withdrawn, the Request for Market Rent, Tenant’s option to</p>
          <p id="s1p863">74</p>
          <p id="s1p864">renew the Term, and all succeeding options, shall terminate. Tenant shall be deemed to have made the irrevocable election to exercise the next available Renewal Term at such time as Tenant delivers an Appraisal Request to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p865">(ii) If Tenant gives Landlord a timely Appraisal Request, each party will, within twenty (20) days, choose a person with at least five (5) years experience as a real estate appraiser of income producing assembly and office property in the market area who shall be a member in good standing of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers (or successor organization or if no such organization exists then persons of similar professional qualifications), with the designation M.A.I., and give notice of the name and address of such person to the other within twenty (20) days of the notice of disagreement from Tenant. Those two persons shall within five (5) days select a third person who is experienced in the determination of commercial rental rates for office space in the market area and the three persons (the “Experts”) shall make a determination of Market Rent as expeditiously as possible thereafter and in any event within thirty (30) days after the selection of the third Expert. The Landlord’s and the Tenant’s Final Offer will be given to the Experts for the purposes of their review in making their determination. The determination of the Experts shall be made no later than the date which is 365 days prior to the end of the Term and shall be made as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p866">(a)</p>
          <p id="s1p867">Each Expert will independently determine the Market Rent and then will meet and simultaneously disclose to the other their respective determinations.</p>
          <p id="s1p868">(b)</p>
          <p id="s1p869">If neither the highest nor the lowest determination differs from the middle determination by more than ten percent (10%) of such middle determination, then the Market. Rent shall be the average of all three determinations.</p>
          <p id="s1p870">(c)</p>
          <p id="s1p871">If subparagraph (b) does not apply, then the Market Rent shall be the average of the two determinations closest by dollar amounts.</p>
          <p id="s1p872">(d)</p>
          <p id="s1p873">The Experts shall promptly notify Landlord and Tenant of each of their separate determinations and the resulting Market Rent. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, the said appraisal Market Rent determination shall be conducted in accordance with the rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon any appraisal decision rendered may be entered by any Court having jurisdiction thereof. The determination of Market Rent pursuant to this procedure shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p874">75</p>
          <p id="s1p875">Each party will pay any and all fees and expenses incurred in connection with such party’s Expert and the fees and expenses for the third Expert will be borne equally by the parties except that if the Market Rent resulting from any determination under this Article is equal to or greater than ninety-five (95%) percent of the amount of Market Rent set forth in Landlord’s notice to Tenant, then Tenant shall pay all fees and expenses of all three of the Experts.</p>
          <p id="s1p876">There shall be no further additional right to renew this Lease other than as herein set forth, and Tenant’s failure to timely and effectively make its Request for Market Rent or to exercise the first Renewal Term shall extinguish its rights thereto as well as Tenant’s right to exercise the second Renewal Term. Any termination of this Lease shall terminate the right of renewal contained hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p877">ARTICLE XXIII</p>
          <p id="s1p878">TENANT’S OPTION TO EXPAND BUILDING</p>
          <p id="s1p879">Section 23.1 Tenant’s Option to Expand Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p880">Pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Lease, Landlord has agreed to construct the Improvements (for purposes of this Article XXIII, the Improvements are sometimes hereinafter referred to as “Phase One Improvements”). Subject to the terms of this Article, Landlord hereby further agrees that, at the written request of Tenant, Landlord will erect upon the Land an expansion to the Phase One Improvements consisting of an expansion of the Building on the portion of the Land immediately to the South of the Building (the expansion of the Phase One Improvements is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “Phase Two Improvements”. The Phase Two Improvements will consist of no more than 60,000 gross square feet of additional building. The Phase Two Improvements will be completed in accordance with the provisions of Sections 23.2 through 23.9 hereof, inclusive. Tenant shall make its election to exercise its right to expand the Building by written notice to Landlord (the “Expansion Notice”). Subject to the provisions hereof regarding a Term Extension, the Expansion Notice may be given at any time prior to the expiration of the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p881">Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Expansion Notice, Landlord and Tenant will meet a minimum of two (2) times to discuss and to attempt to agree upon schematic plans and specifications for the Phase Two Improvements (the “Schematics”). Landlord is not required to approve the Schematics to the extent that they will, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, impair the structural or mechanical integrity or diminish the value of the Demised Premises. Within that same thirty day (30) period, Landlord will furnish Tenant with a site plan showing the proposed Phase Two Improvements (the “Site Plan”). The Schematics, the Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications and the Site Plan will be prepared at the initial cost of the Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p882">76</p>
          <p id="s1p883">Following written approval of the Schematics by Landlord and Tenant, Landlord will proceed with the preparation of the “Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications” which will be developed from the Schematics. The Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications will be submitted to Tenant for its approval within sixty (60) days of said approval of the Schematics and will contain similar detail as are contained in the Outline Plans and Specifications attached hereto as Exhibit “B”.</p>
          <p id="s1p884">Within twenty (20) days following receipt of the Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications, Tenant will either approve the same or request such changes as it deems appropriate, which changes will then be incorporated into the Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications by Landlord. Landlord and Tenant will agree upon the Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications within sixty (60) days of their approval of the Schematics. Landlord will have no obligation to make changes to the Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications which, in Landlord’s judgment, will impair the structural or mechanical integrity of the Building or, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, diminish the value of the Demised Premises. During the development of the Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications, Landlord will, at Tenant’s cost, make application for all required governmental approvals for the Phase Two Improvements (the “Phase Two Permits”) and will diligently pursue the issuance of those Phase Two Permits. Delay or failure of issuance of the Phase Two Permits will constitute Excused Delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p885">Upon approval of the Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications by Landlord and Tenant, Landlord will advise the Tenant whether, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, the construction of the Phase Two Improvements can be Substantially Completed on or before the date which is five (5) full calendar years prior to the expiration of the Term (as it may have been previously extended), and if not Landlord will advise the Tenant when the Landlord estimates that the Phase Two Improvements will be Substantially Complete (the “Landlord’s Completion Estimate”). For the purpose of the Phase Two Improvements, the term “Substantial Completion” will have the same meaning given it in Section 2.5. After receipt of the Landlord’s Completion Estimate, and as a prerequisite to the Landlord’s obligation to further proceed with the preparation of the Phase Two Final Plans and Specifications, Tenant must execute and deliver to Landlord an “Expansion Amendment” (as hereinafter defined). The Expansion Amendment will be executed, if at all, upon: (i) Tenant’s election as to payment for the Phase Two Improvements, as contemplated in Section 23.4, (ii) determination of the “Phase One Improvements Basic Rent” for the Term Extension, or the delivery by Tenant of an “Arbitration Demand” with respect to the Phase One Improvements Basic Rent for the Term Extension (as both of those terms are defined in Section 23.10).</p>
          <p id="s1p886">The “Expansion Amendment”, which will be prepared by Landlord, will provide as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p887">(i) If, pursuant to the Landlord’s Completion Estimate, the Phase Two Improvements will not be Substantially Complete on or before the date which is five (5) full calendar years prior to the expiration of the Term (as the same may have previously been extended by reason of the Tenant’s exercise of Renewal Terms), and if the Tenant elects to pay for the Phase Two Improvements pursuant to Section 23.4.1, then the Expansion Amendment, once executed by Tenant, will constitute an irrevocable election by Tenant to extend the Term of this Lease so that the Term (as it may previously have been extended) will expire on a date which is five (5) full calendar years after the date of the Substantial Completion of the Phase Two Improvements. The period of time by which the Term is extended by reason of the Expansion Amendment is called the “Term Extension”.</p>
          <p id="s1p888">77</p>
          <p id="s1p889">(ii) The Phase One Improvements Basic Rent for the Term Extension (if a Term Extension is required) will be determined in one of two methods and will be incorporated into the Expansion Amendment. Those methods are more fully described in Section 23.10. If the Phase One Improvements Basic Rent has in fact been agreed upon, then the Expansion Amendment will contain that agreement. If an Arbitration Demand has been delivered by the Tenant with respect to the Phase One Improvements Basic Rent, then the Expansion Amendment will identify the date by which the arbitrators are to determine the Phase One Improvements Basic Rent. The fact that the Phase One Improvements Basic Rent for the Term Extension may not be determined until after execution of the Expansion Amendment will not permit the Tenant to rescind the Expansion Amendment, it being the intention of the parties that the execution of the Expansion Amendment will irrevocably serve to extend the Term of this Lease for the Term Extension notwithstanding that the Phase One Improvements Basic Rent may not yet be established.</p>
          <p id="s1p890">(iii) As is set forth in 23.3, the Tenant must elect to pay for the Phase Two Improvements either through the “Phase Two Basic Rent” or through the “Construction Price” (as those terns are defined in Section 23.3). The Expansion Amendment will document which election Tenant has chosen and will obligate the Tenant to make the payments required by reason of that election.</p>
          <p id="s1p891">(iv) If the Tenant pays for the Phase Two Improvements by paying the Construction Price, then the Expansion Amendment will contain provisions amending Article XIV of this Lease to provide that Tenant shall receive a proportion of any condemnation award received on account of a condemnation of the Phase Two Improvements, Tenant’s proportion to be determined by multiplying the Phase Two condemnation award by a percentage derived by dividing the unexpired Term as of the date of the taking of the Phase Two Improvements by the unexpired Term as of the date of Substantial Completion of the Phase Two Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p892">78</p>
          <p id="s1p893">Section 23.2 Design of Phase Two Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p894">Upon execution of the Expansion Amendment, Landlord will commence the preparation of the “Phase Two Final Plans and Specifications” so as to be consistent with the approved Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications, satisfy any physical requirements of the site and to comply with all applicable building and zoning regulations and orders of any duly constituted authority applicable to construction of said Phase Two Improvements or the use thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p895">Section 23.3 Cost of Phase Two Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p896">At the time the final Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications are approved (which the parties will do following the provisions set forth in Section 2.1 hereof), Landlord will inform Tenant of the proposed increase in Basic Rent attributable to the Phase Two Improvements (the “Phase Two Basic Rent”) and Landlord’s “Construction Price” (as hereinafter defined) for the Phase Two Improvements. The “Construction Price” shall include all costs, in the categories identified on Exhibit B-1, to be incurred in construction the Phase Two Improvements together with legal costs and other costs of financing of the Demised Premises, if required, financing the Phase Two Improvements, interim financing during the construction period and costs for the preparation of the Site Plan, the schematics, the Phase Two Outline Plans and Specifications and the Phase Two Final Plans and Specifications.</p>
          <p id="s1p897">If Tenant is dissatisfied with such proposed Phase Two Basic Rent or the Construction Price, it may solicit bids to include all categories included within the Construction Price from two or more financially responsible building contractors experienced in constructing buildings similar to the proposed Phase Two Improvements and which are reasonably acceptable to Landlord. The contractors identified on Exhibit “G” (the “ Unacceptable Contractor List”) will not be acceptable contractors. Each of such financially responsible building contractors shall accompany its bid with a bid bond in the amount of its bid, issued by an acceptable commercial surety licensed to do business in the State of Minnesota, and shall agree to furnish a completion bond, including a bond against claims for labor and materials as well as the completion of such Phase Two Improvements. The competing bids shall include a sum for design and interim financing and shall provide for no progress payments; but, in place of such payments, there shall be one payment for the entire work due and payable upon completion of the work and acceptance by Landlord and Tenant. In determining whether the Construction Price of Landlord is in excess of the bid of the lowest financially responsible contractor submitting a bid, the premiums for the completion bond and mechanic’s lien bond shall be eliminated from such computation.</p>
          <p id="s1p898">79</p>
          <p id="s1p899">If the Construction Price of Landlord is greater than one hundred three percent (103%) of the bid of the lowest financially responsible contractor submitting a bid (with all required bonds), Landlord shall elect OPTION A below. If the Construction Price of Landlord is equal to or less than one hundred three percent (103%) of the bid of the lowest financially responsible contractor submitting a bid (with all required bonds), Landlord shall, within fifteen (15) days, elect OPTION A or OPTION B below. OPTION A will be for Landlord to enter into a construction contract (as Owner) on terms acceptable to Landlord with the contractor submitting the lower bid providing for the construction of the Phase Two Improvements by that contractor. Landlord will have no obligation to enter into that construction contract until Tenant has executed an agreement reasonably satisfactory to Landlord pursuant to which Tenant is obligated to pay (and provide security with respect to that obligation) the sums due under that construction contract. OPTION B will be for Landlord to lower its Construction Price to a sum equal to the lowest competing bid. If Landlord elects OPTION B, then the Construction Price shall be the Construction Price as so adjusted pursuant to said election.</p>
          <p id="s1p900">If the Construction Price of Landlord is less than the competitive bids, then Tenant may elect, pursuant to Section 23.4, to have the Phase Two Improvements constructed by Landlord at Landlord’s Construction Price.</p>
          <p id="s1p901">Tenant shall not be given possession of, nor shall Tenant be obligated to Landlord for the payment of Basic Rent or Additional Rent, with respect to, the Phase Two Improvements until the Phase Two Improvements are Substantially Completed (as defined in Section 2.5) herein in accordance with the Phase Two Final Plans and Specifications. Delay in putting Tenant in possession of said Phase Two Improvements shall not serve to extend the Term of this Lease or to make Landlord liable for any direct, indirect, special or consequential damages arising therefrom.</p>
          <p id="s1p902">Section 23.4 Payment for Phase Two Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p903">After final determination of the Phase Two Basic Rent and the Construction Price as contemplated by Section 23.3, Tenant shall elect one of the following options:</p>
          <p id="s1p904">23.4.1 To have the Landlord construct the Phase Two Improvements (and pay the Phase Two Basic Rent);</p>
          <p id="s1p905">23.4.2 To have the Phase Two Improvements constructed by the lowest bidding contractor and pay the Construction Price to Landlord in cash (if Landlord elects OPTION A as set forth in Section 23.3);</p>
          <p id="s1p906">23.4.3 To have the Phase Two Improvements constructed by Landlord and pay the Construction Price to Landlord in cash (if Landlord elects OPTION B as set forth in Section 23.3); or</p>
          <p id="s1p907">80</p>
          <p id="s1p908">23.4.4 To withdraw the Expansion Notice, in which event the Tenant’s right to cause the construction of the Phase Two Improvements will be deemed terminated and of no further force or effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p909">Tenant shall promptly make such election and (except in the event of Section 23.4.4) execute the Expansion Amendment, as well as other documentation contemplated hereby, prior to commencement of construction of the Phase Two Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p910">If Tenant elects 23.4.1 above, then, upon the date that the Phase Two Improvements are Substantially Completed, the Basic Rent payable under Article III of this Lease shall be increased by the amount of the Phase Two Basic Rent, the other sums payable by the Tenant hereunder will be adjusted to reflect the increase in the Demised Premises attributable to the Phase Two Improvements and the agreements to be paid, kept, observed and performed by Tenant under this Lease shall thereupon become applicable to the Phase Two Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p911">If Tenant elects 23.4.2 or 23.4.3 above, and provided Tenant furnishes reasonably adequate security for the payment of such costs, as reasonably determined by Landlord, and pays all construction costs as the same become payable, the Basic Rent shall not be adjusted as a result of the construction of the Phase Two Improvements. If Tenant elects 23.4.2 or 23.4.3, Tenant must pay the entire Construction Price. If Tenant elects 23.4.2, Tenant must deliver final lien waivers as required by Landlord with respect to the Phase Two Improvements. If Tenant elects 23.4.3, Tenant must provide the funds required in order for Landlord to obtain such final lien waivers.</p>
          <p id="s1p912">It is understood and agreed that notwithstanding payment of all construction costs for the Phase Two Improvements by Tenant, upon installation, all Phase Two Improvements, except Tenant’s moveable trade fixtures, shall become the property of Landlord. In the event Tenant elects 23.4.2 or 23.4.3, Tenant will not be given possession of the Phase Two Improvements until all sums payable by Tenant are paid. If Tenant elects 23.4.4, then Tenant’s option to expand the Demised Premises shall terminate.</p>
          <p id="s1p913">Section 23.5 Completion of Phase Two Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p914">Upon execution of the Expansion Amendment and approval of the Phase Two Final Plans and Specifications, and provided that Tenant has elected Section 23.4.1 or 23.4.3, Landlord shall, subject to Excused Delay, diligently proceed with the construction of the Phase Two Improvements and complete the same and deliver possession thereof to Tenant within a reasonable time thereafter. Landlord will give Tenant written notice of any such Excused Delay specifying the nature and the period</p>
          <p id="s1p915">81</p>
          <p id="s1p916">of such Excused Delay within thirty (30) days after the occurrence thereof. The time of completion of said construction shall be extended for the additional time caused by such Excused Delay. If Tenant elects Section 23.4.2, then Landlord will, at Tenant’s cost, enforce the construction contract entered into by Landlord, but Landlord will have no obligation to assure timely Substantial Completion of the Phase Two Improvements. If the Phase Two Improvements are not Substantially Complete by the date required by said construction contract, or if the contractor thereunder materially defaults in its obligations, Landlord may complete the Phase Two Improvements following thirty (30) days notice to Tenant and Tenant’s failure to either cure said default by the contractor or commence and diligently prosecute the completion of the Phase Two Improvements. If the Landlord completes the Phase Two Improvements as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, Tenant will pay Landlord, as Additional Rent, all sums incurred by Landlord in so completing the Phase Two Improvement, together with interest at the Maximum Rate of Interest.</p>
          <p id="s1p917">Section 23.6 Tenant’s Right to Inspect.</p>
          <p id="s1p918">During the period of construction of Phase Two Improvements and provided Landlord is constructing the Phase Two Improvements, Tenant or its designated agent or agents shall have the right of inspect and Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant or its designated agent or agents with respect to any such inspection and facilitate the same as long as such inspection does not interfere with the work of Landlord in completing the Phase Two Improvements. In the event Landlord elects to allow another contractor to perform the Phase Two Improvements, as provided for in Section 23.3 herein, during the period of such construction (and without limitation of Landlord’s other rights set forth in this Lease), Landlord shall have the right to inspect and Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in the inspection of such work.</p>
          <p id="s1p919">Section 23.7 Compliance with Plans and Specifications.</p>
          <p id="s1p920">At least five (5) days prior to Substantial Completion of the Phase Two Improvements by Tenant, and provided that Landlord constructed the Phase Two Improvements, Landlord and Tenant will agree upon a list of all punch list items not completed in accordance with the Phase Two Final Plans and Specifications and Landlord shall forthwith complete said punch list items. The acceptance of possession of the Phase Two Improvements by Tenant shall be deemed conclusively to establish that the Phase Two Improvements have been Substantially Completed, subject to any punchlist items; provided, however, that Tenant may supplement the punch list by identifying punch list items which Tenant establishes were deficiencies in the Phase Two Improvements as of the date of Substantial Completion, so long as such supplemental punch list items are identified for Landlord within one hundred twenty (120) days following Substantial Completion. Provided that Landlord constructed the Phase Two Improvements Landlord will complete said supplemental punch list items within sixty (60) days, or such longer period as may be reasonably required.</p>
          <p id="s1p921">82</p>
          <p id="s1p922">If Landlord did not construct the Phase Two Improvements, the failure to complete the Phase Two Improvements will not excuse the Tenant’s obligation to pay for them, pursuant to the terms hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p923">Section 23.8 Guaranty of Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p924">Provided that Landlord constructs the Phase Two Improvements, Landlord guarantees the Phase Two Improvements and such other items as are covered by the final plans and specifications against defective workmanship and/or defective materials for a period of one year from the date of Substantial Completion of the Phase Two Improvements.

          <p id="s1p1033">and fixtures located therein, together with all additions, alterations and replacements thereof, in their condition and configuration as of the time of determination of Market Rent, assuming the Landlord to be a prudent person willing to lease but being under no compulsion to do so, and assuming the Tenant to be a renewal tenant and a prudent person willing to lease but being under no compulsion to do so, assuming a lease term equal to the term in question, assuming a lease containing the same terms and provisions as the multi-tenant office lease agreement then utilized by Landlord, and giving due regard to all economic factors; including without limitation, the size and use of the Demised Premises, a location in the Southwest, Northwest or West suburbs of Minneapolis (the “Market Area”), the quality and age of the Building, the extent of services provided by the Landlord, applicable distinctions between “gross” leases and “net” leases, the creditworthiness and quality of Tenant, leasing commissions payable in the market, any inducements, or rental concessions, if any, and any other relevant term or condition in making such evaluation, including the benefit to Landlord of having the Demised Premises immediately rent producing at the date in question.</p>
          <p id="s1p1034">10.3 Request for Market Rent. The Notice of Exercise will be deemed to be a “Request for Market Rent”. During the sixty (60) day period following the receipt of the Request for Market Rent, Landlord and Tenant will meet on at least two (2) occasions at the Demised Premises and attempt to agree upon the Market Rent for the Demised Premises for the initial term of the New Lease. The Landlord and the Tenant will each submit their final best offer for Market Rent to the other in writing before the end of that sixty (60) day period (referred to as the “Landlord’s and Tenant’s Final Offer”).</p>
          <p id="s1p1035">10.4 Appraisal Request. If the parties are unable to agree upon the Market Rent for the initial term of the New Lease during such sixty (60) day period, Tenant shall on or before the date which is seventy (70) days after delivery of the Request for Market Rent either: (a) withdraw its Request for Market Rent; or (b) deliver an “Appraisal Request” to Landlord. If Tenant does neither, it will be deemed to have elected (a) above. If Tenant withdraws, or is deemed to have withdrawn, the Request for Market Rent, the New Lease Right and the extension option will terminate. Tenant will be deemed to have made the irrevocable election to exercise the New Lease Right at such time as Tenant delivers an Appraisal Request to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p1036">10.5 Determination of Market Rent. If Tenant gives Landlord a timely Appraisal Request, each party will, within twenty (20) days, choose a person with at least five (5) years’ experience as a real estate appraiser of income-producing assembly and office property in the Market Area, who shall be a member in good standing of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers (or successor organization, or if no such organization exists, then persons of similar professional qualifications) with the designation of M.A.I., and give notice of the name and address of such person to the other within twenty (20) days of the notice of disagreement from Tenant. Those two persons shall within five (5) days select a third person who is experienced in the determination of commercial rental rates for office space in the Market Area, and the three persons (the “Experts”) shall make a determination of Market Rent for the initial term of the New Lease as expeditiously as possible thereafter, and in any event within</p>
          <p id="s1p1037">6</p>
          <p id="s1p1038">thirty (30) days after the selection of the third Expert. The Landlord’s and Tenant’s Final Offer will be given to the Experts for the purposes of their review in making their determination. The determination of the Experts shall be made no later than the date which is three hundred sixty-five (365) days prior to the end of the Term of the Lease and shall be made as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p1039">10.5.1 Each Expert will independently determine the Market Rent for the initial term of the New Lease and then will meet and simultaneously disclose to the other their respective determinations.</p>
          <p id="s1p1040">10.5.2 If neither the highest nor the lowest determination differs from the middle determination by more than ten percent (10%) of such middle determination, then the Market Rent for the initial term of the New Lease will be the average of all three determinations.</p>
          <p id="s1p1041">10.5.3 If Section 10.5.2 does not apply, then the Market Rent for the initial term of the New Lease will be the average of the two determinations closest by dollar amounts.</p>
          <p id="s1p1042">10.5.4 The Experts will promptly notify Landlord and Tenant of each of their separate determinations and the resulting Market Rent. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, the Market Rent determination shall be conducted in accordance with the rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon any appraisal decision rendered may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The determination of Market Rent pursuant to this procedure shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p1043">10.5.5 The annual Basic Rent for the initial term of the New Lease shall, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, be equal to ninety-five percent (95%) of the “Market Rent” (as defined and determined above) and shall be payable in equal monthly installments equal to one-twelfth ( 1 /12) of the annual Basic Rent as established for the initial term of the New Lease, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month during the initial term of the New Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p1044">10.6 Costs. Each party will pay any and all fees and expenses incurred in connection with such party’s Expert and the fees and expenses for the third Expert will be borne equally by the parties, except that if the Market Rent resulting from any determination under this Article is equal to or greater than ninety-five percent (95%) of the amount of Market Rent set forth in Landlord’s notice to Tenant, then Tenant shall pay all fees and expenses of all three of the Experts.</p>
          <p id="s1p1045">10.7 Extension Option of the New Lease. The Basic Rent for the extension term of the New Lease will be determined upon the same terms, covenants and conditions as contained in this Section 10.</p>
          <p id="s1p1046">11. In the event Tenant fails to perform its obligations under this Amendment, in addition to the remedies available to Landlord pursuant to Article 12 of the Lease, Landlord will have the right to pursue one or more of the following remedies: Default Remedies.</p>
          <p id="s1p1047">7</p>
          <p id="s1p1048">11.1 Event of Default under Lease. In the event Tenant fails to do (a) or (b) below, such failure will be deemed an Event of Default under the Lease and Landlord will have the right to pursue and apply any one or more of the remedies available to Landlord under the Lease to the Reduction Space and the Suite 350 Data Space:</p>
          <p id="s1p1049">(a) pay in full all costs and expenses incurred in completing the improvements to the Reduction Space as required by Section 1.3.3 and any mechanic’s lien or other lien is filed against the Property and not removed or bonded around with a bond satisfactory to Landlord within thirty (30) days of the date of filing, or</p>
          <p id="s1p1050">(b) perform as required by this Amendment for a period of ten (10) days after delivery of written notice from Landlord to Tenant, provided however, if such failure to perform cannot with due diligence and in good faith be cured within such ten (10) day period, and Tenant commences to cure the failure within such ten (10) day period and thereafter diligently pursues such cure in good faith, then such period shall be extended for the reasonable period required to cure the failure not to exceed sixty (60) days.</p>
          <p id="s1p1051">11.2 Self Help. If Tenant fails to take any action which Tenant is obligated to take pursuant to Exhibit D attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (other than Section 2D), which action is (a) specific to the Property (as opposed to a failure which is caused by an interruption or curtailment of services which extends beyond the Property), (b) is not caused by an event of force majeure, damage or destruction pursuant to Article XIII of the Lease, or condemnation pursuant to Article XIV of the Lease, and (c) is not caused by an act or failure to act of Landlord or any tenant of the Building, specifically including but not limited to an event of default by any tenant of the Building under its lease, Landlord may deliver written notice thereof to Tenant (the “Initial Notice”). The Initial Notice must specifically describe the action that is required of Tenant to satisfy the requirements of Exhibit D attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. If within thirty (30) days of delivery of Landlord’s Initial Notice, Tenant fails to cure or commence to cure the items specified in the Initial Notice, Landlord may deliver to Tenant a second notice (the “Reminder Notice”). The Reminder Notice must include a copy of the Initial Notice and specify that Landlord will have the rights granted under this Section 11.2 if Tenant fails to cure or commence to cure the specified items within fifteen (15) Business Days of delivery of the Reminder Notice. If Tenant fails to take or commence to take the required action within fifteen (15) Business Days of receiving the Reminder Notice, or once commenced fails to diligently pursue the required action to completion, then Landlord may take, or cause others to take, the action that Tenant failed to perform. Tenant will reimburse Landlord for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Landlord or such other parties in taking such action within twenty-five (25) days after delivery of an invoice by Landlord to Tenant setting forth a reasonably particularized breakdown of such costs and expenses. Such costs and expenses will be deemed Additional Rent under the Lease. Tenant will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord against all loss or liability resulting from the failure of Tenant to pay or perform as required by this Section 11.2. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding,</p>
          <p id="s1p1052">8</p>
          <p id="s1p1053">in the case of emergency, Landlord shall not be bound by the notice and cure periods set forth in this Section 11.2 and Landlord shall have the right to immediately take, or cause others to take, the action that Tenant failed to perform.</p>
          <p id="s1p1054">11.3 Interruption of Electrical Power. If there is an interruption in electrical power to the central station and monitoring center in the Suite 300 Space that (a) is specific to the Property (as opposed to an interruption or curtailment in electrical power which extends beyond the Property), (b) is caused by the failure of Tenant to perform as required by Section 2D of Exhibit D attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, (c) causes the central station and monitoring center in the Suite 300 Space to be untenantable, (d) is not caused by an event of force majeure, fire or casualty to the Suite 300 Space, or condemnation of the Suite 300 Space, (e) is not caused by an act or failure to act of Landlord or the tenant of the Suite 300 Space, specifically including but not limited to an event of default by the tenant of the Suite 300 Space under its lease, (f) is not caused by a failure of the generator(s) operated by the tenant of the Suite 300 Space, and (g) lasts for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, then Landlord will be entitled to deliver Tenant a written notice stating that if Tenant does not commence to cure the untenantability caused by the interruption within one (1) Business Day from the date of delivery of the notice and complete the cure within ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of the notice, Landlord will be entitled to an abatement of the payment required by Section 4 of this Amendment in accordance with this section. If Landlord properly delivers such an abatement notice to Tenant, and Tenant does not commence to cure the untenantability caused by the interruption within such one (1) Business Day period from the date of delivery of the notice and complete the cure within ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of the notice, then Landlord will be entitled to an abatement of the payment required by Section 4 of this Amendment (in proportion to the portion of the central station and monitoring center rendered untenantable by the interruption in electrical power) from such tenth (10th) Business Day until such electric power is restored. The abatement will result in a reduction of the credit to the monthly installments of Basic Rent permitted by Section 4 of this Amendment, Tenant will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord against all loss or liability resulting from the failure of Tenant to pay or perform as required by this Section 11.3.</p>
          <p id="s1p1055">11.4 Failure to Operate Cafeteria. In the event Tenant fails to operate the Cafeteria (as such term is defined in Exhibit D attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference) as required by this Amendment for a period of five (5) days after delivery of written notice from Landlord to Tenant, such failure will be deemed an Event of Default under the Lease and Landlord will have the right to pursue and apply any one or more of the remedies available to Landlord under the Lease to that portion of the Demised Premises used by Tenant for the Cafeteria, at Landlord’s sole option.</p>
          <p id="s1p1056">9</p>

          <p id="s1p1058">11.5.1 Holding Over the Reduction Space. In addition, without the delivery of any notice from Landlord to Tenant, if Tenant holds over in the Reduction Space, except for the Suite 350 Data Center, beyond the day immediately preceding the Reduction Effective Date, Tenant will be liable for Basic Rent, Additional Rent and other charges respecting the Reduction Space equal to twice the amount in effect under the Lease prorated on a per diem basis and on a per rentable square foot basis for the Reduction Space. Such holdover amount will not be in limitation of Tenant’s liability for consequential or other damages arising from Tenant’s holding over nor will it be deemed permission for Tenant to holdover in the Reduction Space.</p>
          <p id="s1p1059">11.5.2 Holding Over the Suite 350 Data Center. In addition, without the delivery of any notice from Landlord to Tenant, if Tenant holds over in the Suite 350 Data Center beyond the Termination Date, Tenant will be liable for Basic Rent equal to twice the amount Tenant would pay based on an annual amount per rentable square foot of the Suite 350 Data Center of $12.60 [{(2,131 rsf X $12.60)/365} X 200% = $147.13 per day] plus Additional Rent and other charges respecting the Suite 350 Data Center equal to twice the amount in effect under the Lease prorated on a per diem basis and on a per rentable square foot basis for the Suite 350 Data Center. Such holdover amount will not be in limitation of Tenant’s liability for consequential or other damages arising from Tenant’s holding over nor will it be deemed permission for Tenant to holdover in the Suite 350 Data Center.</p>
          <p id="s1p1060">11.6 Business Days. For purposes of this Amendment, the term “Business Days” means any day other than Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in the State of Minnesota.</p>
          <p id="s1p1061">11.7 Survival. Landlord’s rights and Tenant’s obligations under this section relating to circumstances existing or events occurring prior to and including the Termination Date will survive the Termination Date, regardless of the date of discovery of the failure to enforce such rights or perform such obligations, subject to applicable statutes of limitation.</p>

          <p id="s1p1063">12.1 This Amendment sets forth the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein.

          <p id="s1p1067">12.4 Submission of this Amendment by Landlord is not an offer to enter into this Amendment but rather is a solicitation for such an offer by Tenant. Landlord will not be bound by this Amendment until Landlord has executed and delivered the same to Tenant.</p>
