          <p id="s1p2">LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p3">1. PARTIES</p>
          <p id="s1p4">THIS LEASE is made and entered into effective as of October 17, 2007 (the “Effective Date”), by and between Regan Holding Corp., a California corporation (“Landlord”) and Perot Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Tenant”).</p>
          <p id="s1p5">2. PREMISES</p>
          <p id="s1p6">Landlord hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant leases from Landlord, approximately 37,060 rentable square feet as described and set forth in Exhibit “A” attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (the “Premises”), comprising all of that certain one-story building located at 25 Legacy Drive NW, Rome, GA 30165 (the “Center”), and the land under and around the Center (the “Property”) being legally described in Exhibit “B” (“Legal Description”) attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Landlord represents that the Premises has been measured in accordance with the Standard Method for Measuring Floor Area in Office Buildings, ANSI/BOMA Z65.1-1996. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, the square footage of the Premises may be adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in the amount of common area in the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p7">3. TERM</p>
          <p id="s1p8">(a)</p>
          <p id="s1p9">Tenant shall have and hold said Premises for a term of ten (10) years (as the same may be extended hereunder, the “Term”) upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease. The “Commencement Date” of the Term of this Lease shall be the Effective Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p10">(b)</p>
          <p id="s1p11">Tenant is hereby granted one (1) option to renew this Lease with respect to all (but not less than all) of the Premises for five (5) years, beginning at the end of the initial ten year term (the “Renewal Term”) by notice in writing delivered to Landlord not less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then current term of this Lease. All of the covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease shall be applicable to the Renewal Term, except that the Rent shall be as determined under Section 3(c) below. Tenant's exercise of the foregoing option to renew is subject to the conditions that (i) this Lease is in full force and effect, (ii) Tenant is not in default hereunder beyond any applicable notice or cure period at the time of notification or at commencement of the Renewal Term, and (iii) Tenant has not assigned this Lease (other than as permitted under Section 6 below). In the event that Tenant exercises the renewal option set forth herein, Tenant and Landlord agree to enter into an amendment to this Lease incorporating the Renewal Term and the monthly Rent applicable thereto within thirty (30) days following the exercise of the renewal option, but in no event shall a delay in the full execution of such amendment nullify Tenant's exercise of the option to renew.</p>
          <p id="s1p12">(c)</p>
          <p id="s1p13">If Tenant exercises its option for a Renewal Term under Section 3(b) above, the Rent for such Renewal Term shall be the then current “Market Rental Rate” for the Premises as of the date the Renewal Term is to commence. For purposes of this Lease, &quot;Market Rental Rate&quot; shall mean the rental, as of the date for which such Market Rental Rate is being calculated, per rentable square foot, for lease renewals for comparable space of comparable size, that Landlord is offering or prepared to offer for renewals in good faith at that time to third parties for a similar term for such other space in the Center or if no other comparable space is available in the Center, then for comparable space in other comparable buildings in the applicable office submarket, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Landlord shall advise Tenant of such Market Rental Rate for the Renewal Term within fifteen (15) days after a written request therefore from Tenant; provided however that Tenant’s failure to timely make such request shall not extend the date upon which Tenant must give notice of its exercise of the option to renew under Section 3(b).</p>
          <p id="s1p14">4. RENT</p>
          <p id="s1p15">During the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord in advance, on or before the 1 st day of each and every month as Rent the amount stated below. Rental payments shall commence on the Commencement Date. Rental payments shall be paid at the address of the Landlord set forth above, or at such other address as the Landlord may specify in writing from time to time during the Term of this Lease. If the Rent is not received by Landlord on or before the tenth (10th) business day following the day of the month on which the Rent is due, a late payment charge of five percent (5%) of such past due amount (&quot;Late Payment Charge&quot;) shall become due and payable. Any monetary amount due Landlord hereunder, other than Late Payment Charges, not received by Landlord within thirty (30) days following the date on which it was due, shall bear interest from the thirty-first (31st) day afte r it was due at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum, but not exceeding the maximum rate allowed by law (the “Default Rate”), in addition to the Late Payment Charge provided for herein.</p>

          <p id="s1p74">Tenant shall have the right to assign this Lease or sublet all or any part of the Premises with the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. However, Landlord reserves the right to deny its consent to such assignment or sublet which, in Landlord’s reasonable determination, would negatively affect the tenant mix of the Center (if Tenant no longer leases all of the leasable space therein) or for a use which is not authorized by the provisions of Article 5 of this Lease. Notwithstanding the above, Tenant may assign its entire interest under this Lease or sublet the Premises to (i) any entity controlling or controlled by or under common control with Tenant or (ii) any successor to Tenant by purchase, merger, consolidation or reorganization without the consent of Landlord provided that Tenant gives Landlord written notice prior to the effectiv e date of such assignment or sublease.

          <p id="s1p77">3</p>
          <p id="s1p78">(c)</p>
          <p id="s1p79">During the term of this Lease, should Landlord sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey its interest in the Premises and/or Center, Landlord shall be released by Tenant from all covenants and obligations of Landlord under this Lease for events arising after the effective date of such conveyance. In such event, Tenant agrees to recognize any such transferee as Landlord under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p80">8. REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENTS</p>
          <p id="s1p81">(a)</p>
          <p id="s1p82">Tenant Repairs and Maintenance. Except as provided in Section 8(b), Tenant shall maintain, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, the Premises and the Center in a clean, safe, and operable condition, and shall not permit or allow to remain any waste or damage to any portion of the Premises. Without limiting the foregoing, Tenant shall (1) maintain the interior walls and the interior surfaces of exterior walls (including painting and other treatment thereof), doors, door closure devices, window and door frames, molding, locks and hardware, floors, floor coverings and ceiling, (2) maintain, repair and replace all plate and other glass, (3) furnish, maintain and replace all electric lights, and (4) maintain and repair all plumbing and electrical systems and all equipment (including all air heating, conditioning, and ventilating [“HVAC”]equipment) and fixtures on the Premises or the Center, in each case , in good operating order and condition and in accordance with applicable laws. Landlord shall give written notice to the Tenant of any repairs or maintenance required hereunder, and if the Tenant does not complete the same within fifteen (15) days after said notice (or such longer period as is required to make a repair or maintenance which by its nature cannot be completed in such fifteen (15) day period so long as Tenant commences the repair or maintenance within fifteen (15) days and diligently prosecutes the same to completion), Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to complete such repair or maintenance and recover its cost by collecting the same from Tenant as additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">(b)</p>
          <p id="s1p84">Landlord Repairs and Replacements. Landlord shall, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, be responsible for the following: any repairs or replacement required to the structural components of the building of the Center, including but not limited to the foundation and exterior walls; any replacement required of the roof, floors, HVAC equipment, or utility mains of the Center; any repaving of the parking lot or other paved portions of the Property; or any single repair or related series of repairs of any of the foregoing that would cost more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00). Tenant shall give written notice to the Landlord of any repair or replacement required hereunder, and if the Landlord does not complete the same within fifteen (15) days after said notice (or such longer period as is required to make a repair or replacement which by its nature cannot be completed in such fifteen (15) day period so long as Landlord commences the repair or replacement within fifteen (15) days and diligently prosecutes the same to completion), Tenant shall have the right, but not the obligation, to complete such repair or replacement and recover its cost by offsetting such cost against the Rent payable to Landlord. If a repair or replacement required to be made by Landlord under this section Landlord has a material adverse impact on the business of Tenant as conducted in the Premises (to the point that it renders the Premises in a condition that is unsuitable for conducting the normal business of Tenant therein) (i) and such repair or replacement is not completed with seven (7) days after written notice from Tenant, the Rent shall abate until such repair or replacement is completed, (ii) and such repair or replacement is not completed with sixty (60) days after written notice from Tenant, Tenant shall also have the right to terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord.</p>
