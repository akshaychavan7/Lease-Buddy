Additional Rent</p>
          <p id="s1p203">6. Late Payment Charges. Tenant acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent and other charges provided for under this Lease will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of such costs being extremely difficult or impracticable to fix. Therefore, notwithstanding the notice provision in Paragraph 25.1.1, if any installment of Rent or any other charge due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within five (5) days after the date such Rent or other charge is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum equal to five percent (5%) of the amount overdue as a late charge. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord will incur by reason of the late payment by Tenant.</p>

Tenant may not deliver more than one Review Notice or more than one Objection Notice with respect to any expense year. If Tenant fails to give Landlord a Review Notice before the expiration of the Review Notice Period or fails to give Landlord an Objection Notice before the expiration of the Objection Period, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved the Additional Rent Statement. If Tenant retains an agent to review Landlord’s records, the agent must be with a CPA firm licensed to do business in the State of California and its fees shall not be contingent, in whole or in part, upon the outcome of the review. Tenant shall be responsible for all costs of such review; provided, however, that if Landlord and Tenant determine that the sum of Additional Rent for the year in question was overstated by more than five percent (5%), Landlord, within thirty (30) days shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable amounts paid by Tenant to third parties in connection with such review. The records and any related information obtained from Landlord shall be treated as confidential, and as applicable only to the Premises, by Tenant, its auditors, consultants, and any other parties reviewing the same on behalf of Tenant (collectively, “Objection Notice”).

If, for any expense year, Landlord and Tenant determine that the sum of Tenant’s Percentage of the Actual Expenses, Real Property Taxes and/or Insurance is less or more than the amount reported, Tenant shall receive a credit in the amount of its overpayment, or pay Landlord the amount of its underpayment, against or with the Rent next due hereunder; provided, however, that if this Lease has expired or terminated and Tenant has vacated the Premises, Landlord shall pay Tenant the amount of its overpayment (less any Rent due), or Tenant shall pay Landlord the amount of its underpayment, within thirty (30) days after such determination.</p>

A sale by Landlord to any authority having the power of eminent domain, either under threat of condemnation or while condemnation proceedings are pending, shall be deemed a taking under the power of eminent domain for all purposes of this paragraph. If any part of the Premises is taken and the remaining part is reasonably suitable for Tenant’s continued occupancy for the purposes and uses permitted by this Lease, this Lease shall, as to the part so taken, terminate as of the date that possession of such part of the Premises is taken. If the Premises are so partially taken the Rent and other sums payable hereunder shall be reduced in the same proportion that Tenant’s use and occupancy of the Premises is reduced. If the parties disagree as to the suitability of the Premises for Tenant’s continued occupancy or the amount of any applicable Rent reduction, the matter shall be resolved by arbitration. No award for any partial or entire taking shall be apportioned. Tenant assigns to Landlord its interest in any award which may be made in such taking or condemnation, together with any and all rights of Tenant arising in or to the same or any part thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give Landlord any interest in or require Tenant to assign to Landlord any separate award made to Tenant for the taking of Tenant’s Personal Property, for the interruption of Tenant’s business, or its moving costs, or for the loss of its good will. No temporary taking of the Premises shall terminate this Lease or give Tenant any right to any abatement of Rent except to the extent of interference with Tenant’s use of the Premises and to the extent covered by rent abatement insurance; provided, however, that in any event Rent shall not be abated if Tenant is separately and ,directly compensated for such interference by the condemning authority. Any award made to Tenant by reason of such temporary taking shall belong entirely to Tenant and Landlord shall not be entitled to share therein.
