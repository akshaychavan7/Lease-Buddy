          <p id="s1p33">Except as additional or other agreements may be provided for in numbers 2, 5 and 6 of this lease, the lease shall otherwise be subject to the “General Contract Terms and Conditions of the City of Hamburg for the Leasing of Properties” (AVB in the version of February 2002), which are attached and are part of the present agreement.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">5. Termination</p>
          <p id="s1p35">The agreement shall cease without termination on July 31, 2007 upon expiration of the period agreed under No. 1.</p>
          <p id="s1p36">Termination shall otherwise be governed by the provisions of law and the AVB.</p>
          <p id="s1p37">6. Special contract terms and conditions</p>
          <p id="s1p38">The following is agreed in addition or as a change to the AVB:</p>
          <p id="s1p39">6.1 Lessee has created a structure (parking facility) on the Leased Property on the basis of the lease dated August 12, 1991 as well as the lease amendments dated February 26, 1992, March 22, 1993, November 1, 1994, May 3, 1996 and the lease dated February 18, 1998.</p>
          <p id="s1p40">It is only intended for a temporary purpose within the meaning of § 95 subsection 1 BGB [German Civil Code] and therefore remains the property of Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p41">No compensation is due in the event of an extraordinary termination in accordance with No. 20 AVB.</p>
          <p id="s1p42">6.2 Lessee’s right of termination—as provided in § 549 subsection 1 sentence 2 BGB—in the event that consent to subleasing is not granted (No. 16 AVB) is precluded. However, Lessor will only withhold its consent on important grounds.</p>
          <p id="s1p43">6.3 In the event of a change in ownership or a change in the corporate form on the part of Lessee, No. 16 AVB shall apply accordingly.</p>
          <p id="s1p44">6.4 Upon termination, Lessee shall be required to return the Leased Property in a cleared state. To this end, reference is made to the full content of Item 19 AVB. This notwithstanding, Lessor agrees, however, to assert this claim only to the extent that it is necessary for financial reasons or reasons of expediency in light of an intended or conceivable subsequent use. However, Lessor will not assert any right to re-conversion of access roads or of the sidewalk.</p>
          <p id="s1p45">6.5 Lessee shall maintain the Leased Property including the footpath at its own expense. In the event of a removal, it has no claims whatsoever to reimbursement of expenditures of any kind whatsoever.</p>

          <p id="s1p144">1.2 Unless reference to defects is made in the lease, Lessor is not aware of any defects relating to the property, especially to the subsoil. Any liability for compensation on the part of Lessor according to § 536a subsection 1 BGB is ruled out.</p>

          <p id="s1p146">2.1 Offsets</p>
          <p id="s1p147">Lessee may offset rent only against receivables acknowledged by Lessor or recognized by declaratory judgment. It may not refuse payment of the rent or part thereof by citing a withholding right based on a legal relationship other than the present agreement. In the case of arrears, this applies also to the period after termination of the lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">2.2 Arrears</p>
          <p id="s1p149">If rent is not paid when due, default interest will be charged in an amount of 8 per cent per annum above the relevant base interest rate; if a consumer is party to the legal transaction, the interest rate will be 5 per cent above the relevant base interest rate. The base interest rate in effect when the arrears occur will be applied for the entire default period. An appropriate amount of demand costs may also be billed for every demand notice. Lessee is at liberty to show that no or only immaterial injuries or losses have occurred.</p>
          <p id="s1p150">2.3 Review of rent for leases with a fixed contract period</p>
          <p id="s1p151">The contracting parties have the right to review the appropriateness of the rent agreed for the Leased Property every three years and to agree on a new rent amount. The reference date for the start of the three-year period is the first day of the month in which the lease commences.</p>
          <p id="s1p152">Rent adjustments shall take changes in purchasing power into account that have occurred since the signing of the agreement. They shall be guided in particular by the index for the cost of living of all private households in Germany. The rent agreed at the signing of the contract shall, in any event, be the minimum rent.</p>

          <p id="s1p171">7.1 Lessee is required to maintain the Leased Property including the buildings, installations and access roads included in the lease or belonging to it at its own expense in a proper condition that ensures traffic safety.
