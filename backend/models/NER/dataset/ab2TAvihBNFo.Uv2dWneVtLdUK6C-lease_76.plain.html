Not more frequently than every five years, if, in the opinion of Landlord’s lender or of an insurance broker retained by Landlord, the amount of public liability and property damage insurance coverage at that time is not adequate, Tenant shall increase the insurance coverage as reasonably required by either Landlord’s lender or Landlord’s insurance broker.</p>
          <p id="s1p72">E. Waiver of Subrogation.

          <p id="s1p98">19. Surrender of Lease. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant, accepted by Landlord, or the mutual cancellation of this Lease, shall not work a merger and shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate all or any existing subleases or subtenancies or operate as an assignment to Landlord of any or all of such subleases or subtenancies.</p>
          <p id="s1p99">20. Holding Over. Any holding over after the expiration of the Term of this Lease without the consent of Landlord shall be construed to be a tenancy from month-to-month at a rent equal to the rent payable if this Lease were still in force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p100">21. Grace Period.</p>
          <p id="s1p101">A. No default or breach of any of the covenants and conditions of this Lease shall exist on the part of Landlord or Tenant until the party claiming default or breach shall serve upon the other a written notice, as provided in this Lease, specifying with particularity the covenant or condition of which the party is alleged to be in default, and that the other party has failed to perform or observe such covenant or condition, as the case may be, within 10 days after the serving of such notice on it.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">B. In the event, however, that any penalty be incurred or created or interest be charged by reason of lapse of time due to the failure or omission of such party to have performed or observed such covenant or condition, then the party shall bear and pay such penalty or discharge such interest as additional rental under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p103">C. The above grace period shall not apply to rent payments or other payments required of Tenant under this Lease, the time of such payments being of the essence of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">D. If either party shall be delayed or prevented from the performance of any act required by this Lease by reason of natural disaster, strikes, lockouts, labor troubles, inability to procure materials, restrictive laws, or other cause, without fault and beyond the reasonable control of the party obligated (financial inability excepted), performance of such act shall be extended for a period equivalent to the period of such delay, provided, however, that nothing in this section shall excuse Tenant from the prompt payment of any rent or other charge required of Tenant except as may be expressly provided elsewhere in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p105">22. Landlord’s Remedies upon Default. Landlord shall have the following remedies if Tenant commits a default. These remedies are not exclusive but are in addition to any remedies now or later allowed by law.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">A. Landlord shall have the right either to terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises and thus terminate this Lease or to have this Lease continue in full force and effect with Tenant at all times having the right to possession of the Premises. Should Landlord elect to terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises and terminate this Lease, then Landlord</p>
          <p id="s1p107">10</p>
          <p id="s1p108">shall have the immediate right of entry and may remove all persons and property from the Premises. The property so removed may be stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost and for the account of Tenant. Upon such termination, Landlord, in addition to any other rights and remedies, shall be entitled to recover from Tenant the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the Term of this Lease after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Tenant could have reasonably avoided. The worth at the time of award of the amount referred to in this Section shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City at the time of the award plus 2%. Prior to such award, Landlord may re-let the Premises for the purpose of mitigating damages suffered by Landlord because of Tenant’s failure to perform Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">B. Any proof of Tenant of the amount of rent loss that could have reasonably been avoided shall be made in the following manner: Landlord and Tenant shall each select a licensed real estate broker in the business of renting property of the same type and use as the Premises and in the same geographic vicinity. The two real estate brokers shall select a third licensed real estate broker, and the three licensed real estate brokers so selected shall determine the amount of rent loss that could have been reasonably avoided for the balance of the Term of this Lease after the time of award. The decision of the majority of the licensed real estate brokers shall be final and binding upon the parties to this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">C. As used in this Lease, the term “time of award” shall mean either the date upon which Tenant pays to Landlord the amount recoverable by Landlord as set forth in this Lease or the date of entry of any determination, order, or judgment of any court, or other legally constituted body, or any arbitrators determining the amount recoverable, whichever occurs first.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">D. Should Landlord, following any breach or default of this Lease by Tenant, elect to keep this Lease in full force and effect, for so long as Landlord does not terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises (in spite of the fact that Tenant may have abandoned the Premises), then Landlord, in addition to all other rights and remedies that Landlord may have at law or in equity, shall have the right to enforce all of Landlord’s rights and remedies under this Lease. In spite of any such election to have this Lease remain in full force and effect, Landlord may at any later time elect to terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises and thus terminate this Lease for any previous breach or default which remains uncured, or for any subsequent breach or default. For the purposes of Landlord’s right to continue this Lease in effect upon Tenant’s breach or default, Landlord’s acts to maintain or preserve the Premises, or to re-let them, or to seek the appointment of a receiver to protect its interest under this Lease shall not constitute a termination of Tenant’s right to possession.</p>
          <p id="s1p112">E. In the event Landlord elects, upon breach or default of this Lease by Tenant, to keep this Lease in full force and effect, Landlord may, as attorney-in-fact of Tenant, from time to time sublet the Premises or any part of it for such Term and at such rent and upon such other terms as Landlord in Landlord’s sole discretion may deem advisable. Upon each such subletting, (1) Tenant shall be immediately liable to pay to Landlord, in addition to indebtedness other than rent due under this Lease, the cost of such subletting and any reasonably necessary alterations and repairs, incurred by Landlord, and the amount by which the rent under this Lease for the period of such subletting (to the extent such period does not exceed the Term of this Lease)</p>
          <p id="s1p113">11</p>
          <p id="s1p114">exceeds the amount agreed to be paid as rent for the Premises for the period of subletting, or (2) at the option of Landlord, rents received from the subletting shall be applied: first, to payment of indebtedness other than rent due under this Lease from Tenant to Landlord; second, to the payment of costs of the subletting and of any reasonably necessary alterations and repairs; third, to payment of rent due and unpaid under this Lease; and the residue, if any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future rents as they become due under this Lease. If Tenant has been credited with any rent to be received by the subletting under option (1) and the rent has not been promptly paid to Landlord by the subtenant, or if the rent received from the subletting under option (2) during any month is less than that to be paid during that month by Tenant under this Lease, then Tenant shall pay any such deficiency to Landlord. The deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly. No taking possession of the Premises by Landlord, as attorney-in-fact for Tenant, shall be construed as an election on its part to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such intention is given to Tenant. In spite of any such subletting without termination, Landlord may at any later time elect to terminate this Lease for such previous breach. At Landlord’s option and application, a receiver for Tenant shall be appointed to take possession of the Premises and to exercise Landlord’s right to sublet the Premises as attorney-in-fact for Tenant and to apply any rent collected from the Premises as provided in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p115">F. Nothing in this section affects the right of Landlord to indemnification for liability arising prior to the termination of this Lease for personal injuries or property damage where this Lease provides for such indemnification.</p>
          <p id="s1p116">G. If Tenant shall be in default in the performance of any covenant to be performed under this Lease, then, after notice and without waiving or releasing Tenant from the performance of the covenant, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, perform any such covenant, and in exercising any such right pay necessary and incidental costs and expenses in connection with it. All sums so paid by Landlord, together with interest on it at the maximum rate of interest per annum allowed by law, shall be deemed additional rental and shall be payable to Landlord on the next rent-paying day.</p>
          <p id="s1p117">H. Rent not paid when due shall bear interest at the maximum rate of interest per annum allowed by law from the date due until paid.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">23. Attorney Fees on Default. If either Landlord or Tenant shall obtain legal counsel or bring an action against the other by reason of the breach of any covenant, warranty, or condition of this Lease or otherwise arising out of this Lease, the unsuccessful party shall pay to the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees, which shall be payable whether or not such action is prosecuted to judgment. The term “prevailing party” shall include, but not be limited to, a party who obtains legal counsel or brings an action against the other by reason of the other’s breach or default and obtains substantially the relief sought whether by compromise, settlement, or judgment.</p>
          <p id="s1p119">24. Insolvency. The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute a breach of this Lease by Tenant and a default under this agreement: (1) the appointment of a receiver to take possession of all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant; (2) a general assignment by Tenant for the benefit of creditors; or (3) any action taken or suffered by Tenant under any insolvency or bankruptcy act.</p>
          <p id="s1p120">12</p>
          <p id="s1p121">25. Assignment or Subletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">A. Tenant shall not assign this Lease or any interest in it and shall not sublet the Premises or any part of it or any right or privilege appurtenant to this Lease or permit any other person (the agents and employees of Tenant excepted) to occupy or use the Premises or any portion of it without first receiving the written consent of Landlord. Landlord agrees not to unreasonably withhold such consent but may in lieu of granting consent terminate this Lease. A consent to one assignment, subletting, or occupation and use by another person shall not be deemed to be a consent to any other or further assignment, subletting, or occupation nor a waiver of the provisions of this Section, except as to the specific instance covered by it. Any such assignment, subletting, or occupation without consent shall be void and shall at the option of Landlord terminate this Lease. This Lease and any interest in it shall not be assignable as to the interest of Tenant by operation of law without the written consent of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">B. In the event Tenant contemplates an action under Section 26, Paragraph A, Tenant shall give Landlord 30 days’ written notice of Tenant’s intention to sublease or assign this Lease. Such notice shall constitute an offer by Tenant to Landlord to terminate this Lease and the future rights and obligations of the parties under this Lease. Landlord may accept the offer by giving written notice of acceptance to Tenant within 10 days of Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s notice of intention to sublet or assign. Upon such acceptance, this Lease shall terminate as of the end of the calendar month in which the notice of acceptance is given to Tenant. Tenant shall then surrender the Premises to Landlord and the provisions of this Lease applicable to termination upon expiration of the Term shall apply. Such termination shall not relieve either party from liability for any breach or default occurring prior to termination.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">C. Tenant shall have the right in the event of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or recapitalization, whether or not Tenant survives as the surviving corporation, to assign or transfer this Lease to such surviving corporation. In the event Tenant contemplates making an assignment or transfer as provided in this Section 26, Paragraph C, Tenant shall give 30 days’ notice to Landlord of its intent to make the assignment or transfer and shall furnish to Landlord all pertinent information as to the book value of the proposed assignee. Upon assignment or transfer, as provided in this section, the liability of Tenant shall terminate and Landlord shall look to the assignee for performance under this Lease, provided the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Lease as though an original signatory.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">D. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease, Tenant shall remain fully liable on this Lease and shall not be released from performing any of the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease unless Landlord consents.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">E. Tenant immediately and irrevocably assigns to Landlord, as security for Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, all rent from any subletting of all or a part of the Premises as permitted by this Lease. Landlord, as assignee and as attorney-in-fact for Tenant, or a receiver for Tenant appointed on Landlord’s application, may collect such rent and apply it toward Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, except that, until the occurrence of an act of default by Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to collect such rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p127">13</p>
          <p id="s1p128">F. In no event shall Tenant assign this Lease or sublet the Premises, or any portion of it, to any then-existing or prospective Tenant of the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p129">G. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord the sum of $500 to reimburse Landlord for all expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by Landlord in connection with any requested and reasonably permitted assignment or subleasing. Such sum shall be in addition to any other attorney fees and costs allowed under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p130">26. Transfer by Landlord; Release from Liability. In the event Landlord shall sell or transfer the Building or any part of it and as a part of such transaction shall assign its interest as Landlord in and to this Lease, then from the effective date of such sale, assignment, or transfer Landlord shall have no further liability under this Lease to Tenant except as to any matters of liability that have accrued and are unsatisfied as of such date, it being intended that the covenants and obligations contained in this Lease on the part of Landlord shall be binding upon Landlord and its successors and assigns only during their respective periods of ownership of the fee or leasehold estate, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">27. Damage to or Destruction of Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">A. In the event of a partial destruction of the Premises from any cause covered by Landlord’s standard fire and extended coverage insurance, Landlord shall immediately repair such destruction provided the cost of repair does not exceed the insurance proceeds and such repairs can be made within 60 days. However, partial destruction shall in no way annul or void this Lease, but Tenant shall be entitled to a proportionate reduction of rent while repairs are being made. If partial destruction was caused by any risk not covered by Landlord’s insurance, or if the cost of repair exceeds the insurance proceeds payable, Landlord may, at its option, make such repairs, provided the repairs can be made within 60 days, and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">B. If Landlord does not elect to make repairs, it is not obligated to make, or if repairs cannot be made within days, or if repairs cannot be made under law, this Lease may be terminated at the option of either party.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">C. In the event the Building is destroyed to the extent of not less than 50% of the replacement cost of it, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease, whether the Premises are injured or not and without liability to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">D. A total destruction of the Premises, or of the Building, shall terminate this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p136">E. In the event of any dispute between Landlord and Tenant relative to the provisions of this Section, they shall submit their dispute to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be final and binding upon both Landlord and Tenant, and the cost of the arbitration shall be borne equally between them.</p>
          <p id="s1p137">14</p>
          <p id="s1p138">28. Eminent Domain.</p>
          <p id="s1p139">A. If all or any part of the Premises shall be taken or appropriated by any public or quasi-public authority under the power of eminent domain, either party to this Lease shall have the right, at its option, to terminate this Lease upon notice given within 30 days after the date of such taking or appropriation.</p>
          <p id="s1p140">B. If all or any part of the Building shall be taken or appropriated by any public or quasi-public authority under any power of eminent domain, Landlord may terminate this Lease upon notice given within 30 days after the date of such taking or appropriation.</p>
          <p id="s1p141">C. In either of the above-stated events, Landlord shall be entitled to, and Tenant upon demand of Landlord shall assign to Landlord, any rights of Tenant to any and all income, rent, award, or any interest whatsoever that may be paid or made in connection with such public or quasi-public use or purpose, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for the value of any unexpired Term of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p142">D. If a part of the Premises shall be so taken or appropriated and neither party to this agreement shall elect to terminate the Lease, the rent subsequently to be paid shall be equitably reduced.</p>
          <p id="s1p143">29. Subordination to Mortgages and Deeds of Trust. This Lease shall be subject and subordinate at all times to all ground and underlying Leases that may now exist or subsequently be executed affecting the Building and/or the Land and to the lien of any encumbrance in any amount or amounts whatsoever now or subsequently placed on or against the Building and/or Land or on or against any ground or underlying Lease without the necessity of having further instruments on the part of Tenant to effectuate such subordination. In spite of the above, Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver upon demand such further instruments evidencing such subordination of this Lease to such ground or underlying Leases and to the lien of any such encumbrance as may be required by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p144">30. Effect of Exercise of or Failure to Exercise Rights by Landlord. Neither the exercise of nor failure to exercise any right, option, or privilege under this Lease by Landlord shall exclude Landlord from exercising any and all other rights, options, or privileges under this Lease, nor shall such exercise or non-exercise relieve Tenant from Tenant’s obligation to perform each and every covenant and condition to be performed by Tenant under this Lease, or from damages or other remedy for failure to perform or meet the obligations of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">31. Waiver.</p>
          <p id="s1p146">A. The waiver by Landlord of any breach of any term, covenant, or condition contained in this Lease shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant, or condition, or of any subsequent breach of such term, covenant, or condition, or of any other term, covenant, or condition in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">B. The acceptance of rent under this Lease by Landlord shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by Tenant of any term, covenant, or condition of this Lease other than Tenant’s breach in failing to pay the particular rent so accepted, regardless of Landlord’s knowledge of such additional preceding breach at the time of the acceptance of rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">15</p>
          <p id="s1p149">32. Notices. All notices to be given to Tenant may be given in writing personally or by depositing the notices in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed: if to Tenant, at Tenant’s notice address as set forth in Section 1, Paragraph A, Subparagraph (7) or at such other place or places as Tenant may from time to time designate in writing; if to Landlord, at Landlord’s notice address as set forth in Section 1, Paragraph A, Subparagraph (8), or at such other place or places as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing.</p>
          <p id="s1p150">33. Representations. This Lease represents the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the parties’ rights and duties under it. Tenant acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any agent, servant, or representative of Landlord, or any person purporting to act on Landlord’s behalf, has made any representation, warranty, or statement with respect to the amount of taxes that may or will be assessed against the Premises or about the cost of any insurance required to be secured by Tenant under this Lease or any other matter relating to this Lease that is not expressly covered in this Lease. With respect to such matters, Tenant is relying upon Tenant’s own independent investigation and sources of information, and Tenant expressly waives any right Tenant might otherwise have under the law to rescind this Lease or to claim damages by reason of the fact that such taxes or assessments or costs of insurance may be in excess of any sum deemed reasonable by Tenant, or in excess of any amount Tenant anticipated paying under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p151">34. Notice of Surrender or Termination. At least 60 days before the last day of the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall give to Landlord a written notice of intention to surrender the Premises on that date, but nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed as an extension of the Term or as consent of Landlord to any holding over by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p152">35. Execution. Submission of this instrument for examination or signature by Tenant does not constitute a reservation of or option for lease, and it is not effective as a Lease or otherwise until execution and delivery by both Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p153">36. Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence of this Lease and each and all of its provisions.</p>
          <p id="s1p154">37. Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Lease contains all the agreements of the parties with respect to the subject matter and cannot be amended or modified except by a written agreement.</p>
          <p id="s1p155">38. Negation of Partnership. Landlord shall not become or be deemed a partner or a joint venturer with Tenant by reason of the provisions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p156">39. Provisions are Covenants and Conditions. All provisions, whether stated as covenants or conditions, on the part of Tenant shall be deemed to be both covenants and conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p157">40. Use of Definitions. The definitions contained at the beginning of and in the text of this Lease shall be used to interpret this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p158">16</p>
          <p id="s1p159">41. Severability. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision of this Lease shall not render the other provisions invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.</p>
          <p id="s1p160">42. Captions. The headings of the sections of this Lease are descriptive and for convenience only, are not a part of this Lease, and shall have no effect on the construction or interpretation of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p161">43. Successors. The provisions of this Lease will, subject to the provisions as to assignment, apply to and bind the heirs, successors, administrators, and executors of the parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p162">44. Applicable Law. This Lease will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas.</p>
          <p id="s1p163">45. Counterparts. This Lease may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will constitute but one and the same instrument.</p>
          <p id="s1p164">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party to this Lease has caused it to be executed on the date indicated below.</p>
