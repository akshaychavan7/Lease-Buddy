          <p id="s1p103">(a) Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3, Landlord will (i) purchase the Land, (ii) design, construct and install the Cold Shell on the Land, (iii) install the</p>
          <p id="s1p104">5</p>
          <p id="s1p105">Leasehold Improvements and (iv) relocate Tenant from its existing facility in Northglenn, Colorado to the Premises. Landlord shall bear the costs for such activities up to a total of , which costs shall include, but shall not be limited to, funds expended for all Land, design, planning, development, governmental approvals and/or permits, construction and relocation costs. To the extent the total cost for such activities exceeds (including costs attributable to Change Orders), then such amount shall be &quot;Tenant's Cost'' and Tenant shall pay Landlord such additional amount within twenty (20) days after receipt of Landlord's invoice. In the event the total cost for such activities is less than , Tenant shall not be entitled to any credit. The parties agree to work together so that this project can be completed promptly and in the most cost-efficient manner possible.</p>

          <p id="s1p107">(c) Landlord will use reasonable efforts to cause Landlord's Work to be Substantially Completed by the Projected Commencement Date and will continually advise Tenant during the construction process of any changes in the anticipated Commencement Date. In any event, Landlord will give Tenant at least 60 Business Days' prior notice of the occurrence of the Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">3.2 Delivery of Possession. If Landlord is unable to deliver possession of the Premises with the Landlord's Work Substantially Completed by the Projected Commencement Date, then, except as provided below, Landlord will not be in default or liable in damages to Tenant, nor will the obligations of Tenant be affected, provided, however, that the Commencement Date will be extended automatically by one day for each day of the period after the Projected Commencement Date to the day on which Landlord tenders possession of the Premises to Tenant with Landlord's Work Substantially Completed, less any portion of that period attributable to Tenant's delays as more particularly described in Section 3.12.. Such postponement of the commencement of the Term will be in full settlement of all claims that Tenant might otherwise have against Landlord by reason of Landlord's failure to have Substantially Completed its obligations by the Projected Commencement Date. If Landlord delivers possession of the Premises with the Landlord's Work Substantially Completed prior to the Projected Commencement Date, then Tenant may either accept such delivery (in which case such date will be the Commencement Date hereunder) or may refuse to accept delivery until any date selected by Tenant that is no later than the Projected Commencement Date. For purposes of the foregoing, any occupation of the Premises by Tenant for fixturing or similar purposes after Landlord's Work has been Substantially Completed will be deemed acceptance of the Premises. The term &quot;Substantially Completed&quot; means that the Premises are broom clean, free of construction tools and materials, and Landlord's Work has been completed according to the Cold Shell Plans and the Leasehold Improvements Plans with only minor punch list items that will not materially interfere with Tenant's use and enjoyment of the Premises remaining to be completed or corrected pursuant to Section 3.3; that an unconditional certificate of occupancy for the Premises has been issued and not suspended or revoked or amended in a manner that would prevent Tenant from occupying the Premises the</p>

Within 60 days after the Commencement Date, Landlord will provide to Tenant a complete set of as-built drawings of Landlord's Work and manuals for all equipment incorporated into the Improvements as a part of Landlord's Work. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 3.2 to the contrary, if, by August 15, 2002, Landlord has not delivered possession of the Premises to Tenant with Landlord's Work Substantially Completed, then Tenant may refuse to accept delivery until a date chosen by Tenant after January 2003 and the Lease shall not commence until such date. Nevertheless, in determining such date, Tenant shall choose the earliest date practicable for Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">3.3 Punch List. Tenant's taking possession of any portion of the Premises will be conclusive evidence that such portion of the Premises was in good order and satisfactory condition, and that all of Landlord's Work in or to such portion of the Premises was satisfactorily completed, when Tenant took possession, except as to any patent defects or uncompleted items identified on a punch list prepared and signed by Landlord's Representative and Tenant's Representative after an inspection of the Premises by both such parties made at the time Tenant takes possession, and except as to any latent defects in Landlord's Work of which Tenant notifies Landlord within one year after the Commencement Date.

Either party may change its representative at any time by three days' prior written notice to the other party.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">3.5 Design Information. Tenant will cooperate with Landlord and submit all information necessary for preparation of the Cold Shell Plans and the Leasehold Improvements Plans (the &quot;Design Information&quot;).</p>
          <p id="s1p114">3.6 Cold Shell Plans.

          <p id="s1p116">3.7 Cold Shell Construction. At such time as Cold Shell Plans that have been approved in writing by both Landlord and Tenant have been prepared, Landlord cause the Cold Shell to be constructed or installed on the Land in a good and workmanlike manner and according to the approved Cold Shell Plans and all applicable Laws. Landlord will on a monthly basis provide Tenant with a summary of the actual funds expended to date (based on monthly payment applications submitted by the builder in accordance with the construction contract) compared to the estimated costs for construction of the Cold Shell</p>
          <p id="s1p117">3.8 Leasehold Improvements Plans. Promptly after receipt of all Design Information, Landlord will cause its architect to prepare the Leasehold Improvements Plans based on the submitted Design Information. Landlord will notify Tenant at least five (5) Business Days of the date on which Tenant will receive the Leasehold Improvement Plans. Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the proposed Leasehold Improvements Plans, together with a cost estimate for the construction of the Leasehold Improvements, Tenant will either approve the same in writing or notify Landlord in writing of how the proposed Leasehold Improvements Plans are inconsistent with the Design Information and how the Leasehold Improvements Plans must be changed in order to make them consistent with the Design Information. Each Business Day following the 5th Business Day after the proposed Leasehold Improvements Plans are submitted to Tenant until Tenant approves them or delivers such notice of objections will be a day of Tenant's delay. Upon receipt of Tenant's notice of objections, Landlord will cause its architect to prepare revised Leasehold Improvements Plans according to such notice and submit the revised Leasehold Improvements Plans, together with a revised c.ost estimate for the construction of the Leasehold Improvements, to Tenant. Upon submittal to Tenant of the revised Leasehold Improvements Plans, and upon submittal of any further revisions, the procedures described above will be repeated. If the original Leasehold Improvements Plans, or any revisions thereof, are consistent with the Design Information, then each Business Day following Landlord's receipt of Tenant's notice of any objections until the day on which Landlord receives Tenant's written approval of the Leasehold Improvements Plans will be a day of Tenant's delay. Despite any provision of this Section 3.8, Tenant will not be deemed to have caused a delay if it is unable to respond to proposed Leasehold Improvements Plans because of the condition or absence of the Cold Shell Plans; however, Tenant will promptly advise Landlord of its inability to respond to the Leasehold Improvements Plans for that reason.</p>

During the Term, Tenant may, in its sole discretion, remove or replace any of the personal property, equipment, trade fixtures or movable partitions owned by Tenant and placed or installed in the Premises at Tenant's expense. Subject to Section 10.1, Tenant may also remove or replace the Leasehold Improvements. Landlord warrants that the Leasehold Improvements will be free of all defects indesign, materials or construction for a period of one year from the date Landlord's Work is Substantially Completed. Landlord will on a monthly basis provide Tenant with a summary of the actual funds expended to date (based on monthly payment applications submitted by the builder in accordance with the construction contract) compared to the estimated costs for construction of the Leasehold Improvements.</p>

If Tenant fails to approve such Change Order within 10 Business Days after delivery by Landlord, Tenant will be deemed to have withdrawn the proposed change and Landlord will not proceed to perform the change. Upon Landlord's receipt of Tenant's approval, Landlord will proceed to perform the change. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 3.1, Tenant will pay for any approved Change Order within twenty (20) days after receipt of Landlord's invoice.</p>

The aggregate Tenant delays described in this Section 3.12 will be reduced by the number of days deducted from the construction schedule on account of Change Orders requested by Tenant. As a condition to claiming a delay by Tenant, Landlord will advise Tenant of the circumstances giving rise to the claim within 10 Business Days after they arise and will advise Tenant of the cost that Tenant can pay at that time to effect any available remedy to eliminate such delay (such as, e.g., overtime work).</p>

So long as Tenant complies with the terms of this Section 5.4, Tenant will have the right, in connection with any such contest, at its sole expense, to institute and prosecute, in good faith and with due diligence and in Landlord's name if necessary, any appropriate proceedings, and Landlord will, at Tenant's expense, fully cooperate with Tenant's efforts to contest any such Taxes or special assessments.</p>

In the event of Tenant's challenge or contest of such Law, Tenant may elect not to comply with such Law during such challenge or contest; provided, however, that such election not to comply will not result in any material risk of forfeiture of Landlord's interest in the Premises.

If Tenant fails to discharge any such lien within such period, then, in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord, after 10 days prior written notice to Tenant, Landlord may, but will not be obligated to, discharge the same by paying to the claimant the amount claimed to be due or by procuring the discharge of such lien as to the Premises by deposit in the court having jurisdiction of such lien, the foreclosure thereof or other proceedings with respect thereto, of a cash sum sufficient to secure the discharge of the same, or by the deposit of a bond or other security with such court sufficient in form, content and amount to procure the discharge of such lien, or in such other manner as is now or may in the future be provided by present or future Laws for the discharge of such lien as a lien against the Premises. Any amount paid by Landlord, or the value of any deposit so made by Landlord, together with all costs, fees and expenses in connection therewith (including reasonable attorney's fees of Landlord), together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate, will be repaid by Tenant to Landlord on demand by Landlord and if unpaid may be treated as Additional Rent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant desires to contest any such lien, Tenant may do so provided that, within 10 days after Tenant learns of the filing thereof, Tenant notifies Landlord of Tenant's intention to do so and, until such time as Tenant causes such lien to be removed by the payment thereof or by bonding over such lien in the manner provided by law, posting with Landlord such security as Landlord may reasonably request to provide funds with which Landlord may discharge such lien in the event Tenant is unsuccessful in its contest and then fails to discharge such lien. Tenant will indemnify and defend Landlord against and save Landlord and the Premises harmless from all losses, costs, damages, expenses, liabilities, suits, penalties, claims, demands and obligations, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees resulting from the assertion, filing, foreclosure or other legal proceedings with respect to any such mechanic's lien or other lien.</p>

Consent by Landlord to any assignment of this Lease or to any subletting of the Premises will not be a waiver of Landlord's rights under this section as to any subsequent assignment or subletting. Any sale, assignment, mortgage, transfer or subletting of this Lease which is not in compliance with the provisions of this Section 11 will be of no effect and void. Landlord's right to assign its interest in this Lease will remain unqualified.
