          <p id="s1p227">2. TERM:</p>
          <p id="s1p228">The Premises are leased for a term to commence on the Commencement Date, and to end at 12:00 midnight on the Expiration Date, all as defined in the Preamble.</p>
          <p id="s1p229">3. FIXED BASIC RENT:</p>
          <p id="s1p230">The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor during the Term commencing on the Rent Commencement Date or Additional Premises Rent Commencement Date, as the case may be, the Fixed Basic Rent as defined in the Preamble (hereinafter called “Fixed Basic Rent”) payable in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. The Fixed Basic Rent shall accrue at the rate set forth in the Rent Rider attached hereto and made a part hereof and shall be payable, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month during the Term at the Monthly Installments as defined in the Preamble, except that a proportionately lesser sum may be paid for the first month of the Term of this Lease if the Term commences on a day other than the first day of the month, in accordance with the provisions of this Lease herein set forth.

The Lessee shall not use or occupy or permit the Premises to be used or occupied, nor do or permit anything to be done in or on the Building Area, in a manner which will in any way violate any certificate of occupancy affecting the Premises unless Lessee shall, at its own cost and expense, obtain such amendments to the existing certificate of occupancy or as required to permit such other use.</p>
          <p id="s1p235">In addition to the foregoing, Lessee shall have the exclusive right to utilize the helipad located at the Property, provided that such use is in accordance with all laws and requirements of governmental authorities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee’s share of the cost of capital expenditures with respect to the roof only shall not exceed in the aggregate $350,000.00.</p>
          <p id="s1p244">Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the waste water treatment system requires a modification, alteration, repair or replacement to comply with any change in any law or requirement of governmental or quasi-governmental authority, then the cost of such modification, alteration, repair or replacement shall be shared by Lessor and Lessee as follows: Lessor shall bear sixty-six and 67/100 percent (66.67%) of the cost and Lessee shall bear thirty-three and 33/100 percent (33.33%) of the cost.

          <p id="s1p268">(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section 8, neither this Lease, nor the Term and estate hereby granted, nor any part thereof, nor the interest of Lessee in any sublease or the rental thereunder, shall be assigned, mortgaged, pledged, encumbered or otherwise transferred by Lessee or Lessee’s legal representatives or successors in interest, by operation of law or otherwise, and neither the Premises, nor any part thereof, nor any Lessee’s Property, shall be encumbered in any manner by reason of any act or omission on the part of Lessee or anyone claiming under or through Lessee, or shall be sublet or be used or occupied or permitted to be used or occupied or utilized for desk or storage space by anyone other than Lessee or for any purpose other than as specifically permitted by this Lease, without the prior written consent of Lessor, which in the case of assignment or subletting, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.</p>
          <p id="s1p269">11</p>
          <p id="s1p270">In the event Lessee desires to assign this Lease or sublease all or part of the Premises to any other party, the terms and conditions of such assignment or sublease shall be communicated to the Lessor in writing prior to the effective date of any such sublease or assignment, solely with respect to any sublease or assignment, which its terms, including any options to renew, covers that remainder of the Term or expires within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the Expiration Date, prior to such effective date, the Lessor shall have the option, exercisable in writing to the Lessee, to: (i) recapture in the case of subletting, that portion of the Premises to be sublet or all of the Premises in the case of an assignment (“Recapture Space”) so that such prospective sublessee or assignee shall then become the sole Lessee of Lessor hereunder, or (ii) recapture the Recapture Space for Lessor’s own use and the within Lessee shall be fully released from any and all obligations hereunder with respect to the Recapture Space.</p>

In either event, Lessor may apply the net amount collected to the rents herein reserved, but no such assignment, subletting, occupancy or collection shall be deemed a waiver of any of the provisions of Section 8(a) above, or the acceptance of the assignee, sublessee or occupant as tenant, or a release of Lessee from the further performance by Lessee of Lessee’s obligations under this Lease. The consent by Lessor to an assignment, mortgaging or subletting pursuant to any provision of this Lease shall not in any way be considered to relieve Lessee from obtaining the express consent of Lessor for any other or further assignment, mortgaging or subletting. References in this Lease to use or occupancy by anyone other than Lessee shall not be construed as limited to sublessees and those claiming under or through sublessees but as including also licensees and others claiming under or through Lessee, immediately or remotely. The listing of any name other than that of Lessee on any door of the Premises or on any sign on the Premises, or otherwise, shall not operate to vest in the person so named any right or interest in this Lease or in the Premises, or be deemed to constitute, or serve as a substitute for, any prior consent of Lessor required under this Section, and it is understood that any such listing shall constitute a privilege extended by Lessor which shall be revocable at Lessor’s will by notice to Lessee. Lessee agrees to pay to Lessor any reasonable counsel fees incurred by Lessor in connection with any proposed assignment of Lessee’s interest in this Lease or any proposed subletting of the Premises or any part thereof, if Lessor’s consent thereto is required. Neither any assignment of Lessee’s interest in this Lease nor any subletting, occupancy or use of the Premises or any part thereof by any person other than Lessee as provided in this Article, nor any application of any such rent as provided in this Article shall, under any circumstances, relieve Lessee herein named of its obligations fully to observe and perform the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease on Lessee’s part to be observed and performed.</p>
          <p id="s1p272">12</p>
          <p id="s1p273">Lessor, however, shall not in any event be obligated to consent to the assignment of this Lease unless: (i) in the reasonable judgment of Lessor the proposed assignee is of a character and financial worth such as is in keeping with the standards of Lessor in those respects for the Premises, or the assignee can otherwise secure and guaranty the payment to Lessor of all Fixed Basic Rent and Additional Rent and any other amounts due from Lessee pursuant to this Lease in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Lessor; (ii) the nature of the proposed assignee’s business and its reputation are in keeping with the character of the Premises and the use thereof; (iii) the purpose for which the proposed assignee intends to use the Premises assigned to it are uses expressly permitted by and not expressly prohibited by this Lease; (iv) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (v) Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for all reasonable costs that may be incurred by Lessor in connection with the said assignment, including the costs of making investigations as to the acceptability of a proposed assignee and legal costs incurred in connection with the granting of any requested consent.</p>

If Lessor denies Lessee’s request for consent to a specific subletting or assignment, Lessor shall specify in writing, the reason(s) therefor. If Lessor fails to respond within such ten (10) business day period, Lessee may send Lessor a second notice which notice shall provide in capitalized and bold type letters that Lessor’s failure to respond to such request within five (5) business days shall be deemed Lessor’s consent to such subletting or assignment, and if Lessor fails to respond to such request within five (5) business days after Lessor’s receipt of such second notice, Lessor shall be deemed to have consented to such subletting or assignment. Lessor, however, shall not in any event be obligated to consent to the proposed sublease for which Lessor’s consent is required or the commencement of the term unless: (i) in the reasonable judgment of Lessor the proposed subtenant is of a character and financial worth such as is in keeping with the standards of Lessor in those respects for the Premises, and the nature of the proposed subtenant’s business and its reputation are in keeping with the character of the Premises and the use thereof; (ii) the purpose for which the proposed subtenant or assignee intends to use the portion of the Premises sublet or assigned to it are uses expressly permitted by and not</p>

          <p id="s1p278">(3) With respect to each and every subletting authorized by the provisions of this Section it is further agreed and understood between Lessor and Lessee that: (i) the subletting shall be, and each such sublease shall expressly provide that is, subject and subordinate at all times and in all respects, to this Lease, (ii) no subletting shall be for a term ending later than one day prior to the Expiration Date originally provided for herein and that part, if any, of the proposed term of any sublease which shall extend beyond a date one day prior to the Expiration Date originally provided for herein (or any sooner date of the expiration of the term or termination of this Lease) is hereby deemed to be a nullity and (iii) there shall be delivered to Lessor, within ten (10) days after the commencement of the term of the proposed sublease, notice of such commencement and a fully executed copy of the proposed sublease (unless previously submitted).</p>
          <p id="s1p279">(4) Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, Lessee shall not advertise but may list its space for subletting or assignment, at a rental rate lower than the rental rate then being paid by Lessee to Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p280">(d) No assignment or sublet of any portion or all of the Premises shall be valid unless Lessee shall have first provided to Lessor: (i) a duplicate original of the assignment or subletting document; (ii) an instrument in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor signed executed by the assignee in which assignee shall expressly assume observance and performance of, and agreed to be personally bound by, all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease which are to be performed or observed by Lessee following the effective date of the assignment. No assignment or sublet of any portion or all of the Premises shall be deemed or act as a release of Lessee from the performance by Lessee of Lessee’s obligations under this Lease. Lessee’s liability shall be joint and several with any successors (immediate or remote) in interest of Lessee and such joint and several liability in respect of Lessee’s obligations hereunder shall not be discharged, released or impaired in any respect by any agreement or stipulation made by Lessor modifying any of the obligations or terms of this Lease, or by any waiver or failure of Lessor to enforce any of the obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p281">(e) If Lessee is a corporation other than a corporation whose stock is listed and traded on a nationally recognized stock exchange, the provisions of Section a shall apply to a transfer (however accomplished, whether in a single transaction or in a series of related or unrelated transactions) of stock (or any other mechanism such as, by way of example, the issuance of additional stock, a stock voting agreement or change in class(es) of stock) which results in a change of “control” (as hereinafter</p>
          <p id="s1p282">14</p>
          <p id="s1p283">defined) of Lessee as if such transfer of stock (or other mechanism) which results in a change of control of Lessee were an assignment of this Lease, and if Lessee is a partnership or joint venture, said provisions shall apply with respect to a transfer (by one or more transfers) of an interest in the distributions of profits and losses of such partnership or joint venture (or other mechanism, such as, by way of example, the creation of additional general partnership or limited partnership interests) which results in a change of control of such a partnership or joint venture, as if such transfer of an interest in the distributions of profits and losses of such partnership or joint venture which results in a change of control of such partnership or joint venture were an assignment of this Lease. The provisions of clauses (a) and (b) of this Article shall not apply to transactions entered into by Lessee with: (i) a Lessee Affiliate (as hereinafter defined); or (ii) a corporation into or with which Lessee is merged or consolidated, or with an entity to which all or substantially all of Lessee’s business/assets are transferred or to any sale of all or substantially all of Lessee’s stock, or a transfer of all or substantially all of partnership or membership interests, provided (a) there has not been an Event of Default under this Lease, (b) in the case of clause (ii) above, such merger, consolidation or transfer of business/assets, sale of stock or transfer of partnership or membership interests is for a legitimate business purpose and not principally for the purpose of transferring the leasehold estate created hereby, and (c) in the case of clause (ii) above, the assignee or successor entity has a net worth as evidenced by financial statements delivered to Lessor and certified by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices consistently applied (“Net Worth”) after such merger, consolidation or acquisition and assumption equal to or greater than ONE HUNDRED MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($100,000,000.00) and a credit rating of at least BBB with a positive outlook (or an equivalent shadow rating). Lessee shall deliver to Lessor proof reasonably satisfactory as to Lessee’s Net Worth and credit rating within ten (10) days prior to the effective date of the transaction. In determining the Net Worth of the assignee or successor for purposes of this Section, Lessee may, at its option, include the Net Worth of any surviving predecessor Lessee continuing to have liability on or under this Lease and/or any guarantor of Lessee’s obligations under this Lease. A “Lessee Affiliate” or “Affiliate of Lessee” means a corporation or other entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with Lessee. As used in this Lease, the terms “control”, “controlled by” or “under common control with” shall mean ownership of (x) more than forty percent (40%) of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation (or other majority equity and control interest if not a corporation), and (y) the possession of power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policy of such corporation or other entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by statute or according to the provisions of a contract. Lessee may sublet all or any portion of the Premises or assign this Lease to an Affiliate of Lessee without Lessor’s consent or recapture rights, provided that Lessee shall continue to be liable under this Lease.</p>

Lessee acknowledges that the rules and regulations attached as Exhibit B are applicable while Lessee is the sole tenant in the Building. At such time(s) that Lessee is not the sole tenant in the Building, Lessor may prescribe such reasonable rules and regulations that Lessor deems necessary. The Rules and Regulations shall be prescribed and enforced in a non-discriminatory manner. Lessee shall not place a load upon any floor of the Premises exceeding the floor load which it was designed to carry and which is allowed by law.

The Fixed Basic Rent and Additional Rent shall be abated proportionately to the extent that the Premises shall have been rendered Untenantable (as hereinafter defined) or inaccessible, such abatement to be from the date of such damage or destruction to the date which is thirty (30) days following the date the Premises shall no longer be Untenantable or inaccessible. “Untenantable” shall mean actual inability to use space in the Premises for the purposes permitted by Article 4.</p>
          <p id="s1p298">(b) (1) If the Building shall be totally damaged or the whole or material part of the Building shall be rendered Untenantable by fire or other casualty and the estimate referred to in Section 8(b)(2) exceeds twelve (12) months, then and in such events Lessor may, at its option, terminate this Lease and the Term and estate hereby granted by giving Lessee not less than thirty (30) days, nor more than sixty (60) days, notice of such termination, within ninety (90) days after the date of such damage. In the event that such notice of termination shall be given, this Lease and the Term and estate hereby granted shall terminate as of the date provided in such notice of termination (whether or not the Term shall have commenced) with the same effect as if that were the Expiration Date, and the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent shall be apportioned as of such date of sooner termination, and any prepaid portion of Fixed Rent and Additional Rent for any period after such date shall be refunded by Lessor to Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p299">(2) If the Building or any material part of the Building shall be damaged or Untenantable or inaccessible by fire or other casualty, Lessor shall deliver to Lessee, within ninety (90) days after such fire or other casualty, the estimate of a reputable architect or general contractor of the time necessary to complete the required repairs and restore and rebuild the Building to the level of demising walls or to provide access. If such estimate exceeds twelve (12) months from the date of such casualty, or if Lessor fails to deliver such notice, then in such events, Lessee may serve on Lessor, within thirty (30) days of its receipt of Lessor’s notice or the expiration of ninety (90) days from the fire or casualty, as the case may be (time being of the essence with respect thereto), notice of its intention to terminate this Lease on a date which shall be not more than ninety (90) days from the date of Lessee’s notice.

Should Lessee neglect, fail, or refuse to remove its aforesaid property within fifteen (15) days after Lessor’s request, the provisions for abatement of Fixed Basic Rent contained herein shall be suspended and of no force and effect whatsoever until Lessee has completed such removal. In no event shall the Lessor be required to repair or replace Lessee’s merchandise, trade fixtures, furniture, furnishings, inventory and equipment.</p>

If (i) all of the Premises are taken in a condemnation, or (ii) a portion of the Premises are taken in condemnation and Lessee determines in good faith that it will be economically unfeasible to operate its business in any facility that could be reconstructed on the remaining portion of the Premises, this Lease will terminate and all obligations under it will cease as of the date upon which possession is taken by the condemnor. Upon such termination, the Fixed Basic Rent and Additional Rent will be apportioned and paid in full by Lessee to Lessor to that date, all Fixed Basic Rent and Additional Rent prepaid beyond that date will be repaid by Lessor to Lessee, and Lessee will comply with subsection (e). lf, after a partial condemnation of the Premises, Lessee remains in possession of the remaining portion of the Premises after the date on which the condemnor takes possession of the portion of the Premises taken in condemnation, then Lessee shall be deemed a holdover tenant pursuant to Article 25 hereof for such period commencing thirty (30) days after the date upon which the condemnor took possession of the condemned portion of the Premises. If Lessor disputes any determination by Lessee that it will be economically unfeasible to operate its business in any facility that could be reconstructed on the remaining portion of the Premises, upon request of either party, the matter will be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) at the office of the AAA nearest the Building.(a) Termination</p>
          <p id="s1p310">(b) . If there is a partial condemnation and this Lease has not been terminated pursuant to subsection (a), Lessor will promptly restore the Building and other improvements on the Property to a condition and size as nearly comparable as reasonably possible to their condition and size immediately prior to the taking; the time of restoration will be extended for time lost due to Force Majeure, provided that Lessor diligently pursues such restoration during such Force Majeure period. Lessor shall retain the proceeds of any condemnation award recovered. In that event, there will be an equitable abatement of the Fixed Basic Rent and Additional Rent, commencing from and after the date on which the condemnor takes possession.Partial Condemnation</p>
          <p id="s1p311">(c) . If a condemnation affecting Lessee occurs, Lessee will have the right to make a claim against the condemnor for removal expenses, business dislocation damages and moving expenses to the extent that such claims or payments do not reduce the sums payable by the condemnor to Lessor. Lessee waives all claims against Lessor and all other claims against the condemnor, and Lessee assigns to Lessor all claims against the condemnor including, without limitation, all claims for leasehold damages and diminution in value of Lessee’s leasehold.Award</p>

If the Premises or any part thereof be reset by Lessor for the unexpired portion of the Term, or any part thereof, before presentation of proof of such liquidated damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the amount of rent reserved upon such reletting shall be deemed prima facie to be the fair and reasonable rental value for the part or the whole of the Premises so relet during the term of the reletting. Nothing herein contained shall limit or prejudice the right of the Lessor to prove for and obtain as damages by reason of such termination an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in which, such damages are to be proved, whether or not such amount be greater or less than the</p>

          <p id="s1p345">amount of liquidated damages referred to above (due account to be taken, however, of the amounts, if any, collected under this Section 13).</p>
          <p id="s1p346">(g) In no event shall Lessee be entitled to receive any excess of the rental and other income collected by Lessor in respect of the Premises over the sums payable by Lessee to Lessor hereunder. In no event shall Lessee be entitled in any suit for the collection of damages pursuant to this Section to a credit in respect of any such rental and other income, except to the extent that such rental and other income is allocable to the portion of the Term in respect of which such suit is brought and is actually received by Lessor prior to the entry of judgment in such suit.</p>
          <p id="s1p347">(h) Separate actions may be maintained by Lessor against Lessee from time to time to recover any damages which, at the commencement of any such action, have then or theretofore become due and payable to Lessor under Section, without waiting until the end of the Term and without prejudice to Lessor’s right to collect damages thereafter.</p>
          <p id="s1p348">14. Intentionally Omitted.</p>
          <p id="s1p349">15. SUBORDINATION OF LEASE:</p>
          <p id="s1p350">This Lease shall, at Lessor’s option, or at the option of any holder of any underlying lease or holder of any mortgage or trust deed (hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as “Senior Encumbrances”), be subject and subordinate to any such underlying leases and to any such mortgage or trust deed which may now or hereafter affect the real property of which the Premises form a part, and also to all renewals, modifications, consolidations and replacements of said underlying leases and said first mortgage or trust deed, provided that Lessor shall obtain a customary, commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement from the holder of any such underlying lease, mortgage or trust deed. Lessor shall cause to be included in such non-disturbance agreement a provision that recognizes Lessor’s obligation to apply insurance proceeds toward restoration of the Building and the Premises and does not otherwise alter any of the terms of this Lease. Any expenses charged by the mortgagee in connection with the obtaining of the aforesaid agreement shall be paid by Lessor. Although no instrument or act on the part of Lessee shall be necessary to effectuate such subordination, Lessee will, nevertheless, execute and deliver such further commercially reasonable instruments confirming such subordination of this Lease as may be desired by the holders of said mortgage or trust deed or by any of the Lessor’s under such underlying leases. If any underlying lease to which this Lease is subject terminates, Lessee shall, on timely request, attorn to the owner of the reversion.</p>
          <p id="s1p351">16. SECURITY DEPOSIT:</p>
          <p id="s1p352">Lessee shall deposit with Lessor on or before March 17, 2005, , the Security Deposit as defined in the Preamble for the full and faithful performance of Lessee’s obligations under this Lease, including without limitation, the surrender of possession of the Premises to Lesser as herein provided. If Lessor appliesTIME BEING OF THE ESSENCE</p>
          <p id="s1p353">25</p>
          <p id="s1p354">any part of said Security Deposit to cure any default of Lessee, Lessee shall, on demand, deposit with Lessor the amount so applied so that Lessor shall have the full Security Deposit on hand at all times during the Term of this Lease. In the event a bona fide sale, subject to this Lease, Lessor shall have the right to transfer the Security Deposit to the vendee, and Lessor shall be considered released by Lessee from all liability for the return of the Security Deposit; and Lessee agrees to look solely to the new lessor for the return of the Security Deposit, and it is agreed that this shall apply to every transfer or assignment made of the Security Deposit to the new lessor. Provided this Lease is not in default, the Security Deposit (less any portions thereof used, applied or retained by Lessor in accordance with the provisions of this Article 16), shall be returned to Lessee after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and after delivery of the entire Premises to Lessor in accordance with the provisions of this Lease. Lessee covenants that it will not assign or encumber or attempt to assign or encumber the Security Deposit and Lessor shall not be bound by any such assignment, encumbrance or attempt thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p355">In the event of the insolvency of Lessee, or in the event of the entry of a judgement in any court against Lessee which is not discharged within thirty (30) days after entry, or in the event a petition is filed by or against Lessee under any chapter of the bankruptcy laws of the State of New Jersey or the United States of America, then in such event, Lessor may require the Lessee to deposit additional security in an amount which in Lessor’s sole judgement would be sufficient to adequately assure Lessee’s performance of all of its obligations under this Lease including all payments subsequently accruing. Failure of Lessee to deposit the security required by this Article 16 within ten (10) days after Lessor’s written demand shall constitute a material breach of this Lease by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p356">17. RIGHT TO CURE LESSEE’S/LESSOR’S BREACH:</p>
          <p id="s1p357">(a) If Lessee breaches any covenant or condition of this Lease, Lessor may, on thirty (30) days notice to Lessee (except that in case of emergency a lessor notice appropriate to the circumstances shall be required), cure such breach at the expense of Lessee and the actual and reasonable amount of all expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by Lessor in so doing shall be deemed Additional Rent payable on demand.</p>
          <p id="s1p358">(b) If (i) Lessor fails to perform any of its obligations under this Lease (other than by reason of Lessee’s acts or omissions or Force Majeure), which failure (A) materially interferes with Lessee’s use of the Premises for the conduct of its business and (B) Lessor fails to commence to remedy such failure to perform within ten (10) business days from the date Lessee notifies Lessor of such failure and (ii) in the case of any such failure (A) Lessee again notifies Lessor after the expiration of such ten (10) business day period of such failure and of Lessee’s intention to cure same, which notice shall specify that such notice is being given in accordance with this Article 17, and shall contain the following statement in capitalized bold type: and (B) such“IF YOU FAIL TO PERFORM THE OBLIGATION REFERENCED IN THIS NOTICE WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 17 OF THE LEASE, WE SHALL EXERCISE OUR SELF-HELP REMEDIES UNDER THAT SECTION”</p>
          <p id="s1p359">26</p>
          <p id="s1p360">failure continues for not less than five (5) consecutive days from the date Lessor receives such second notice, provided that, in the case of a failure which for causes beyond Lessor’s reasonable control cannot with due diligence be cured with such 5-day period, such 5-day period shall be extended for such period as may be necessary to cure such failure provided that Lessor shall be diligently prosecuting such cure, then at Lessee’s election and as Lessee’s sole remedy (if Lessee elects to exercise its self-help rights hereunder), Lessee may take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to cure such failure. Lessor shall reimburse Lessee for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Lessee in performing same within ten (10) business days after receipt by Lessor of a written statement from Lessee as to the amount of such costs, provided the performance of such obligation by Lessee does not adversely affect the structure, electrical, HVAC, plumbing or mechanical systems of the Building. The amount reimbursed (excluding Excess Costs, hereinafter defined) by Lessor shall be included in Operating Costs; provided, however, if the cost incurred by Lessee in exercising its self-help right hereunder shall exceed the amount that Lessor would have incurred and which would have been included in Operating Costs had Lessor performed its obligations, then such excess amount (“Excess Costs”) shall not be included in Operating Costs and the Excess Costs shall be borne solely by Lessor. If Lessor fails to reimburse Lessee for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Lessee hereunder, then the costs shall not be included in Operating Costs and Lessee shall have the right to offset the Excess Costs against the management fee(s) thereafter coming due Lessor under this Lease. Such offset amount shall include interest at the Interest Rate from the date of the expenditure to the date Lessee shall be actually or effectively, i.e., through offset of the management fee(s) reimbursed by Lessor. Lessee shall provide Lessor with reasonable evidence of the cost of such work performed by Lessee hereunder. For purposes hereof, Lessor shall be deemed to have commenced to cure a failure or service interruption if Lessor has begun to take such action as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances (e.g., inspecting the situation, calling necessary contractors, etc.), even thought actual repairs may not have commenced. In the exercise of Lessee’s rights under this Section 17(b), Lessee agrees that Lessee shall use only those contractors then on the approved list of contractors for the Building, as such list may be furnished from time to time during the Term by Lessor to Lessee. In the event Lessee exercises the self-help remedies in accordance with this Section 17(b), Lessee hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, pay on behalf of and hold harmless Lessor and its respective partners, joint venturers, directors, officers, invitees, agents, servants and employees (each, an “indemnitee” for purposes of this provision) from and against any loss, damage, liability, cost, claim or expense (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) arising from or in connection with Lessee’s negligence or willful misconduct in the exercise of such self-help remedies, including, without limitation, any accident, injury or damage whatsoever occurring in, about or to the Building or the structure, electrical, HVAC, plumbing or mechanical systems of the Building as a result of Lessee’s performance of its self-help remedies under this Section 17(b). In no event shall Lessee have any rights under this Section</p>

          <p id="s1p362">if the failure or service interruption was caused by Force Majeure or any act, omission, negligence or willful misconduct of Lessee or any of its contractors, agents, employees, servants, licensees or invitees or if Lessee is in default under this Lease beyond applicable notice and grace periods.17(b)</p>
          <p id="s1p363">(c) If Lessee exercises any of its self-help rights under this Article 17, Lessee shall not be entitled to any rent abatement under Article 21 hereof in respect of the occurrence in question other than any rent abatement which may have accrued prior to Lessee exercising such self-help rights.</p>
          <p id="s1p364">18. MECHANIC’S LIENS:</p>
          <p id="s1p365">Lessee shall, within thirty (30) days after notice from Lessor, discharge or satisfy by bonding or otherwise any mechanic liens for materials or labor claimed to have been furnished to the Premises on Lessee’s direction. If Lessee shall fail to cause such lien to be discharged within the period aforesaid, then, in addition to any other right or remedy, Lessor may, but shall not be obligated to, discharge the same by bonding proceedings, if permitted by law (and if not so permitted, by deposit in court). Any amount so paid by Lessor, including all costs and expenses paid by Lessor in connection therewith shall constitute Additional Rent payable by Lessee under this Lease and shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor on demand.</p>
          <p id="s1p366">19. RIGHT TO INSPECT AND REPAIR:</p>
          <p id="s1p367">Lessor may enter the Premises at any reasonable time on reasonable notice to Lessee (except that no notice need be given in case of emergency) provided that a representative of Lessee is present (provided that Lessee shall make such representative available to Lessor) for the purpose of inspection or the making of structural repairs, replacements or additions in, to, on and about the Premises or the Building, or such other repairs, replacements or additions as required by this Lease or required to safeguard the Building or Property. Lessee shall have no claims or cause of action against Lessor by reason thereof. When performing work within the Premises, Lessor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize interference with Lessee’s use and occupancy of the Premises. In no event shall Lessee have any claim against Lessor for interruption of Lessee’s business, however occurring, including but not limited to that arising from the negligence of Lessor, its agents, servants or invitees, or from defects, errors or omissions in the construction or design of the Premises and/or the Building, including the structural and non-structural portions thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p368">20. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY LESSOR/LESSOR’S EXCULPATION:</p>
          <p id="s1p369">Subject to intervening laws, ordinances, regulations and executive orders, Lessor agrees as part of Operating Costs, to furnish the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p370">(a) Lessor shall furnish cold water to the Premises for ordinary lavatory, drinking, and office cleaning purposes. Lessor shall install or arrange to have the water company install a water meter at Lessee’s expense which Lessor shall thereafter maintain at Lessee’s reasonable expense unless such maintenance can be</p>
          <p id="s1p371">28</p>
          <p id="s1p372">performed by the water company in which case the water company shall bill Lessee directly for all maintenance expenses and Lessee shall pay for water consumed as shown on said meter at the cost of same charged to Lessor by the water company. Lessor, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, shall furnish rubbish removal services as required and janitorial services and Premises cleaning. Lessor shall maintain and repair, as required, the exterior areas of the Building and, in connection therewith, furnish landscaping and snow removal services and otherwise keep such areas adequately lighted, reasonably clean and in good order, condition and repair, and Lessee shall pay Lessee’s Percentage share thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p373">(b) Lessor shall provide Lessee with conduits, pipes, tubes and wiring for the supply of electricity, gas, water, sewer and telephone service to the point of connection to the Premises. Lessee shall have reasonable access to the utility feeds in the portion of the Additional Premises located in Pod A-1 to perform work in the Building (the “Utility Feed Area”); provided that Lessee shall take reasonable safeguards to minimize interference with the tenant occupying the Utility Feed Area. Lessee shall cooperate with such tenant to minimize such interference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an emergency, Lessor shall provide Lessee with full and unfettered access to the Utility Feed Area and shall include provisions in any sublease of any portion of the Property which confirms such access rights in favor of Lessee. All services other than as provided pursuant to Section a. hereof to be provided to, or which shall be necessary for the conduct of, Lessee’s operations within the Premises, including, without limitation and for purposes of illustration, the furnishing of electric current and gas energy (subject, however, to the provisions of Article 6), telephone, and any other utility or service which Lessee shall deem necessary or desirable, shall be separately arranged, metered, maintained and paid for by Lessee. Lessee’s utilities shall be separately metered, except as otherwise provided in this Lease, and all costs of any utilities not separately metered shall be reasonably apportioned by Lessor and shall constitute Additional Rent. Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, shall cause the Premises to be kept clean and in a good and orderly condition as befits similar buildings in Monmouth County. In the event Lessee shall employ a contractor to provide any services to the Premises, such contractor (and any subcontractors) shall agree to employ only such labor as will not result in jurisdictional disputes or strikes. Lessee shall inform Lessor of the names of any contractor or subcontractor Lessee proposes to use in the Premises at least fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of work by such contractor or subcontractors.</p>
          <p id="s1p374">In addition to the services to be performed by Lessor under this Lease, Lessor, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, shall provide complete management of the Property and Building, excluding providing child care center operations, fitness center, security and food services; it being understood, that Lessee shall contract for such services directly with contractors reasonably acceptable to Lessor and the cost of all such services shall be borne solely by Lessee. All services to be provided by Lessor or at the direction of Lessor shall be awarded to qualified third party service providers who were the low bidders pursuant to a commercially reasonable competitive bidding process. Lessee shall have the right, exercisable</p>
          <p id="s1p375">29</p>
          <p id="s1p376">at Lessee’s reasonable discretion, to disapprove of any service provider and, upon providing notice to Lessor of such disapproval, Lessor shall re-bid the job and promptly retain a replacement service provider pursuant to a commercially reasonable bidding process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee agrees that Lessor shall have the right to engage the services of janitorial contractors using union personnel, although such contractor may not be the lowest bidder; although it will be the lowest bidder of the union janitorial contractors. Lessee shall pay Lessor, as Additional Rent, a management fee in an amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) multiplied by the sum of the following: (i) Fixed Basic Rent; (ii) Additional Rent not reimbursable to Lessee (i.e., such Additional Rent that is not subject to refund to Lessee); and (iii) base building utility cost (which for purposes hereof shall be deemed $1.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises per annum). If Lessor reasonably believes that the base building utility costs exceeds $1.00 per rentable square foot per annum, then Lessor shall cause a survey to be performed by an independent engineer to determine the base building utility cost. If the survey determines that the base building utility cost exceeds $1.00 per rentable square foot per annum, then Lessee shall pay a management fee based upon such determination and Lessee shall pay the cost of the survey. If the survey determines that the base building utility cost does not exceed $1.00 per rentable square foot per annum, then there shall be no adjustment to the management fee and Lessor shall pay the cost of the survey. Such management fee shall be payable in installments in the same manner as the Additional Rent pursuant to Article 23 hereof, mutatis mutandis. The base building utility cost shall mean all utility and energy costs, including any fuel surcharges or adjustments with respect thereto, incurred for electricity, water, sewer, gas and other utilities, not to include the electricity supplied to the lights and outlets of Lessee occupied or to be occupied office space in the Building (as opposed to what would typically be considered “common areas” in a multi-tenanted building).</p>
          <p id="s1p377">(b) Lessee shall provide its own security service at its sole cost and expense. Lessor or any third party tenant may provide security services for such third (3rd) party tenant and the cost thereof shall not be included in Operating Costs. If Lessee fails to provide reasonably adequate security, Lessor shall have the right to do so, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p378">Notwithstanding any provisions of this Lease, Lessor shall not be liable for failure to furnish any of the aforesaid services when such failure is due to Force Majeure, as hereinafter defined. Lessor shall not be liable, under any circumstances, including, but not limited to, that arising from the negligence of Lessor, its agents, servants or invitees, or from defects, errors or omissions in the construction or design of the Premises and/or the Building, including the structural and non-structural portions thereof, for loss of or injury to Lessee or to property, however occurring, through or in connection with or incidental to the furnishings of, or failure to furnish, any of the aforesaid services or for any interruption to Lessee’s business, however occurring. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed</p>
          <p id="s1p379">30</p>
          <p id="s1p380">a waiver of Lessee’s right of constructive eviction if Lessor fails to perform its obligations under this Lease or a waiver of Lessor’s default under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p381">(c) Lessor shall not be liable in damages or otherwise, for any delay or failure in Lessee’s receiving any such utilities from the utility company(ies) and in no event shall such delay or failure, regardless of cost, constitute an eviction of Lessee or termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p382">(d) Access to the Premises is 24 hours per day each day of the year.</p>
          <p id="s1p383">(e) Lessee shall have the right to obtain telecommunications service from such providers as it shall elect. Lessor shall allow such providers to establish and maintain a point of entry in the ground floor of the Building, and Lessor shall not be entitled to charge any fee as a condition to permitting access to the Building or the Premises or for establishing a point of entry in or serving Lessee or any other customers in the Building. Lessee and its service providers shall have the right to install conduits and cables from the Premises into the ground floor of the Building, through the foundation wall, across the Property and to the street or other utility right of way in order to connect with such providers, all in such manner and along such route as Lessor shall reasonably determine; provided, that Lessor may not require Lessee to share any conduit or cable of another occupant or of Lessor, and Lessee shall not be required to share its conduit or cable with another occupant or with Lessor. Any such work to the structure of the Building shall be subject to Lessor’s consent as more fully set forth in Article 6 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p384">21. INTERRUPTION OF SERVICES OR USE:</p>
          <p id="s1p385">Interruption or curtailment of any service maintained in the Building or at the Property, if caused by Force Majeure, as hereinafter defined, shall not entitle Lessee to any claim against Lessor or to any abatement in rent, and shall not constitute a constructive or partial eviction, unless Lessor fails to take measures as may be reasonable under the circumstances to restore the service without undue delay. If the Premises are rendered untenantable in whole or in part, for a period of five (5) consecutive business days or thirty (30) days in any calendar year, by (i) the making of repairs, replacements or additions, other than those made with Lessee’s consent or caused by misuse or neglect by Lessee, or Lessee’s agents, servants, visitors or licensees, (ii) Lessor’s failure to make any repairs or perform any obligation which is Lessor’s responsibility, or (iii) Lessor’s failure to supply any service or utility required to be supplied by Lessor, there shall be a proportionate abatement of Fixed Basic Rent and Additional Rent from and after said fifth (5th) consecutive business day or thirty-first (31st) day in any calendar year and continuing for the period of such untenantability. In no event, shall Lessee be entitled to claim a constructive eviction from the Premises unless Lessee shall first have notified Lessor in writing of the condition or conditions giving rise thereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p386">31</p>
          <p id="s1p387">22. ELECTRICITY/GAS:</p>
          <p id="s1p388">Lessor shall cause electricity and gas to be supplied to the Building and to permit Lessee to receive electricity for Lessee’s use of the Premises, including the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) system. Lessee shall pay for Lessee’s separate supply of electric current and gas energy by direct application to, and arrangement with, the public utility companies servicing the Building. Lessee shall have the right to negotiate with the supplier or suppliers of electricity and gas or require Lessor to obtain electricity and gas from alternate suppliers selected by Lessee. The applicable utility company shall provide such meters used to measure such electricity and gas service. Lessee shall pay all charges with respect to consumption of electricity and gas applicable to the Premises. If, pursuant to a Legal Requirement or the policies or operating practices of the public utility company servicing the Building, Lessee is no longer permitted to obtain electrical energy or gas directly from the public utility company, Lessor will furnish electrical energy and/or gas to the Premises either, at Lessor’s option, on a “check-metering” basis or a rent inclusion basis. Lessor shall give Lessee notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which Lessor shall commence furnishing electrical energy and/or gas to the Premises (unless such notice is not feasible under the circumstances, in which event Lessor will give Lessee such notice as is given to Lessor by the public utility company), which notice will shall confirm Lessor will so furnish electrical energy and/or gas to the Premises at the cost Lessor charged by the public utility company. If any utilities cannot be separately metered or assessed or are only partially separately metered or assessed and are used in common with other lessees of the Building, Lessee will pay to Lessor an equitable apportionment of such charges for utilities used in common with other lessees of the Building, based on the square footage of floor space leased to each lessee using such common facilities, the average electrical or gas consumption of each lessee and other pertinent considerations, in addition to Lessee’s payment of the partially separately metered charges. Lessee shall defend, indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from and reimburse Lessor for all liability, damages, costs, fees, expenses, penalties and charges (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred in connection with (i) Lessee’s failure to pay for any electricity or gas provided to Lessee hereunder or (ii) misuse or neglect by Lessee of the meters(s) and equipment supplying the electricity or gas.</p>
          <p id="s1p389">(a) Lessee’s use of electric current in the Premises shall not exceed the capacity of any electrical conductors and equipment in or otherwise serving the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p390">(b) Lessor shall not be liable in any way to Lessee for any loss, damage or expense which Lessee may sustain or incur as a result of any failure, defect or change in the quantity or character of electrical or gas energy available for redistribution to the Premises pursuant to this Paragraph nor for any interruption in the supply and Lessee agrees that upon reasonable notice (except no notice shall be required in emergencies) such supply may be interrupted for inspection, repairs and replacement and in emergencies. In any event, the full measure of Lessor’s liability for any interruption in the supply due to Lessor’s acts or omissions shall be an abatement of rent and additional rent. In no event shall Lessor be liable for any business interruption suffered by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p391">32</p>
          <p id="s1p392">23. ADDITIONAL RENT:</p>
          <p id="s1p393">It is expressly agreed that Lessee will pay in addition to the fixed Basic Rent provided in Article 3 above, Additional Rent equal to Lessee’s Percentage (as defined in the Preamble) of the cost for each of the categories of expenses set forth in this Article 23.</p>
          <p id="s1p394">For purposes of this Article 23, a “Lease Year” shall mean the Calendar Year, except that the First Lease Year shall commence on the Commencement Date and end on December 31 of such Calendar Year and the Last Lease Year shall end upon the expiration of the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p395">(a) Taxes</p>
          <p id="s1p396">(i) During the Term commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, Lessee shall pay to Lessor as Additional Rent, Lessee’s Percentage, as defined in the Preamble, of all taxes, assessments, general and special, ordinary as well as extraordinary, charges, levies and impositions or payments required to be made in lieu thereof, including, but not limited to, water and sewer rents and charges (collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Taxes”) presently or hereinafter in effect, which are or may be made liens upon or against the Building and the Property and which are allocable to the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p397">(ii) If any Taxes are levied, assessed, or imposed on the Building or the Property or on the income or rents derived therefrom as a substitute, in whole or in part, for the current ad valorem real estate tax, Lessee shall pay the same, measured however, as though the Premises were the sole asset of Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p398">(iii) Commencing on the Rent Commencement Date with respect to the Initial Premises or Additional Premises Rent Commencement Date with respect to the Additional Premises, Lessee shall pay Lessee’s Percentage of Lessor’s estimate of Taxes for the First Lease Year and as set forth in Lessor’s itemized statement for each Lease Year thereafter in equal monthly installments, in advance, as Additional Rent, together with Fixed Basic Rent. Following the expiration of each Lease Year, Lessor shall furnish Lessee with a written statement of the actual Taxes levied against the Building and Property for such Lease Year and Lessee shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Lessor’s statement, pay, as Additional Rent, the deficiency, if any, in Taxes payable by Lessee for such Lease Year; and if, at the end of such Lease Year, the total amount paid by Lessee as Lessee’s Percentage is greater than the actual amount required to be paid for such Lease Year, then the amount of such excess will be applied by Lessor to the next succeeding monthly installment of Fixed Basic Rent due hereunder, and if there is any such excess during the Last Lease Year, then the amount of such excess will be refunded to Lessee by Lessor within ninety (90) days after Lessor’s statement is furnished.

          <p id="s1p547">53</p>
          <p id="s1p548">Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall (i) the Fixed Basic Rent during the First Renewal Term be less than the Fixed Basic Rent during the last year of the initial Term of this Lease and (ii) the Fixed Basic Rent during the Second Renewal Term be less than the Fixed Basic Rent during the last year of the First Renewal Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p549">(f) After the fair market rent has been determined by the appraiser or appraisers and the appraiser or appraisers shall have notified the parties, at the request of either party, both parties shall execute and deliver to each other an amendment of this Lease stating the Fixed Basic Rent for the First Renewal Term or the Second Renewal Term, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p550">(g) If the Fixed Basic Rent for the First Renewal Term has not been agreed to or established prior to the commencement of First Renewal Term, then Lessee shall pay to Lessor an annual rent (“Temporary Rent”) which Temporary Rent shall be equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Fixed Basic Rent payable by Lessee for the last year of the initial Term. If the Fixed Basic Rent for the Second Renewal Term has not been agreed to or established prior to the commencement of Second Renewal Term, then Lessee shall pay to Lessor an annual rent (“Temporary Rent”) which Temporary Rent shall be equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Fixed Basic Rent payable by Lessee for the last year of the First Renewal Term. Thereafter, if the parties shall agree upon a Fixed Basic Rent, or the Fixed Basic Rent shall be established upon the determination of the fair market rent by the appraiser or appraisers, at a rate at variance with the Temporary Rent (i) if such Fixed Basic Rent is greater than the Temporary Rent, Lessee shall promptly pay to Lessor the difference between the Fixed Basic Rent determined by agreement or the appraisal process and the Temporary Rent, or (ii) if such Fixed Basic Rent is less than the Temporary Rent, Lessor shall promptly pay to Lessee to Lessee’s subsequent monthly installments of Fixed Basic Rent the difference between the Temporary Rent and the Fixed Basic Rent determined by agreement or the appraisal process.</p>
          <p id="s1p551">(h) In describing the fair market rent, the appraiser or appraisers shall be required to take into account the rentals at which leases are then being concluded (as of the last day of the initial Term for the First Renewal Term and as of the last day of the First Renewal Term for the Second Renewal Term) (for five (5) year leases without renewal options with the lessor and lessee each acting prudently, with knowledge and for self-interest, and assuming that neither is under undue duress) for comparable space in the Building and in comparable office buildings in the County of Monmouth.</p>
          <p id="s1p552">(i) The option granted to Lessee under this Article 54 may be exercised only by Lessee, its affiliates, permitted successors and assigns, and not by any subtenant or any successor to the interest of Lessee by reason of any action under the Bankruptcy Code, or by any public officer, custodian, receiver, United States Trustee, trustee or liquidator of Lessee or substantially all of Lessee’s property. Lessee shall have no right to exercise this option subsequent to the date Lessor</p>

          <p id="s1p554">shall have the right to give the notice of termination referred to in Article 13 of the Lease unless Lessee cures the default within the applicable grace period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall have no right to extend the term if, at the time it gives notice of its election (i) Lessee shall not be in occupancy of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the Building or (ii) more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Building shall be the subject of a sublease.</p>
          <p id="s1p555">55. SIGNAGE:</p>
          <p id="s1p556">Lessor shall, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, include Lessee’s name and any other names designated by Lessee on the entrance doors to the Building. The Building shall be named for Lessee or, at Lessee’s option, any affiliate of Lessee and a sign to that effect, reasonably acceptable to Lessor and Lessee shall, at Lessee’s option, be placed on the front of the Building and at the vehicular entrance of the Property. The rights of Lessee contained in this Section shall also apply to any subtenant of all or substantially all of the Premises. Except for the signs provided in this Section (a) no other identification signs shall be placed by Lessor outside or on the Building or in the lobby of the Building (other than names on the lessee directory or entrance doors to lessee space) and (b) Lessee shall not place or suffer to be placed or maintain any sign, awning or canopy upon or outside the Premises or in the Building; nor shall Lessee place at the store front any sign, decoration, lettering or advertising matter of any kind without first obtaining Lessor’s written approval and consent in each instance. All signs shall be of a size, color and design as is reasonably approved in writing by Lessor and maintained by Lessor in good condition, repair and appearance at all times, according to Lessor’s standards and the laws of the municipality having jurisdiction over such signs. If Lessor shall deem it necessary to remove any sign in order to paint or to make any repairs, alterations or improvements in or upon the Premises or any part thereof, Lessor shall have the right to do so, provided the same be removed and replaced at Lessor’s cost and expense unless having been occasioned by fault of Lessee. Lessor shall have the right, with or without notice to Lessee, to remove any signs (paper or otherwise) installed by Lessee in violation of this paragraph and to charge Lessee the cost of such removal without liability to Lessee for such removal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Additional Premises Commencement Date, Lessee’s rights hereunder shall only be in effect during such time that Lessee leases at least eighty percent (80%) of the entire Building. At such time that Lessee does not lease at least eighty percent (80%) of the entire Building, Lessor shall promulgate such reasonable signage rules and regulations as Lessor deems necessary.</p>
          <p id="s1p557">56. GENERATOR:</p>
          <p id="s1p558">Lessor acknowledges that Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, may install an emergency generator outside of the Building or on the roof of the Building, the exact location of which to be subject to Lessor’s prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Lessee, at its sole cost, shall be responsible for obtaining any governmental approvals necessary with respect to the installation and operation of the generator. Lessor shall have no obligation to perform any maintenance or repairs with respect to the generator, the cost of which shall be borne solely by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p559">55</p>
          <p id="s1p560">If the generator shall be located on the roof of the Building, the generator shall be properly screened to Lessor’s reasonable satisfaction. Lessor make no representation of the suitability of the roof of the Building for the installation thereof. If Lessor’s structural engineer deems it advisable that there be structural reinforcement of the roof in connection with the installation of the generator, Lessor shall perform same at Lessee’s cost and expense and Lessee shall not perform any such installation prior to the completion of any such structural reinforcement. Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly repair any and all damage to the rooftop or to any other part of the Building caused by the installation, maintenance and repair, operation or removal of the generator. Lessee shall be responsible for all costs and expense for repairs of the roof which result from Lessee’s use of the roof for the construction, installation, maintenance, repair, operation and use of the generator. All installations made by Lessee on the rooftop or in any other part of the Building pursuant to the provisions of this Article 56 shall be at the sole risk of Lessee, and neither Lessor, nor any agent or employee of Lessor, shall be responsible or liable for any injury or damage to, or arising out of, the generator. Lessee’s indemnity under Article 33 shall apply with respect to the installation, maintenance, operations, presence or removal of the generator by Lessee. If the installation of the generator on the rooftop or act or omission relating thereto should revoke, negate or in any material manner impair or limit any roof warranty or guaranty obtained by Lessor, then Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for any loss or damage sustained incurred by Lessor as a result of such impairment or limitation.</p>
