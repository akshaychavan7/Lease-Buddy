          <p id="s1p814">For good and valuable consideration, Tenant and Lender agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p815">1. SUBORDINATION. The Lease and all of the terms, covenants and provisions thereof and all rights, remedies and options of Tenant thereunder are and shall at all times continue to be subject and subordinate in all respects to the terms, covenants and provisions of the Security Instrument and to the lien thereof, including without limitation, all renewals, increases, modifications, spreaders, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof and to all sums secured thereby and advances made thereunder with the same force and effect as if the Security Instrument had been executed, delivered and recorded prior to the execution and delivery of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p816">2. NON-DISTURBANCE. If any action or proceeding is commenced by Lender for the foreclosure of the Security Instrument or the sale of the Property, Tenant shall not be named as a party therein unless such joinder shall be required by law, provided, however, such joinder shall not result in the termination of the Lease or disturb the Tenant’s possession or use of the premises demised thereunder, and the sale of the Property in any such action or proceeding and the exercise by Lender of any of its other rights under the Note or the Security Instrument shall be made subject to all rights of Tenant under the Lease, provided that at the time of the commencement of any such action or proceeding or at the time of any such sale or exercise of any such other rights (a) the Lease shall be in full force and effect and (b) Tenant shall not be in default beyond any applicable cure periods under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Lease or of this Agreement on Tenant’s part to be observed or performed.</p>

          <p id="s1p821">5. NOTICE TO LENDER AND RIGHT TO CURE. Tenant shall notify Lender of any default by Landlord under the Lease and agrees that, notwithstanding any provisions of the Lease to the contrary, no notice of cancellation thereof or of an abatement shall be effective unless Lender shall have received notice of default giving rise to such cancellation or abatement and shall have failed within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice to cure such default, or if such default cannot be cured within sixty (60) days, shall have failed within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice to commence and thereafter diligently pursue any action necessary to cure such default.
