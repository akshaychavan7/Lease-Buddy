If at any time any person representing Tenant shall not be cooperative or shall otherwise cause or threaten to cause any such disharmony or interference, and Tenant fails to promptly institute and maintain corrective actions, then Landlord may revoke Tenants entry rights upon not less than one business days prior written notice to Tenant. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that any such entry into and occupancy of the Premises or any portion thereof by Tenant or any person or entity working for or on behalf of Tenant shall be deemed to be subject to all of the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of the Lease applicable to any such construction or other fit-up work to be performed on the Premises, excluding only the covenant to pay rent (until the occurrence of the Commencement Date, or upon such earlier date as Tenant may commence business operations within the Premises). Tenant further acknowledges and agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for any injury, loss or damage which may occur to any of Tenants work made in or about the Premises in connection with such entry or to any property placed therein prior to the Commencement Date, the same being at Tenants sole risk and liability. Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for any damage to any portion of the Premises caused by Tenant or any of Tenants employees, agents, contractors, consultants, workmen, mechanics, suppliers and invitees, provided that if and to the extent such damage is covered by insurance required to be carried by Landlord or the contractors completing the work under this Lease (such as course of construction coverage), Tenant shall pay any amounts in excess of the amount of insurance proceeds actually received by Landlord with respect thereto. In addition, subject to the insurance, indemnity and waiver of subrogation provision of this Lease, Tenant shall hold Landlord harmless from and indemnify, protect and defend Landlord against any loss or damage to the Building or Premises and against injury to any persons caused by Tenants entry or work during the Early Access Period.</p>

          <p id="s1p191">(a) Monthly Base Rent. Upon execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum of $360,181.32 constituting Monthly Base Rent ($312,445.00) and estimated Operating Expenses ($47,736.32, calculated at the estimated rate of $0.29 per rentable square foot of the Building per month) due and payable by Tenant for the first (1st) full calendar month of the Term for which such amounts are payable hereunder. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord the Monthly Base Rent for the Premises set forth in Section 1(i) above in advance on the first (1st) day of each calendar month during the Term without prior notice or demand, plus all applicable rental taxes, including, without limitation, occupancy, transaction privilege and excise taxes on the rent payable by Tenant hereunder, if any. As set forth in Section 3(a) above, if the Term of this Lease commences or ends on a day other than the first (1st) day of a calendar month, then the rent (as defined below) for such period will be prorated in the proportion that the number of days this Lease is in effect during such period bears to the number of days in such month. All rent must be paid to Landlord without any deduction or offset (except as herein specifically provided for), in lawful money of the United States of America, at the address set forth in Section 1(a) above, or to such other person or at such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">(b) Additional Rent. In addition to the payment of Monthly Base Rent, Tenant shall pay all Operating Expenses applicable to the Building, late charges, and any other sums due and payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease, and the word rent as used in this Lease will include all such additional rent unless the context specifically or clearly implies that only Monthly Base Rent is intended. This Lease is what is commonly called a Triple-Net Lease, it being understood that, except where and to extent that Monthly Base Rent is waived by Landlord pursuant to the terms of Section 4(d) of this Lease, Landlord shall receive the Monthly Base Rent set forth in Section 4(a) in addition to, the Operating Expenses and other amounts due and payable by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease.</p>

In the event of a default by Tenant under the terms of this Lease that results in termination of this Lease in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 hereof, then as a part of the recovery set forth in Section 21 of this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to the recovery of the unamortized amount of the Monthly Base Rent that was abated under the provisions of this Section 4 (based upon the amortization of the abated Monthly Base Rent in equal monthly amounts, without interest, during the period commencing on the Commencement Date and ending on the original Expiration Date).</p>
          <p id="s1p202">5. OPERATING EXPENSES.</p>
          <p id="s1p203">(a) Operating Expenses. In addition to Monthly Base Rent, throughout the Term of this Lease, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord as additional rent in accordance with the terms of this Section 5, the Operating Expenses as defined in this Section 5(a). As used in this Lease, Operating Expenses means only: (i) Real Property Taxes (as defined in Section 11(b) of this Lease); (ii) any and all assessments imposed with respect to the Premises pursuant to any recorded covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting the Premises as of the Effective Date (it being understood that Tenant shall have no obligation to pay any increase in Operating Expenses resulting from any new or change in any covenants, conditions or restrictions affecting the Premises recorded after the Effective Date unless and to the extent imposed upon Landlord or the Property without any voluntary act of, or permission granted by, Landlord); (iii) costs of insurance premiums carried by Landlord pursuant to Section 18 of this Lease; and (iv) a management fee in an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the Monthly Base Rent payable with respect to the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p204">(b) Estimate Statement. Prior to the Commencement Date and as soon as practical following the start of each subsequent calendar year during the Term of this Lease, Landlord will endeavor to deliver to Tenant a statement (Estimate Statement) wherein Landlord will reasonably estimate the Operating Expenses for the then current calendar year. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord, as additional rent, one-twelfth (1I/12th) of the estimated Operating Expenses each month thereafter, beginning with the next installment of rent due, until such time as Landlord issues a revised Estimate Statement or the Estimate Statement for the succeeding calendar year; except that, concurrently with the regular monthly rent payment next due following the receipt of each such Estimate Statement, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord an amount equal to one monthly installment of the estimated Operating Expenses (less any applicable Operating Expenses already paid) multiplied by the number of months from January, in the current calendar year, to the month of such rent payment next due, all months inclusive. If at any time during the Term of this Lease, but not more often than quarterly, Landlord reasonably determines that the Operating Expenses for the current calendar year will be greater than the amount set forth in the then current Estimate Statement, Landlord may issue a revised Estimate Statement and Tenant agrees to pay Landlord, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the revised Estimate Statement, the difference between the amount owed by Tenant under such revised Estimate Statement and the amount owed by Tenant under the original Estimate Statement for the portion of the then current calendar year which has expired. Thereafter Tenant agrees to pay Operating Expenses based on such revised Estimate Statement until Tenant receives the next calendar years Estimate Statement or a new revised Estimate Statement for the current calendar year.</p>
          <p id="s1p205">(c) Actual Statement. As soon as practical following the end of each calendar year during the Term of this Lease, Landlord will also endeavor to deliver to Tenant a statement (Actual Statement) which states the actual Operating Expenses for the preceding calendar year. If the Actual Statement reveals that the actual Operating Expenses are more than the total additional rent paid by Tenant for Operating Expenses on account of the preceding calendar year, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord the difference in a lump sum within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Actual Statement. If the Actual Statement reveals that the actual Operating Expenses is less than the additional rent paid by Tenant for Operating Expenses on account of the preceding calendar year, Landlord will credit any overpayment toward the next monthly installment(s) of the Operating Expenses due under this Lease, or promptly refund such overpayment if the Term has ended.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">(d) Miscellaneous. Any delay or failure by Landlord in delivering any Estimate Statement or Actual Statement pursuant to this Section 5 will not constitute a waiver of its right to require an increase in rent nor will it relieve Tenant of its obligations pursuant to this Section 5, except that Tenant will not be obligated to make any payments based on such Estimate Statement or Actual Statement until thirty (30) days after receipt of such Estimate Statement or Actual Statement. Even though the Term has expired and Tenant has vacated the Premises, when the final determination is made of the actual Operating Expenses for the year in which this Lease terminates, Tenant agrees to promptly pay any increase due over the estimated expenses paid and, conversely, any overpayment made in the event said expenses decrease shall promptly be</p>

          <p id="s1p214">(e) Audit Rights. Tenant, within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving Landlords statement of actual Operating Expenses, may give Landlord written notice (Review Notice) that Tenant intends to review Landlords records of the Operating Expenses for the calendar year to which the statement applies. Within a reasonable time after receipt of the Review Notice, Landlord shall make all pertinent records available for inspection that are reasonably necessary for Tenant or Tenants agents to conduct its review, it being agreed that in no event shall Tenant retain any agents to conduct such review who are compensated in whole or in part on a contingency basis. If any records are maintained at a location other than the management office for the Building, Tenant may either inspect the records at such other location or pay for the reasonable cost of copying and shipping the records. Tenant shall be solely responsible for all costs, expenses and fees incurred for the audit unless the audit determines that Landlord has overstated Operating Expenses by greater than five percent (5%), in which case Landlord shall be responsible for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees incurred by Tenant for the audit, in an amount not to exceed $5,000 in anyone instance. Within thirty (30) days after the records are made available to Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to give Landlord written notice (an Objection Notice) stating in reasonable detail any objection to Landlords statement of actual Operating Expenses for that year. If Tenant fails to give Landlord an Objection Notice within the thirty (30) day period or fails to provide Landlord with a Review Notice within the one hundred twenty (120) day period described above, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved Landlords statement of actual Operating Expenses and shall be barred from raising any claims regarding the Operating Expenses for that year. In no event shall Tenant be permitted to examine Landlords records or to dispute any statement of actual Operating Expenses unless Tenant has paid and continues to pay all rent when due. If Tenant does not provide the Review Notice within the time period set forth above in this Section 5(e), such statement will be deemed final and binding on Tenant. Landlord and Tenant shall each use their best efforts to cooperate with each other to resolve any discrepancies between them in the accounting of Operating Expenses and additional rent. Further, upon request and prior to conducting any such audit, Tenant shall enter into a commercially reasonable form of nondisclosure agreement with respect to the materials reviewed during the course of the audit, and the results thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p215">6. SECURITY DEPOSIT. If at any time during the Term (including in satisfaction of the LOC Release Conditions, as set forth in Rider No. 4 attached hereto) Landlord holds a cash security deposit under this Lease (the Security Deposit), then the terms of this Section 6 shall apply to such Security Deposit. If and to the extent the Letter of Credit is returned to Tenant, subject to the terms and conditions of Rider No. 4 attached hereto, then upon return of the Letter of Credit, Tenant shall be required to deliver the Security Deposit to Landlord in immediately available funds, to be held by Landlord without liability for interest (unless required by laws) as security for the performance of Tenants obligations. The Security Deposit is not an advance payment of rent or a measure of damages. Landlord may use all or a portion of the Security Deposit to cure any default (beyond any applicable notice and cure periods) by Tenant, or to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage Landlord may suffer by reason of Tenants default (beyond any applicable notice and cure periods). If Landlord uses any portion of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall within ten (10) days of its receipt of a written demand restore the Security Deposit to its original amount, and Tenants failure to do so shall be a default under this Lease. Landlord shall return any balance of the Security Deposit to Tenant (after applying any amount that may be necessary to cure a default by Tenant and to compensate Landlord for loss or damage incurred as a result thereof) within forty-five (45) days after the date Tenant surrenders the Premises to Landlord in compliance with Section 10(a) below and Tenant has paid to Landlord any rent which then remains outstanding and is due and payable by Tenant under the terms of this Lease, excluding amounts which will be billed to Tenant more than thirty (30) days following the Commencement Date (such as Operating Expense reconciliations) which Tenant will pay in accordance with the terms of this Lease. Landlords obligations with respect to the Security Deposit are those of a debtor and not a trustee. Landlord can maintain the Security Deposit separate and apart from Landlords general funds or can commingle the Security Deposit with Landlords general and other funds. Landlord shall not be required to pay Tenant interest on the Security Deposit. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code (excepting subsection (b) thereof), and all other provisions of law, now or hereafter in force, which provide that Landlord may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy defaults in the payment of rent, to repair damage caused by Tenant or to clean the Premises, it being agreed that Landlord may, in addition, claim those sums reasonably necessary to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage caused by the act or omission of Tenant or any officer, employee, agent or invitee of Tenant.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent any Legal Requirements first becoming effective after the Commencement result in an obligation to construct any improvements or Alterations to the Premises or Building, then (A) Tenant shall be solely obligated to perform at its sole cost any improvements or Alterations which are required by reason of (i) the specific nature of Tenants use of the Premises (as opposed to office and other uses by tenants in general), (ii) any work or Alterations to the Premises made and paid for by Tenant or its agents, employees or contractors, or (iii) a default (beyond any applicable notice and cure periods hereunder) by Tenant, and (B) Landlord shall arrange for the performance of any capital improvements or other improvements or alterations that will cost more than Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) in each instance, that in each case are otherwise not required to be performed and paid for by Tenant as set forth in (A) above, and the cost thereof shall be amortized over the useful life of such improvement in the manner referenced in Section 13(a) below. Tenant agrees to comply with the Rules and Regulations referenced in Section 27 below; provided, however, that to the extent there is any inconsistency between any such Rules and Regulations and the remainder of this Lease, the remainder of this Lease shall govern and control. Tenant agrees not to use or allow the Premises to be used for any unlawful or otherwise reasonably objectionable purpose. Tenant agrees not to cause, maintain or permit any nuisance or waste in, on, under or about the Premises. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, all transferable development rights related in any way to the Premises are and will remain vested in Landlord, and Tenant hereby waives any rights thereto.</p>

Except for ordinary and general office supplies, equipment and facilities, such as copier toner, liquid paper, back-up power sources, glue, ink and common professional cleaning materials, as well as customary quantities of first aid and healthcare supplies and the parking of vehicles in the parking areas adjacent to the Premises (some or all of which may constitute Hazardous Materials as defined in this Lease), Tenant agrees not to cause or permit any Hazardous Materials to be brought upon, stored, used, handled, generated, released or disposed of on, in, under or about the Premises, the Building *or any portion thereof by Tenant, its agents, employees, subtenants, assignees, licensees, contractors or invitees (collectively, Tenant Parties) without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

The provisions of this Section 7(c) will survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. To the extent it is determined that Hazardous Materials exist at the Premises as of the Commencement Date in violation of laws governing Hazardous Materials, and such violation does not arise out of any wrongful acts or omissions of Tenant, its agents, employees or contractors, Landlord shall promptly take such action as is necessary to remove and remediate such Hazardous Materials in compliance with such laws at no cost to Tenant. If, following the Commencement Date, the Premises becomes contaminated with Hazardous Materials in violation of laws governing Hazardous Materials, and such violation does not arise out of any wrongful acts or omissions of Tenant, its agents, employees or contractors, Landlord shall promptly take such action as is necessary to remove and remediate such Hazardous Materials in compliance with such laws, at no cost to Tenant. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has advised Tenant that the Building contains or, because of its age, is likely to contain, asbestos. Upon Tenants request, Landlord will make available for review by Tenant at the Premises during normal business hours (without warranty) copies of any current asbestos management plans, inspection reports, test results or other similar documents in Landlords possession relating to the presence of asbestos at the Building. To the extent such reports or documents indicate the presence of asbestos at the Building, this provision shall constitute notice to Tenant as required by the California Health &amp; Safety Code. In connection with performing any work that may disturb asbestos at the Building, Tenant shall comply, at its cost, with any applicable laws or asbestos management plans relating to the Building. Tenant shall also comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations requiring disclosure to employees or invitees of the presence of asbestos or other hazardous materials at or around the Premises or the Building. Landlord has no special knowledge of the general procedures or handling restrictions to minimize or prevent the disturbance, release or exposure to asbestos or of the potential health risks that may result from any exposure to asbestos. Tenant is encouraged to contact local or state public health agencies for further information. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant shall not be obligated to pay the cost of remediation or to indemnify, protect, defend or hold harmless Landlord or any of the Landlord Indemnified Parties from or against, any claims, damages, judgments, suits, causes of action, losses, liabilities, penalties, fines, expenses and costs (including, without limitation, clean-up, removal, remediation and restoration costs, sums paid in settlement of claims, attorneys fees, consultant fees and expert fees and court costs) of any kind, if and to the extent arising, directly or indirectly, out of Hazardous Materials which are or were present at the Project in violation of Legal Requirements as of the date of execution and delivery of this Lease, or which later become located at the Project in violation of Legal Requirements through no fault (no act, omission or negligence) of Tenant or any of Tenants agents, employees, contractor or invitees.</p>

The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant, or a mutual cancellation thereof, shall not constitute a merger, and shall, at the option of Landlord, operate as an assignment to Landlord of any or all subleases or subtenancies. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant agrees to peaceably surrender the Premises to Landlord broom clean and in a state of good order, repair and condition, ordinary wear and tear (which shall encompass, among other items, the natural fading of painted surfaces, fabric and materials over time, and carpet wear caused by normal foot traffic) and casualty and condemnation damage excepted, but in any event with all carpeted areas cleaned and all floor areas cleaned and all of Tenants Property (as defined in Section 18 below) and Alterations (as defined in Section 12 below) and all cabling and wiring removed, unless and to the extent Tenant is not required to remove any such Alterations from the Premises pursuant to the terms of Article 12 of this Lease. Further, Tenant shall not be obligated to remove from the Premises at the end of the Term of the Lease any Tenant Improvements installed pursuant to the Work Letter, unless and to the extent Landlord specifies in writing at the time of approval of the Approved Working Drawings that Tenant is obligated to remove such items, it being agreed that Landlord shall not specify for removal any items of the Tenant Improvements which are standard office tenant improvements in compliance with Legal Requirements. In connection with the removal of any Tenant Improvements, Alterations or other items from the Premises, Tenant shall be solely responsible to repair at its sole cost and expense any damage caused by such removal and to restore the Premises to good condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. At least ninety (90) days, prior to the date Tenant is to actually surrender the Premises to Landlord, Tenant agrees to give Landlord notice of the exact date Tenant will surrender the Premises so that Landlord and Tenant can schedule a walk-through of the Premises to review the condition of the Premises, to confirm Tenants removal obligations, and to otherwise confirm Tenants obligations to surrender the Premises as required by this Lease. During such ninety (90) day period, Landlord may inspect the Premises and all equipment and fixtures located therein to determine if they are in the condition required for proper surrender by Tenant, or at Landlords option, Landlord may retain the services of one (1) or more inspectors or consultants to perform such inspections. If there are any deficiencies discovered in the condition of the Premises that do not comply with the surrender requirements established in this Section 10(a), Tenant will promptly cause the same to be corrected in a good and workmanlike manner at Tenants sole cost and expense prior to the surrender date. The delivery of keys to any employee of Landlord or to Landlords agent or any employee thereof alone will not be sufficient to constitute a termination of this Lease or a surrender of the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant does not wish to be obligated to remove items from the Premises or the Building at the expiration or earlier termination of the Term as set forth herein, Tenant shall have the right to request in writing, in connection with Landlords approval of any construction or installation by Tenant, that Tenant be entitled to leave certain items in place; provided that, if Tenant makes written request to Landlord concurrently with Tenants request for consent to any Alterations, then Landlord shall make its election whether or not to require removal of such Alterations, if at all, at the time consent to such Alterations is given, and Landlords failure to do so shall be deemed to constitute Landlords election not to require Tenant to remove the Alteration at issue.</p>
          <p id="s1p244">(b) Holding Over. Tenant will not be permitted to hold over possession of the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term without the express written consent of Landlord, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion. If Tenant holds over after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, Landlord may, at its option, treat Tenant as a tenant at sufferance only, and such continued occupancy by Tenant shall be subject to all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, so far as applicable, except that the Monthly Base Rent for any such holdover period shall be equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Monthly Base Rent in effect under this Lease immediately prior to such holdover, prorated on a daily basis. Acceptance by Landlord of rent after such expiration or earlier termination will not result in a renewal of this Lease. The provisions of this Section 10 are in addition to and do not affect Landlords right of re-entry or any rights of Landlord under this Lease or as otherwise provided by law. If Tenant fails to surrender the Premises upon the expiration of this Lease in accordance with the terms of this Section 10 despite demand to do so by Landlord, Tenant agrees to promptly indemnify, protect, defend and hold Landlord harmless</p>

          <p id="s1p252">11. TAXES.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">(a) Payment of Taxes. Tenant agrees to pay all Real Property Taxes, as defined in Section 11(b) below, as part of Operating Expenses, during the Term of this Lease. If any such Real Property Taxes paid by Tenant shall cover any period of time prior to or after the expiration of the Term thereof, Tenants share of such Real Property Taxes is to be equitably prorated to cover only the period of time within the tax fiscal year during which this Lease shall be in effect, and Landlord will reimburse Tenant to the extent required.</p>
          <p id="s1p254">(b) Definition of Real Property Taxes. The term Real Property Taxes as used herein means: any form of real estate assessment, license fee, license tax, business license fee, commercial rental tax, levy, charge, improvement bond, tax or similar imposition imposed by any authority having the direct power to tax, including any city, county, state or federal government, or any school, agricultural, lighting, drainage or other improvement or special assessment district thereof, as against any legal or equitable interest of Landlord in the Premises or any part thereof, including the following by way of illustration but not limitation (i) any tax on Landlords right to rent or as against Landlords business of leasing the Premises; and (ii) any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge in substitution, partially or totally, of any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge previously included within the definition of real property tax, excluding any liens or levies related to Hazardous Materials on or about the Premises that were not introduced onto the Premises by Tenant or any of Tenants agents, employees, contractors or invitees. It is the intention of Tenant and Landlord that all such new and increased assessments, taxes, fees, levies and charges be included within the definition of Real Property Taxes for the purposes of this Lease; (A) any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge allocable to or measured by the area of the Building or Premises or the rent payable by Tenant hereunder, including, without limitation, any gross receipts tax or excise tax levied by state, city or federal government, or any political subdivision thereof, with respect to the receipt of such rent, or upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operating, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises, or any portion thereof but not on Landlords other operations; (B) any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party, creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises; and/or (C) any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge by any governmental agency related to any transportation plan, fund or system (including assessment districts) instituted within the geographic area of which the Building is a part. In the case of any Real Property Taxes that may be evidenced by improvement or other bonds or that may be paid in annual or other periodic installments, for the purpose of calculating Impositions under this Lease, Landlord shall elect to cause such bonds to be issued or such assessment to be paid in installments over the maximum period permitted by applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Real Property Taxes shall not include, and Tenant shall have no obligation to payor reimburse Landlord for any of the following: (i) any franchise, estate, inheritance, succession or transfer tax of Landlord; (ii) any income, profits or revenue tax or charge upon the net income of Landlord from all sources; (iii) any penalties or interest charges (through no fault of Tenant); or (iv) any supplemental real estate taxes related to any period of time before or after the Term. Tenant shall have the right to request Landlord to contest Real Property Taxes assessed against the Premises or Tenants personal property, and if Landlord is not willing to undertake such contest, Landlord agrees that Tenant, at Tenants expense, can institute a contest on its own and Landlord will reasonably cooperate with such contest. Tax refunds shall be credited against Real Property Taxes and Tenants personal property taxes, as applicable, and refunded to Tenant regardless of when received, based on the Lease Year to which the refund is applicable during the Term; it being understood that this obligation shall survive the termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p255">(c) Personal Property Taxes. Tenant agrees to pay prior to delinquency all taxes assessed against and levied upon trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property of Tenant contained in the Premises. When reasonably possible, Tenant will request said trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property to be assessed and billed separately from the real property of Landlord. If any of Tenants personal property is assessed with Landlords real property, Tenant shall pay Landlord the taxes attributable to Tenant within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written statement and bill from the taxing authority setting forth the taxes applicable to Tenants property.</p>

          <p id="s1p263">(a) Alterations. Except as otherwise provided in the Work Letter, which shall apply to the Tenant Improvements, Tenant shall not make alterations, repairs, additions or improvements or install any Cable (collectively referred to as Alterations) without first obtaining the written consent of Landlord in each instance, which consent Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition. In order to obtain such approvals, Tenant shall furnish Landlord with plans and specifications; names of contractors reasonably acceptable to Landlord; required permits and approvals, if any; evidence of contractors and subcontractors insurance in amounts reasonably required by Landlord and naming Landlord as an additional insured on all commercial general liability policies; and any security for performance in amounts reasonably required by Landlord after taking into account all relevant factors including the financial strength of Tenant, provided, however, if the named Tenant hereunder (or an affiliate of Tenant under a Permitted Transfer) is the Tenant under the Lease and no breach or default by Tenant exists hereunder, Landlord shall not require security for the work to be performed unless the costs of the proposed work exceeds $1,000,000.00. Upon completion, Tenant shall furnish as-built plans for Alterations, completion affidavits and full and final waivers of lien.</p>
          <p id="s1p264">(b) Cosmetic Alterations. Notwithstanding the foregoing , so long as Tenant (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules (including the then current construction rules, guidelines and specifications for the Building), regulations and the terms and conditions of this Lease, and (ii) reasonably coordinates construction of the Alterations with Landlord, Tenant shall have the right, without Landlords consent, but upon three (3) business days prior written notice to Landlord, to make non-structural additions and alterations to the Premises that do not (A) involve the expenditure of more than $75,000.00 in anyone instance, (B) affect the appearance of the Building or any areas outside the Premises, or (C) affect or impact in any material way the systems or structure of the Building, or (D) require the issuance of a building permit (collectively, the Cosmetic Alterations).</p>
          <p id="s1p265">(c) Plan Review. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord, as additional rent, the actual and reasonable, out-of-pocket costs of professional services and costs for general conditions of Landlords third party consultants if utilized by Landlord for review of all plans, specifications and working drawings for any Alterations, within thirty (30) days after Tenants receipt of invoices either from Landlord or such consultants. In addition, with respect to any Alterations (other than Cosmetic Alterations), Tenant agrees to pay Landlord, within thirty (30) days after completion of any Alterations, a fee in the amount of five percent (5%) of the cost of such Alterations, but in no event less than Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00).</p>
          <p id="s1p266">(d) Personal Property. All articles of personal property owned by Tenant or installed by Tenant at its expense in the Premises (including Tenants business and trade fixtures, furniture, movable partitions, Cable and equipment [such as telephones, copy machines, computer terminals, refrigerators and facsimile machines]) will be and remain the property of Tenant, and, unless otherwise agreed between Landlord and Tenant in writing, must be removed by Tenant from the Premises, at Tenants sole cost and expense, on or before the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. Tenant agrees to repair any damage caused by such removal at its cost on or before the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p267">(e) Removal of Alterations. If Tenant fails to remove by the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease all of its personal property, Cable, or any Alterations required to be removed hereunder under Section 10(a) above, Landlord may (without liability to Tenant for loss thereof) treat such personal property, Cable and/or Alterations as abandoned and, at Tenants sole cost and expense, and in addition to Landlords other rights and remedies under this Lease, at law or in equity: (i) remove and store such items; and/or (ii) upon ten (10) days prior notice to Tenant, sell, discard or otherwise dispose of all or any such items at private or public sale for such price as Landlord may obtain or by other commercially reasonable means. Tenant shall be liable for all costs of disposition of Tenants abandoned property and Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant with respect to any such abandoned property.</p>

In performing its obligations set forth herein, Tenant shall consistently exercise and perform good maintenance practices, specifically including arranging for and maintaining at Tenants cost (with copies to Landlord) maintenance and service contracts reasonably approved by Landlord for HVAC equipment, fire extinguishing and alarm systems, roof preventative maintenance and landscaping maintenance, which maintenance and service contracts (other than for landscaping) shall include a requirement for an annual inspection. Upon Landlords request, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of each inspection report. In addition, Tenant shall arrange for any required maintenance and the correction of any defects noted in any such inspection report. Tenant agrees to cause any mechanics liens or other liens arising as a result of work performed by Tenant or at Tenants direction to be eliminated as provided in Section 14 below. In the event Tenant fails to maintain any required maintenance or service contract, or fails to obtain and deliver to Landlord an inspection report, Landlord shall have the right (following written notice to Tenant and the expiration of applicable cure periods), to arrange for such maintenance and service contracts, and the required inspections, and Tenant shall pay the cost thereof within thirty (30) days of Landlords delivery of an invoice therefor. In any event, Tenant shall pay the costs of and arrange for the correction of any deficiencies found. Tenant shall perform at its expense routine and non-capital maintenance of the Building Systems. Tenant shall be responsible for work relating to the Building Structure only if and to the extent the need for any such work arises out of or results from specific work or acts conducted by Tenant at the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p277">(b) Tenants Failure to Repair. If Tenant refuses or neglects to repair and maintain the Premises properly as required hereunder to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord, Landlord, at any time following twenty (20) days from the date Landlord delivers to Tenant a written demand to effect such repair or maintenance, may enter upon the Premises and make such repairs and/or maintenance, and upon completion thereof, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord as additional rent, Landlords costs for making such repairs plus an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of such costs for overhead, within thirty (30) days of receipt from Landlord of a written itemized bill therefor. Any amounts not reimbursed by Tenant within such thirty (30) day period will bear interest at the Interest Rate until paid by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p278">(c) Landlords Obligations. Except for the obligations of Landlord under Section 19 below relating to damage or destruction of the Premises, or under Section 20 below relating to eminent domain (it being acknowledged and agreed that such provisions shall control in the event of casualty or condemnation, as applicable), it is intended by the parties that Landlords sole obligation to repair and maintain the Premises and to pay the cost thereof shall be as set forth in this Section 13(c) and in Section 13(d). Tenant waives the right to make repairs at Landlords expense under any law, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation. Landlord shall at no cost to Tenant (unless and to the extent specifically set forth in this Lease) maintain and repair as needed, and, if necessary, replace the Building Structure, and shall complete any necessary capital repairs or replacement of the roof membranes, it being acknowledged that non-capital repairs of the roof membranes shall be the responsibility of Tenant as set forth in Section 13(a) above, provided, however, Landlord agrees to repair and maintain the roof membrane of the 211 Building until such time as it is recoated (and thereafter, Tenant shall assume non-capital repairs and maintenance of such roof).</p>
          <p id="s1p279">(d) Capital Repairs and Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13(a) above, Landlord shall cause to be completed any capital repairs or capital replacement work required to be performed with respect to the Building Structure or Building Systems of the Premises during the Term of this Lease. Only if and to the extent any such required repairs and replacements are the specific responsibility of Tenant under this Lease, the amortized cost of such work shall be included in Operating Expenses payable by Tenant under the terms of this Lease. For purposes of the foregoing, the following shall govern: (1) Required work shall be deemed a capital repair or a capital replacement if it would normally be required to be capitalized under generally accepted commercial real estate accounting principles; (2) the cost of any capital repair or capital replacement shall be amortized over the useful life of the improvement, as reasonably determined by Landlord, at an annual interest rate equal to Wells Fargo Prime plus one percent (1%), and Tenant shall pay the monthly amortization amount during the Term of this Lease, as part of Operating Expenses; and (3) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the cost of any resurfacing of the driveways or parking areas will exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) then such work shall likewise be deemed a capital repair hereunder and shall be amortized under clause (2) above and shall likewise be payable by Tenant monthly</p>

          <p id="s1p287">14. LIENS. Tenant agrees not to permit any mechanics, materialmens or other liens to be filed against all or any part of the Premises, nor against Tenants leasehold interest in the Premises, by reason of or in connection with any repairs, alterations, improvements or other work contracted for or undertaken by Tenant or any other act or omission of Tenant or Tenants agents, employees, contractors, licensees or invitees. At Landlords request, Tenant agrees to provide Landlord with enforceable, conditional and final lien releases (or other evidence reasonably requested by Landlord to demonstrate protection from liens) from all persons furnishing labor and/or materials at the Project for other than the Tenant Improvements. Landlord will have the right at all reasonable times to post on the Premises and record any notices of non-responsibility which it deems necessary for protection from such liens. If any such liens are filed, Tenant will, at its sole cost, promptly cause such liens to be released of record or bonded so that it no longer affects title to the Premises. If Tenant fails to cause any such liens to be so released or bonded within ten (10) business days after Tenants receipt of notice of the filing thereof, such failure will be deemed a material breach by Tenant under this Lease without the benefit of any additional notice or cure period described in Section 21 below, and Landlord may, without waiving its rights and remedies based on such breach, and without releasing Tenant from any of its obligations, cause such liens to be released by any means it shall deem proper, including payment in satisfaction of the claims giving rise to such liens. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord within thirty (30) days after receipt of invoice from Landlord, any required sum paid by Landlord to remove such liens, together with interest at the Interest Rate from the date of such payment by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p288">15. ENTRY BY LANDLORD. Landlord and its employees and agents will at all times have the right to enter the Premises to inspect the same, to show the Premises to prospective purchasers or, during the last two hundred seventy (270) days of the Term only, tenants, to post notices of non-responsibility, and/or to repair the Premises as permitted or required by this Lease. In exercising such entry rights, Landlord will minimize, as reasonably practicable, the interference with Tenants business, and will provide Tenant with not less than one (1) business days advance notice of any such entry and abide by Tenants reasonable security requirements (except in emergency situations). Landlord may, in order to carry out such purposes, erect scaffolding and other necessary structures where reasonably required by the character of the work to be performed. Landlord will at all times have and retain a key with which to unlock all doors in the Premises, excluding Tenants vaults and safes and other confidential and proprietary areas. Landlord will have the right to use any and all means which Landlord may reasonably deem proper to open said doors in an emergency in order to obtain entry to the Premises. Any entry to the Premises obtained by Landlord by any of said means, or otherwise in accordance with this Section 15, will not be construed or deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into the Premises, or an eviction of Tenant from the Premises. Landlord will not be liable to Tenant for any damages or losses for any entry by Landlord in accordance with this Section 15.</p>
          <p id="s1p289">16. UTILITIES AND SERVICES.</p>
          <p id="s1p290">(a) Utilities and Services. Effective as of the Commencement Date and throughout the Term, Tenant agrees to contract directly for and to pay for all utilities and services provided to the Premises (including the Land and the Building), including, without limitation, water, gas, heat, light, power, telephone, waste/trash removal, sewer and other utilities, janitorial and cleaning services, landscaping and outdoor maintenance, together with any taxes thereon. Landlord will not be liable to Tenant for any failure to furnish any of the foregoing utilities and services if such failure is caused by all or any of the following: (a) accident, breakage or repairs; (b) strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbance or labor dispute of any character; (c) governmental regulation, moratorium or other governmental action or inaction; (d) inability despite the exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain electricity, water or fuel; or (e) any other cause beyond Landlords reasonable control. In addition, in the event of any stoppage or interruption of services or utilities, except as otherwise specifically set forth in Section 16(c) below, Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement or reduction of rent (except as expressly provided in Section 19(f) below or Section 20(b) below if such failure results from a damage or taking described therein), no eviction of Tenant will result from such failure and Tenant will not be relieved from the performance of any covenant or agreement in this Lease because of such failure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Tenant acknowledges and agrees that it shall be solely responsible for providing adequate security for its Premises, and its use of the</p>

          <p id="s1p298">(b) 211 Building HVAC Units.</p>
          <p id="s1p299">(i) If it becomes necessary (as referenced below) for any of the existing package rooftop units located upon or serving the building located at 211 River Oaks Parkway (each a 211 Building HVAC Unit and, collectively, the 211 Building HVAC Units) to be replaced (rather than just be repaired and maintained as set forth in Section 13(a) above), Landlord will arrange for such replacement promptly and with diligence so as to minimize any disruption to Tenants business operations. Landlord will work with Tenant to schedule a time for the completion of such work so that Tenants business and comfort during business hours will not be compromised by performance of the necessary work. The following guidelines shall be applicable to a determination of whether replacement rather than repair of any or all of the 211 Building HVAC Units is necessary:</p>
          <p id="s1p300">If the subject 211 Building HVAC Unit or Units fails two (2) or more times in a 12- month period (provided that the 211 Building HVAC Units at issue have not been operated by Tenant in an abusive manner), with each such failure resulting in the need for an outside HVAC system technician to make a service call to the 211 Building in order to complete the necessary repairs to return the 211 Building HVAC Unit or Units to functionality; and/or</p>
          <p id="s1p301">If it is determined, based upon competitive bids obtained from reputable HVAC contractors, that the cost of the necessary repairs is reasonably expected to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of such system.</p>
          <p id="s1p302">(ii) If it is determined based upon the foregoing that any of the 211 Building HVAC Units need to be replaced through no fault of Tenant, and as a result the 211 Building will not be served by HVAC service for a period of time, Landlord shall at its cost make the necessary arrangements in order to provide temporary HVAC service to the 211 Building until the new HVAC units are installed and operational, which measures may include the use of box car or similar temporary HVAC units at the 211 Building</p>
          <p id="s1p303">(iii) Based on the foregoing, if and to the extent Landlord is required to replace the existing 211 Building HVAC Units within the initial Term, Landlord shall pay the cost of such replacement, and such costs will not be included within Operating Expenses. If the existing 211 Building HVAC Units require replacement following the expiration of the initial Term, the costs thereof shall be amortized over the useful life of such system in accordance with generally accepted commercial building accounting practices and such monthly amortized costs shall be included within Operating Expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p304">(c) Abatement of Rent When Tenant Is Prevented From Using Premises. In the event that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or any portion thereof, for five (5) days, or after ten (10) non-consecutive business days within any twelve (12) month period during the Term of the Lease (the Eligibility Period), as a result of (i) any cessation of essential utilities and services provided to the Premises, or (ii) any failure by Landlord to perform any repairs required to be performed by Landlord under Section 13 above or elsewhere in this Lease, within a reasonable time after Landlord has received notice from Tenant of the need for such repairs, but in no event longer than thirty (30) days (or such longer period of time as is reasonably required for such repair work if Landlord diligently commences such repair work within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes same to completion), or (iii) the presence and remediation of any Hazardous Materials in, on or about the Premises as set forth in Section 7(c) above, then Tenants obligation to pay Monthly Base Rent shall be abated or reduced, as the case may be, from and after the first (1st) day following the Eligibility Period and continuing until such time that Tenant continues to be so prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or a portion thereof, in the proportion that the rentable square feet of the portion of the Premises that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total rentable square feet of the Premises; provided, however, that Tenant shall not be entitled to abatement or reduction of rent to the extent the matters described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) were not caused by any wrongful acts or omissions of Landlord or any of Landlords agents, employees or contractors, or such matters arise out of or result from a matter outside of Landlords reasonable control. It is further acknowledged and agreed that if Tenant would be otherwise be entitled to rental abatement under the terms of this subsection (c) but for the cause of the loss at issue being outside of Landlords control, Tenant may still be entitled to an abatement of rent as set forth in this subsection (c) if and to the extent the rental abatement to</p>

          <p id="s1p312">17. ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND INDEMNIFICATION.</p>
          <p id="s1p313">(a) Assumption of Risk. Tenant, as a material part of the consideration to Landlord, hereby agrees that neither Landlord nor any Landlord Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section 7(c) above) will be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant expressly assumes the risk of and waives any and all claims it may have against Landlord or any Landlord Indemnified Parties with respect to, (i) any and all damage to property or injury to persons in, upon or about the Premises or any part thereof (except to the extent resulting from the negligent or willful act or omission or violation of any Legal Requirements by Landlord, Landlords contractors, or any Landlord Indemnified Parties), (ii) any such damage caused by other tenants or persons in or about the Premises, or caused by quasi-public work, (iii) any damage to property entrusted to employees of the Premises, (iv) any loss of or damage to property by theft or otherwise, or (v) any injury or damage to persons or property resulting from any casualty, explosion, falling plaster or other masonry or glass, steam, gas, electricity, water or rain which may leak from any part of the Building or from the pipes, appliances or plumbing works therein or from the roof, street or subsurface or from any other place, or resulting from dampness (except to the extent resulting from the negligent or willful act or omission of Landlord, Landlords contractors, or any Landlord Indemnified Parties). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, neither Landlord nor any Landlord Indemnified Parties will be liable for consequential damages to Tenants business or loss of income therefrom arising out of any loss of the use of the Premises or any equipment or facilities therein by Tenant or any Tenant Parties or for interference with light or other incorporeal hereditaments. Tenant agrees to endeavor to give prompt notice to Landlord in case of fire or accidents in the Premises, or of defects therein or in the fixtures or equipment of which Tenant becomes aware.</p>
          <p id="s1p314">(b) Indemnification. Tenant will be liable for, and agrees, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, to indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Landlord and Landlord Indemnified Parties, from and against, any and all claims, damages, judgments, suits, causes of action, losses, liabilities, penalties, fines, expenses and costs, including attorneys fees and court costs (collectively, Indemnified Claims), to the extent arising or resulting from (i) any negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of Tenant or any Tenant Parties (as defined in Section 7(c) above); (ii) the use of the Premises and conduct of Tenants business by Tenant or any Tenant Parties, or any other activity, work or thing done by Tenant or any Tenant Parties, in or about the Premises; and/or (iii) any default by Tenant of any obligations on Tenants part to be performed under the terms of this Lease; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnities shall not apply to the extent the Indemnified Claim arises out of or results from the violation of any Legal Requirements, negligence (but only to the extent the Indemnified Claims are not actually covered by insurance Tenant is required to carry under this Lease), gross negligence, or willful misconduct of Landlord or any of the Landlord Indemnified Parties. In case any action or proceeding is brought against Landlord or any Landlord Indemnified Parties by reason of any such Indemnified Claims, Tenant, upon notice from Landlord, agrees to promptly defend the same at Tenants sole cost and expense by counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord, which approval Landlord will not unreasonably withhold. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 17 above to the contrary, Tenants indemnity of Landlord and the Landlord Parties shall not apply to: (i) any claims to the extent resulting from the negligence (but only to the extent the Indemnified Claims are not covered by insurance Tenant is required to carry under this Lease), gross negligence or willful misconduct of or violation of Legal Requirements by Landlord or any of the Landlord Parties (collectively, the Excluded Claims); or (ii) any loss of or damage to Landlords property to the extent Landlord has waived such loss or damage pursuant to Section 18(f) below. In addition, Landlord shall indemnify, defend (using counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant, approval Tenant shall not unreasonably withhold), protect and hold harmless Tenant and Tenants partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from all such Excluded Claims, except for (A) any loss or damage to Tenants property to the extent Tenant has waived such loss or damage pursuant to Section 18(f) below, and (B) any lost profits, loss of business or other consequential damages to Tenants business.</p>
          <p id="s1p315">(c) Survival; No Release of Insurers. Tenants and Landlords indemnification obligations under Section 17(b) will survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. The covenants, agreements and indemnification obligation in Sections 17(a) and 17(b) above, are not intended to and will not relieve any insurance carrier of its obligations under policies required to be carried by the parties hereto pursuant to the provisions of this Lease.</p>

Landlord makes no representation that the limits of liability required to be carried by Tenant under the terms of this Lease are adequate to protect Tenants interests and Tenant should obtain such additional insurance or increased liability limits as Tenant deems appropriate. No policy required hereunder shall contain a co-insurance clause and all policy deductibles in excess of $100,000.00 must be approved by Landlord, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by Landlord.</p>

          <p id="s1p337">(b) Supplemental Tenant Insurance Requirements. Any company writing Tenants Insurance shall have an A.M. Best rating of not less than A-:VIII and shall be licensed to issue insurance coverage in the state in which the premises are located. All Commercial General Liability Insurance policies shall (i) name Landlord (or its successors and assignees), the managing agent for the Building (or any successor), and their respective members, principals, beneficiaries, partners, officers, directors, employees, and agents, and other designees of Landlord and its successors having an interest in the Premises as the interest of such designees shall appear, as additional insureds, (ii) must contain an endorsement stating such insurance as is afforded by this policy for the benefit of Landlord and any other additional insured(s) designated by Landlord, shall be primary as respects any liability or claims arising out of the occupancy of the Premises by Tenant or Tenants operations, and any insurance carried by Landlord or any other additional insured(s) shall be non-contributory (iii) with respect to Tenants property insurance only, contain an endorsement that the insurer waives its right to subrogation as described in Section 18(f) below; (iv) contain a cross-liability endorsement or separation of insureds clause. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a certificate of insurance evidencing all insurance required to be carried by Tenant hereunder (including evidence of all required endorsements and additional insured coverage as noted above) prior to the earlier to occur of the Commencement Date or the date Tenant is provided with possession of the Premises (and in any event prior to the commencement of the Early Access Period), and thereafter as necessary to assure that Landlord always has current certificates evidencing Tenants Insurance. If any such initial or replacement policies or certificates are not furnished within the time(s) specified herein and such failure continues for three (3) business days after Tenants receipt of notice thereof from Landlord, Tenant shall be deemed to be in material Default under this Lease without the benefit of any additional notice or cure period provided in Section 21 below, and Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to procure such policies and certificates at Tenants expense, and Tenant shall pay the cost thereof within thirty (30) days following Landlords submission of an invoice therefor. In no event shall the limits of any insurance policy obtained by a Tenant be considered to limit the liability of Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p338">(c) Property Insurance. Landlord shall obtain, at Tenants sole cost and expense, a policy or policies of insurance covering loss or damage to the Premises (including the Tenant Improvements as referenced above), in the amount of the full replacement value thereof, as the same may exist from time to time, but in no event less than the total amount required by lenders having liens on the Premises (but not any of Tenants property), against all perils included within the classification of fire, extended coverage, vandalism, malicious mischief, flood, earthquake, and special extended perils (All Risk, as such term is used in the insurance industry), including twelve (12) months rent loss insurance. Said insurance shall provide for payment of loss to Landlord, or to the holders of mortgages or the beneficiaries under deeds of trust on the Premises. If the Premises are part of a group of buildings owned by Landlord which are adjacent to the Premises, then Tenant shall pay for any increase in the property insurance of such other buildings if said increase is caused by Tenants acts, omissions, use or occupancy of the Premises. If Tenant determines that cost of obtaining and maintaining flood and/or earthquake insurance required under the terms of this Lease is no longer commercially reasonable, Landlord agrees to seek the consent of its Lender to reduce or otherwise adjust such obligation to insure.</p>
          <p id="s1p339">(d) Tenants Use. Tenant will not keep, use, sell or offer for sale in or upon the Premises any article which may be prohibited by any insurance policy periodically in force covering the Premises. If Tenants occupancy or business in, or on, the Premises, whether or not Landlord has consented to the same, results in any increase in premiums for the insurance periodically carried by Landlord with respect to the Building or results in the need for Landlord to maintain special or additional insurance, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord the cost of any such increase in premiums or special or additional coverage as additional rent within thirty (30) days after being billed therefor by Landlord. In determining whether increased premiums are a result of Tenants use of the Premises, a schedule issued by the organization computing the insurance rate on the Building showing the various components of such rate, will be conclusive evidence of the several items and charges which make up such rate. Tenant agrees to promptly comply with all reasonable requirements of the insurance authority or any present or future insurer relating to the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p340">(e) Cancellation of Landlords Policies. If any of Landlords insurance policies are canceled or cancellation is threatened or the coverage reduced or threatened to be reduced in any way because of the use of the Premises or any part thereof in violation of this Lease by Tenant or any assignee or subtenant of Tenant or by anyone Tenant permits on the Premises and, if Tenant fails to remedy the condition giving rise to such cancellation, threatened cancellation, reduction of coverage, threatened reduction of coverage, increase in premiums, or threatened increase in premiums, within three (3) business days after notice thereof, Tenant will</p>

          <p id="s1p348">(f) Waiver of Claims. Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, the parties hereto release each other, and their respective agents, employees and approved subtenants from any liability for damage to property that arises out of or incident to any peril which is actually insured against, which is required to be insured against under this Lease, or which would normally be covered by so called all risk property insurance, without regard to the negligence or willful misconduct of the entity or party so released or any other cause. Each party shall cause each property insurance policy it obtains to provide that the insurer thereunder waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation as required herein in connection with any injury or damage covered by the policy.</p>
          <p id="s1p349">19. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.</p>
          <p id="s1p350">(a) Landlords Obligation to Rebuild. If the Premises are damaged by fire or other casualty, then Landlord shall promptly and diligently repair or restore the Premises subject to the provisions of this Section 19 (excluding Alterations, Tenants Property and other improvements which Landlord is not obligated to restore pursuant to the terms hereof), unless Landlord or Tenant has the option to terminate this Lease as provided herein, and Landlord or Tenant exercises such option.</p>
          <p id="s1p351">(b) Right to Terminate. Landlord and Tenant shall each have the option to terminate this Lease if the Premises are destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty, regardless of whether the casualty is insured against under this Lease, if Landlord reasonably determines that (i) the damage is of a type not covered by the insurance Landlord is required to carry, or actually carries under this Lease, and the cost to repair the damage will exceed $500,000.00 for anyone (1) building comprising the Premises, (ii) the repair or restoration of the Premises is substantial and cannot be completed within two hundred seventy (270) days following the date of delivery of Landlords Repair Notice, or (iii) Landlord is not permitted by applicable Legal Requirements to rebuild the Premises in substantially the same form as existed prior to the fire or other casualty. If Landlord or Tenant elects to exercise the option to terminate this Lease as a result of a casualty, Landlord or Tenant shall exercise the option by giving the other party notice of its election to terminate this Lease within thirty (30) days following delivery of Landlords Repair Notice, in which event this Lease shall terminate thirty (30) days after the date of the notice of election by Landlord or Tenant, as applicable, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Landlord and Tenant. If neither Landlord nor Tenant exercises its right to terminate this Lease, Landlord shall promptly commence the process of obtaining all of the necessary permits and approvals for the repair or restoration of the Premises or the Building as soon as practicable and thereafter prosecute the repair or restoration of the Premises or the Building diligently to completion and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p352">(c) Notice. Within sixty (60) days following the date Landlord becomes aware of the occurrence of a casualty affecting the Premises (the Notice Period), Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a written notice (Repair Notice) setting forth the reasonably projected time for completion of the necessary repairs and restoration to address the casualty event, and a good faith estimate of the costs to be incurred to restore the Premises, including the Tenant Improvements, which estimates shall be based upon consultation with and the determination of qualified and experienced contractors. Such Repair Notice shall also confirm whether Landlord reasonably expects to be permitted by applicable Legal Requirements to rebuild the Premises as referenced in subsection 19(b)(iii) above.</p>
          <p id="s1p353">(d) Tenants Costs and Insurance Proceeds. In the event of any damage or destruction of all or any part of the Premises, Tenant agrees to immediately (i) notify Landlord thereof, and (ii) deliver to Landlord all property insurance proceeds received by Tenant with respect to any items or improvements which Landlord is obligated to restore hereunder, if any (it being acknowledged and agreed that Landlord shall not be obligated to restore, and Tenant shall not be obligated to deliver to Landlord any insurance proceeds for, Alterations and Tenants Property, whether or not this Lease is terminated as permitted in this Section 19), and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all rights to receive such insurance proceeds; provided, however, that unless and to the extent Landlord fails to cover the insurance coverage Landlord is obligated to carry under the terms of this Lease, Landlord shall not be obligated to restore improvements for which it has not received insurance proceeds or other payment by Tenant. If Tenants fails to carry the insurance required under Section 18(a)(ii) hereof, Tenant will be deemed to have self-insured the replacement cost of the items for which Tenant is obligated to</p>

          <p id="s1p361">(e) Abatement of Rent. In the event of any damage, repair, reconstruction and/or restoration described in this Section 19, rent will be abated or reduced, as the case may be, in proportion to the degree to which Tenants use of the Premises is impaired until such use is restored or this Lease is terminated. Except for abatement of rent as provided hereinabove, Tenant will not be entitled to any compensation or damages for loss of, or interference with, Tenants business or use or access of all or any part of the Premises or for lost profits or any other consequential damages of any kind or nature, which result from any such damage, repair, reconstruction or restoration.</p>

          <p id="s1p363">(g) Damage Near End of Term. Landlord and Tenant shall each have the right to terminate this Lease if any material damage to the Building occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the Term of this Lease where Landlords contractor estimates in a writing delivered to Landlord and Tenant that the repair, reconstruction or restoration of such damage cannot be completed within sixty (60) days after the date of such casualty. If either party desires to terminate this Lease under this Section 19(h), it shall provide written notice to the other party of such election within ten (10) days after receipt of Landlords contractors repair estimates; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may not terminate this Lease pursuant to this Section 19(g) if Tenant, at the time of such damage, has an option to extend the Term and Tenant exercises such option within ten (10) business days following the delivery to Tenant of Landlords termination notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p364">(h) Waiver of Termination Right. Landlord and Tenant agree that the foregoing provisions of this Section 19 are to govern their respective rights and obligations in the event of any damage or destruction and supersede and are in lieu of the provisions of any applicable law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order or ruling now or hereafter in force which provide remedies for damage or destruction of leased premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p365">(i) Termination. Upon any termination of this Lease under any of the provisions of this Section 19 and Landlords return to Tenant of any and all prepaid rent and cash security deposit or letter of credit held by Landlord hereunder, the parties will be released without further obligation to the other from the date possession of the Premises is surrendered to Landlord except for items which have accrued and are unpaid as of the date of termination and matters which are to survive any termination of this Lease as provided in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p366">20. EMINENT DOMAIN.</p>
          <p id="s1p367">(a) Substantial Taking. If (i) more than fifty percent (50%) of the floor area of the Building, or fifty percent (50%) of the land area of the Premises which is not occupied by the Building, is taken for any public or quasi-public purpose by any lawful power or authority by exercise of the right of appropriation, condemnation or eminent domain, or sold to prevent such taking (Condemned or Condemnation), or (ii) if any smaller portion of the Premises is Condemned, and such partial Condemnation renders the Premises unusable for the business of Tenant, as reasonably determined by Tenant and Landlord, either party will have the right to terminate this Lease effective as of the date possession is required to be surrendered to such authority.</p>

          <p id="s1p375">(c) Condemnation Award. In connection with any taking of all or any portion of the Premises, Landlord will be entitled to receive the entire amount of any award which may be made or given in such taking or condemnation, without deduction or apportionment for any estate or interest of Tenant, it being expressly understood and agreed by Tenant that no portion of any such award will be allowed or paid to Tenant for any so-called bonus or excess value of this Lease, and such bonus or excess value will be the sole property of Landlord; provided, however, Tenant will have the right to recover from the condemning authority (but not from Landlord unless included in the award to Landlord) any compensation as may be separately awarded or recoverable by Tenant for the taking of Tenants furniture, fixtures, equipment and other personal property within the Premises, for Tenants moving and relocation expenses, and for loss of goodwill and any other damage to Tenants business by reason of such taking.</p>

The provisions of any such notice will be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any notice required under applicable law as long as such notice is prepared and served upon Tenant in accordance with Section 1161 of the California Code of Civil Procedure (or any successor statute) and otherwise in accordance with applicable all applicable Legal Requirements. If the nature of Tenants default is such that more than thirty (30) days (or such other period of time as may be specified in this Lease as to the specific circumstances) are reasonably required for its cure, then Tenant will not be deemed to be in default if Tenant, with Landlords concurrence, commences such cure within such thirty (30) day period (or such other period of time as may be specified in this Lease as to the specific circumstances) and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to completion.</p>

          <p id="s1p390">(b) Landlords Remedies; Termination. In the event of any default by Tenant, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity under applicable law, Landlord will have the immediate right and option to terminate this Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease then, to the extent permitted under applicable law, Landlord may recover from Tenant: (i) the worth at the time of award of any unpaid rent which had been earned at the time of such termination; plus (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rent loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rent loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; plus (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenants failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which, in the ordinary course of things, results therefrom including, but not limited to: attorneys fees and costs; brokers commissions; the costs of refurbishment, alterations, renovation and repair of the Premises, and removal (including the repair of any damage caused by such removal) and storage (or disposal) of Tenants personal property, equipment, fixtures, Alterations and any other items which Tenant is required under this Lease to remove but does not remove, as well as the unamortized value of any free or reduced rent granted by Landlord pursuant to this Lease. The unamortized value of such concessions shall be determined by taking the total value of such concessions and multiplying such value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of the Term of the Lease not yet elapsed as of the date on which this Lease is terminated, and the denominator of which is the total number of months of the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p391">As used in Sections 21(b)(i) and (ii) above, the worth at the time of award is computed by allowing interest at the Interest Rate. As used in Section 21(b)(iii) above, the worth at the time of award is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%).</p>
          <p id="s1p392">(c) Landlords Remedies; Re-Entry Rights. In the event of any default by Tenant, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord under this Lease, at law or in equity, Landlord will also have the right, with or without terminating this Lease, and subject to all applicable legal due process requirements, to re-enter the Premises and remove all persons and property from the Premises; such property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere and/or disposed of at the sole cost and expense of and for the account of Tenant in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(h) of this Lease or any other procedures permitted by applicable law. No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord pursuant to this Section 21(c) will be construed as an election to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such intention is given to Tenant or unless the termination thereof is decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
          <p id="s1p393">(d) Landlords Remedies; Re-Letting. In the event that Landlord elects to re-enter the Premises or takes possession of the Premises pursuant to legal proceeding, if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease, Landlord may from time to time, without terminating this Lease, either recover all rent as it becomes due or relet the Premises or any part thereof on terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion may deem advisable with the right to make alterations and repairs to the Premises in connection with such reletting. If Landlord elects to relet the Premises, then rents received by Landlord from such reletting will be applied: first, to the payment of any indebtedness other than rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; second, to the payment of any cost of such reletting, it being understood that the costs of reletting chargeable to Tenant shall exclude the cost of decorating or improving the Premises for a new tenant; third, to the payment of rent due and unpaid hereunder and the residue, if any, will be held by Landlord and applied to payment of future rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder. Should that portion of such rents received from such reletting during any month, which is applied to the payment of rent hereunder, be less than the rent payable during that month by Tenant hereunder, then Tenant agrees to pay such deficiency to Landlord immediately upon demand therefor by Landlord. Such deficiency will be calculated and paid monthly.</p>
          <p id="s1p394">(e) Landlords Remedies; Performance for Tenant. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Lease, all covenants and agreements to be performed by Tenant under any of the terms of this Lease are to be performed by Tenant at Tenants sale cost and expense and without any abatement of rent.

Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord promptly upon demand for all sums so paid by Landlord and all necessary incidental costs, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate, from the date of such payment by Landlord until reimbursed by Tenant. This remedy shall be in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord set forth in this Section 21.</p>
          <p id="s1p402">(f) Late Payment. If Tenant fails to pay any installment of rent within five (5) days of the date when due or if Tenant fails to make any other payment for which Tenant is obligated under this Lease within five (5) days of the date when due, such late amount will accrue interest at the Interest Rate and Tenant agrees to pay Landlord as additional rent such interest on such amount from the date such amount becomes due until such amount is paid. In addition, if Tenant fails to pay any installment of rent within five (5) days of the date when due or if Tenant fails to make any other payment for which Tenant is obligated under this Lease within five (5) days of the date when due, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord concurrently with such late payment amount, as additional rent, a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due to compensate Landlord for the extra costs Landlord will incur as a result of such late payment. The parties agree that (i) it would be impractical and extremely difficult to fix the actual damage Landlord will suffer in the event of Tenants late payment, (ii) such interest and late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the detriment that Landlord will suffer by reason of late payment by Tenant, and (iii) the payment of interest and late charges are distinct and separate in that the payment of interest is to compensate Landlord for the use of Landlords money by Tenant, while the payment of late charges is to compensate Landlord for Landlords processing, administrative and other costs incurred by Landlord as a result of Tenants delinquent payments. Acceptance of any such interest and late charge will not constitute a waiver of the Tenants default with respect to the overdue amount, or prevent Landlord from exercising any of the other rights and remedies available to Landlord. If Tenant incurs a late charge more than three (3) times in any period of twelve (12) months during the Term, then, notwithstanding that Tenant cures the late payments for which such late charges are imposed, Landlord will have the right for the next one-year period to require Tenant thereafter to (i) pay all installments of Monthly Base Rent quarterly in advance throughout the remainder of the Term and (ii) submit all payments of Monthly Base Rent via cashiers check or wire transfer. Further, in the event any check submitted by Tenant is returned by reason of non sufficient funds, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an NSF Fee at Landlords standard and reasonable rate then in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord will not assess a late charge until Landlord has given written notice of such late payment for the first late payment in any twelve (12) month period and after Tenant has not cured such late payment within three (3) business days from receipt of such notice. No other notices will be required during the following twelve (12) months for a late charge to be incurred.</p>
          <p id="s1p403">(g) Rights and Remedies Cumulative. All rights, options and remedies of Landlord contained in this Lease will be construed and held to be cumulative, and no one of them will be exclusive of the other, and Landlord shall have the right to pursue anyone or all of such remedies or any other remedy or relief which may be provided by law or in equity, whether or not stated in this Lease. Nothing in this Section 21 will be deemed to limit or otherwise affect Tenants indemnification of Landlord pursuant to any provision of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p404">22. LANDLORDS DEFAULT.</p>
          <p id="s1p405">(a) Landlords Default. Landlord will not be in default in the performance of any obligation required to be performed by Landlord under this Lease unless Landlord fails to perform such obligation within a reasonable time, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the receipt of written notice from Tenant specifying in detail Landlords failure to perform; providedhowever, that if the nature of Landlords obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for performance, then Landlord will not be deemed in default if it commences such performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently pursues the same to completion.</p>
          <p id="s1p406">(b) Tenants Self-Help Right. If following the Commencement Date, Tenant provides written notice to Landlord of an event or circumstance which requires the action of Landlord with respect to repair, maintenance and/or replacement obligations of Landlord under the terms of this Lease, then if Landlord fails to take the necessary corrective action to perform the work or take the action Landlord is required to perform under the Lease within a reasonable period of time, given the circumstances, after the receipt of such notice, but in any event not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice (unless such repair is reasonably expected to take longer than thirty (30) days and Landlord has commenced such work within said 30-day period and diligently prosecutes such work to completion), then Tenant may proceed to take the</p>

If such action was required under the terms of this Lease to be taken by Landlord and is not taken by Landlord within said 5-day period, then Tenant shall be entitled to take such action and to receive reimbursement from Landlord for all reasonable and actual out-of-pocket costs and expense incurred by Tenant in connection with such action (, which out-of-pocket costs are referred to herein as the Reimbursement Amount). In the event Tenant takes such action, and such work will affect the Building Systems or Building Structure, Tenant shall use only those contractors used by Landlord in the Building for work on such systems or structure unless such contractors are unwilling or unable to perform, or timely perform, such work at a commercially reasonable cost, in which event Tenant may utilize the services of any other qualified contractor which normally and regularly performs similar work in comparable buildings. Promptly following completion of any work completed by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Section 22(b), Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a detailed statement of the work completed (including a detailed schedule of Tenants costs of taking such action which Tenant claims should have been taken by Landlord), the materials used, and all invoices evidencing the cost of work, together with proof of payment by Tenant. If Landlord does not deliver a detailed written objection to Tenant, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such detailed information from Tenant regarding the work and the Reimbursement Amount, then Tenant shall be entitled to deduct from rent payable by Tenant under this Lease, the amount set forth in such invoice as the Reimbursement Amount. If, however, Landlord delivers to Tenant within ten (10) business days after receipt of Tenants invoice, a written objection to the payment of such invoice, setting forth with reasonable particularity Landlords reasons for its claim that such action did not have to be taken by Landlord pursuant to the terms of this Lease or that the charges claimed as a Reimbursement Amount are unreasonably excessive (in which case Landlord shall pay the amount it contends would not have been unreasonably excessive), and if Landlord and Tenant are unable to resolve such dispute within ten (10) business days after Tenants receipt of such written objection from Landlord, either party may submit such dispute to binding arbitration according to the then rules of commercial arbitration as referenced in Section 40 below. If such dispute is so submitted to arbitration, Tenant shall not be permitted any such offset of the disputed amount against rent unless and until any such arbitration proceedings are concluded in Tenants favor. The costs of any such arbitration shall be paid to the prevailing party as determined by the arbitrator, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Tenant is prevented from instituting an arbitration proceeding because of the existence of the automatic stay under applicable bankruptcy law, then notwithstanding the foregoing provisions to the contrary, Tenant shall have the right to proceed to offset the disputed amount against Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease without proceeding to arbitration.</p>
          <p id="s1p414">23. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.</p>
          <p id="s1p415">(a) Restriction on Transfer. Except as expressly provided in this Section 23, Tenant will not, either voluntarily or by operation of law, assign or encumber this Lease or any interest herein or sublet the Premises or any part thereof, or permit the use or occupancy of the Premises by any party other than Tenant (any such assignment, encumbrance, sublease or the like will sometimes be referred to as a Transfer), without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent Landlord will not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. It is further understood that any renewal, extension or modification of an existing sublease shall also require Landlords prior written consent, which Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p416">(b) Corporate and Partnership Transfers. For purposes of this Section 23, if Tenant is a corporation, partnership or other entity, any transfer, assignment, encumbrance or hypothecation of fifty percent (50%) or more (in one or a series of related transactions) of any stock or other ownership interest in such entity, and/or any transfer, assignment, hypothecation or encumbrance of any controlling ownership or controlling voting interest in such entity, will be deemed a Transfer and will be subject to all of the restrictions and provisions contained in this Section 23. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the immediately preceding sentence will not apply to any change in the controlling ownership interest of the entity that constitutes Tenant which results from any of the following: (i) the infusion of additional equity capital in Tenant or an initial public offering of equity securities of Tenant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which results in Tenants stock being traded on a national securities exchange, including, but not limited to, the NYSE, the NASDAQ Stock Market or the NASDAQ Small Cap Market System; or (ii) any transfer or sale of the stock or other ownership interest in Tenant (1) to the spouse(s) and/or children of a shareholder of Tenant, (2) to any trust, the beneficiary(ies) of which are family members of a shareholder of Tenant, (3) by reason of bequest or inheritance, or (4) in connection with the issuance of warrants or stock options to purchase Tenants stock, and the exercise of any purchase rights under any such warrants or stock options.</p>

          <p id="s1p424">(d) Transfer Notice. If Tenant desires to effect a Transfer, then at least thirty (30) days prior to the date when Tenant desires the Transfer to be effective (the Transfer Date), Tenant agrees to give Landlord a notice (the Transfer Notice), stating the name, address and business of the proposed assignee, sublessee or other transferee (sometimes referred to hereinafter as Transferee), reasonable information concerning the character, ownership, and financial condition of the proposed Transferee, the Transfer Date, any ownership or commercial relationship between Tenant and the proposed Transferee, and the consideration and all other material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer, all in such detail as Landlord may reasonably require. If Landlord reasonably requests additional detail, the Transfer Notice will not be deemed to have been received until Landlord receives such additional detail, and Landlord may withhold consent to any Transfer until such information is provided to it.</p>
          <p id="s1p425">(e) Landlords Options. Within thirty (30) days of Landlords receipt of any Transfer Notice, and any additional information requested by Landlord concerning the proposed Transferees financial responsibility, Landlord will elect by written notice to Tenant to do one of the following: (i) consent to the proposed Transfer; (ii) refuse such consent, which refusal shall be on reasonable grounds including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 23(f) below; or (iii) in the case of an assignment of Tenants interest in this Lease or an assignment of this Lease or sublease of more than fifty percent (50%) of the original Premises for substantially the remainder of the Term to any party other than a Transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer, terminate this Lease as to all or such portion of the Premises which is proposed to be sublet or assigned and recapture all or such portion of the Premises for reletting by Landlord, subject to and in accordance with Section 23(i) below.</p>
          <p id="s1p426">(f) Reasonable Disapproval. Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge that Landlords disapproval of any proposed Transfer pursuant to Section 23(e) above will be deemed reasonable if based upon any reasonable factor, including, without limitation, any or all of the following factors: (i) the proposed Transferee is a governmental entity; (ii) the use of the Premises by the Transferee (A) is not permitted by the use provisions in Section 7 hereof, or (B) poses a material risk of substantial increased liability to Landlord; or (iii) the Transferee does not have the financial capability to fulfill the obligations imposed by the Transfer and the applicable provisions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p427">(g) Additional Conditions. A condition to Landlords consent to any Transfer of this Lease will be the delivery to Landlord of a true copy of the fully executed instrument of assignment, sublease, transfer or hypothecation, and, in the case of an assignment, the delivery to Landlord of an agreement executed by the Transferee in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, whereby the Transferee assumes and agrees to be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Lease and to perform all of the obligations of Tenant thereafter first accruing hereunder. As a condition for granting its consent to any assignment or sublease, Landlord may require that upon any default by Tenant hereunder (beyond any applicable notice and cure periods) the assignee or sublessee shall remit directly to Landlord on a monthly basis, all monies due to Tenant by said assignee or sublessee. As a condition to Landlords consent to any sublease, such sublease must provide that it is subject and subordinate to this Lease and to all mortgages; that Landlord may enforce the provisions of the sublease, including collection of</p>

          <p id="s1p435">(h) Excess Rent. If Landlord consents to any assignment of this Lease, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, as additional rent, fifty percent (50%) of all sums and other consideration actually paid to and for the benefit of Tenant by the assignee on account of the assignment, as and when such sums and other consideration are paid by the assignee to or for the benefit of Tenant (or, if Landlord so requires, and without any release of Tenants liability for the same, Tenant agrees to instruct the assignee to pay fifty percent (50%) of such sums and other consideration directly to Landlord). If for any sublease, Tenant receives rent or other consideration, either initially or over the term of the sublease, in excess of the rent fairly allocable to the portion of the Premises which is subleased based on square footage, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord as additional rent, fifty percent (50%) of the excess of each such payment of rent or other consideration received by Tenant promptly after its receipt. In calculating excess rent or other consideration which may be payable to Landlord under this paragraph, Tenant will be entitled to deduct commercially reasonable third party brokerage commissions and attorneys fees, tenant improvement construction costs, free rent, the fair market value of any goods or services provided by Tenant as additional consideration, and other amounts reasonably and actually expended by Tenant in connection with such assignment or subletting. Upon request, Tenant will provide reasonable evidence of such expenditures to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p436">(i) Termination Rights. If Tenant requests Landlords consent to any assignment of the Lease, or a sublease of more than fifty percent (50%) of the original Premises for the entire remainder of the Term, Landlord will have the right, as provided in Section 23(e) above, to terminate this Lease as to all or such portion of the Premises which is proposed to be sublet or assigned effective as of the date Tenant proposes to sublet or assign as set forth herein. Landlords consent to any sublease or assignment by Tenant shall not affect any rights of Landlord under this Section 23(i) with respect to any future sublease or assignment meeting the criteria set forth herein. Landlord will exercise such termination right, if at all, by giving written notice to Tenant within thirty (30) days of receipt by Landlord of the financial responsibility information required by this Section 23. Tenant understands and acknowledges that the option, as provided in this Section 23, to terminate this Lease as to all or such portion of the Premises which is proposed to be sublet or assigned rather than approve the subletting or assignment of all or a portion of the Premises, is a material inducement for Landlords agreeing to lease the Premises to Tenant upon the terms and conditions herein set forth. In the event of any such termination with respect to less than all of the Premises, the cost of segregating the recaptured space from the balance of the Premises will be paid by Landlord and Tenants future monetary obligations under this Lease will be reduced proportionately on a square footage basis to correspond to the balance of the Premises which Tenant continues to lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing , if Landlord elects to exercise its termination rights under this Section 23(i), then Tenant, within ten (10) days after its receipt of Landlords notice of such termination, may notify Landlord in writing that Tenants elects to rescind the proposed Transfer, in which event the Transfer and such termination shall be deemed null and void and this Lease shall remain unchanged and otherwise in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p437">(j) No Release. No Transfer will release Tenant of Tenants obligations under this Lease or alter the primary liability of Tenant to pay the rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Tenant hereunder. Landlord may require during any period of time that Tenant is in default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods) under this Lease that any Transferee remit directly to Landlord on a monthly basis, all monies due Tenant by said Transferee. However, the acceptance of rent by Landlord from any other person will not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision hereof. Consent by Landlord to one Transfer will not be deemed consent to any subsequent Transfer. In the event of default by any Transferee of Tenant or any successor of Tenant in the performance of any of the terms hereof, Landlord may proceed directly against Tenant without the necessity of exhausting remedies against such Transferee or successor. Landlord may consent to subsequent assignments of this Lease or sublettings or amendments or modifications to this Lease with assignees of Tenant, upon notice to Tenant, or any successor of Tenant, but without obtaining its or their consent thereto and any such actions will not relieve Tenant of liability under this Lease.</p>

If Tenant effects a Transfer (other than a Permitted Transfer) or requests the consent of Landlord to any Transfer (whether or not such Transfer is consummated), then, upon demand, Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord an administrative fee of $500.00 plus any reasonable, out-of-pocket attorneys and paralegal fees incurred by Landlord in connection with such Transfer or request for consent; provided, however, Landlord agrees that so long as Landlords standard form of consent document is utilized and such consent document is reasonably negotiated with no more than two (2) drafts of the consent document circulated, the total fees charged to Tenant for a consent request will not exceed $2,500.00. Reimbursement of Landlords attorneys and paralegal fees will in no event obligate Landlord to consent to any proposed Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p445">24. SUBORDINATION. Without the necessity of any additional document being executed by Tenant for the purpose of effecting a subordination, and at the election of Landlord or any mortgagee or beneficiary with a deed of trust encumbering the Premises, or any lessor of a ground or underlying lease with respect to the Premises, this Lease will be subject and subordinate at all times to: (a) all ground leases or underlying leases which may now exist or hereafter be executed affecting the Premises; and (b) the lien of any mortgage or deed of trust which may now exist or hereafter be executed for which the Premises, or Landlords interest and estate in any of said items, is specified as security (collectively, Mortgages, and individually, a Mortgage). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord reserves the right to subordinate any such ground leases or underlying leases or any such liens to this Lease. If any such ground lease or underlying lease terminates for any reason or any such mortgage or deed of trust is foreclosed or a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure is made for any reason, at the election of Landlords successor in interest, Tenant agrees to attorn to and become the tenant of such successor in which event Tenants right to possession of the Premises will not be disturbed as long as Tenant is not in default (beyond any applicable notice and cure periods) under this Lease. Tenant hereby waives its rights under any law which gives or purports to give Tenant any right to terminate or otherwise adversely affect this Lease and the obligations of Tenant hereunder in the event of any such foreclosure proceeding or sale. Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver, promptly upon demand by Landlord and in the form reasonably required by Landlord, any additional documents evidencing the priority or subordination of this Lease and Tenants attornment agreement with respect to any such ground lease or underlying leases or the lien of any such mortgage or deed of trust. If Tenant fails to sign and return any such documents within ten (10) days of receipt, and such default continues for five (5) business days after Tenants receipt of a second written notice from Landlord, Tenant will be in default hereunder. Landlord represents and warrants that there are no Mortgages encumbering the Building or Premises as of the date of this Lease, except as set forth in that certain policy of title insurance dated [ ], 2011 (policy no. [ ]). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Lease: (i) Tenants obligations under this Lease shall be conditioned on its receipt of a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement (SNDA) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F; and (ii) with respect to any Mortgage entered into by Landlord following the date of this Lease, Tenants agreement to subordinate its interest under this Lease to the lien of any such future Mortgage shall be subject to receiving an SNDA in a commercially reasonable form from the holder of such Mortgage that Tenants possession of the Premises and this Lease, including any option to extend the Term hereof, will not be disturbed so long as Tenant is not then in default (beyond any applicable notice and cure periods) and Tenant attorns to the record owner of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p446">25. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE. Within ten (10) days following any written request which Landlord may make from time to time, Tenant agrees to execute and deliver to Landlord a statement, in a form similar to the form of Exhibit C attached hereto or in such other commercially reasonable form as may be required by Landlords lender, certifying: (i) the date of commencement of this Lease; (ii) whether this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full force and effect, and stating the date and nature of such modifications); (iii) the date to which the rent and other sums payable under this Lease have been paid; (iv) whether there are any known current defaults under this Lease by either Landlord or Tenant; and (v) such other matters reasonably requested by Landlord. Landlord and Tenant intend that any statement delivered pursuant to this Section 25 may be relied upon by any mortgagee, beneficiary, purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Premises or any interest therein. Tenants failure to deliver such statement within such time, when such failure continues for five (5) days after Tenants receipt of a second written request from Landlord, will be conclusive upon Tenant (i) that this Lease is in full force and effect, without modification except as may be represented by Landlord, (ii) that there are no uncured defaults in Landlords performance, and (iii) that not more than one (1) months rent has been paid in advance. Without limiting the foregoing, if Tenant fails to deliver any such statement within such ten (10) day period, Landlord may deliver to Tenant an additional request for such statement and Tenants failure to deliver such statement to Landlord within five (5) days after delivery of such additional request will constitute a default under this Lease. Tenant agrees to</p>

          <p id="s1p454">26. EASEMENTS. Landlord reserves to itself the right, from time to time, to grant such easements, rights and dedications that Landlord deems necessary or desirable, and to cause the recordation of parcel maps and restrictions, so long as such easements, rights, dedications, maps and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with the access to and use of the Premises by Tenant and Tenants parking rights. Tenant shall promptly sign any of the aforementioned documents upon request of Landlord and failure to do so beyond the applicable notice and cure period shall constitute a material breach of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p455">27. RULES AND REGULATIONS. Tenant agrees to faithfully observe and comply with the Rules and Regulations, a copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference as Exhibit D, and all reasonable and nondiscriminatory modifications thereof and additions thereto from time to time put into effect by Landlord. To the extent there is inconsistency between such rules and regulations and the other provisions of this Lease, the other provisions of this Lease shall govern and control.</p>
          <p id="s1p456">28. MODIFICATION AND CURE RIGHTS OF LANDLORDS MORTGAGEES AND LESSORS. If, in connection with Landlords obtaining or entering into any financing or ground lease affecting the Premises, the lender or ground lessor requests modifications to this Lease, Tenant, within ten (10) days after request therefor, agrees to execute an amendment to this Lease incorporating such modifications, provided such modifications are reasonable and do not increase the obligations of Tenant under this Lease, shorten or lengthen the Term, or otherwise adversely affect the leasehold estate created by this Lease. In the event of any default on the part of Landlord, Tenant will give notice by registered or certified mail to any beneficiary of a deed of trust or mortgage covering the Premises or ground lessor of Landlord whose address has been furnished to Tenant, and Tenant agrees to offer such beneficiary, mortgagee or ground lessor a reasonable opportunity to cure the default, as long as Tenants use and enjoyment of the Premises is not materially impaired during such period.</p>
          <p id="s1p457">29. DEFINITION OF LANDLORD. The term Landlord, as used in this Lease, so far as covenants or obligations on the part of Landlord are concerned, means and includes only the owner or owners, at the time in question, of the fee title of the Premises or the lessees under any ground lease, if any. In the event of any transfer, assignment or other conveyance or transfers of any such title (other than a transfer for security purposes only), Landlord herein named (and in case of any subsequent transfers or conveyances, the then grantor) will be automatically relieved from and after the date of such transfer, assignment or conveyance of all liability as respects the performance of any covenants or obligations on the part of Landlord contained in this Lease first accruing and thereafter to be performed, so long as the transferee assumes in writing (or is otherwise obligated as a matter of law with respect to obligations that run with the land) all such covenants and obligations of Landlord arising after the date of such transfer. Landlord and Landlords transferees and assignees have the absolute right to transfer all or any portion of their respective title and interest in the Premises and/or this Lease without the consent of Tenant, and such transfer or subsequent transfer will not be deemed a violation on Landlords part of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease. In any event, the obligations of Landlord hereunder shall be limited to its actual period of ownership of title to the Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p458">30. WAIVER. The waiver by either party of any breach of any term, covenant or condition herein contained will not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition herein contained, nor will any custom or practice which may develop between the parties in the administration of the terms hereof be deemed a waiver of or in any way affect the right of either party to insist upon performance in strict accordance with said terms. The subsequent acceptance of rent or any other payment hereunder by Landlord will not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by Tenant of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease, other than the failure of Tenant to pay the particular rent so accepted, regardless of Landlords knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such rent. No acceptance by Landlord of a lesser sum than the basic rent and additional rent or other sum then due will be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest installment of such rent or other amount due, nor will any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlords right to recover the balance of such installment or other amount or pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease. The consent or approval of Landlord to or of any act by Tenant requiring Landlords consent or approval will not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary Landlords consent or approval to or of any subsequent similar acts by Tenant.</p>

Tenant shall have the right to use all of the onsite parking spaces for the Building, at no cost throughout the Term (including any extension or renewal thereof). Landlord reserves the right from time to time to modify and/or adopt reasonable and non-discriminatory rules and regulations for the parking areas as it deems reasonably necessary for the operation of the parking areas.</p>
          <p id="s1p466">32. FORCE MAJEURE. If either Landlord or Tenant is delayed, hindered in or prevented from the performance of any act required under this Lease by reason of strikes, lock-outs, labor troubles, inability to procure standard materials, failure of power, restrictive governmental laws, regulations or orders or governmental action or inaction (including failure, refusal or delay in issuing permits, approvals and/or authorizations which is not the result of the action or inaction of the party claiming such delay), riots, civil unrest or insurrection, war, fire, earthquake, flood or other natural disaster, unusual and unforeseeable delay which results from an interruption of any public utilities (e.g., electricity, gas, water, telephone) or other unusual and unforeseeable delay not within the reasonable control of the party delayed in performing work or doing acts required under the provisions of this Lease (collectively, Force Majeure Events), then performance of such act will be excused for the period of the delay and the period for the performance of any such act will be extended for a period equivalent to the period of such delay. The provisions of this Section 32 will not operate to excuse Tenant or Landlord from prompt payment of rent or any other payments required under the provisions of this Lease, nor will such provisions extend the time that Tenant may be entitled to an abatement of rent or to terminate this Lease pursuant to any express abatement right or termination provision contained in this Lease. As referenced herein, an Act of God Force Majeure Delay shall mean a Force Majeure Event which arises out of an act of God, such as fire, flood, earthquake or other casualty or by reason of acts of war or terrorism (but not for any other Force Majeure Events). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Landlord Delay or an Act of God Force Majeure Delay shall postpone the Lease Commencement Date only in the event that substantial completion of the Tenant Improvements in the Premises is actually delayed despite Tenants commercially reasonable efforts to adapt and compensate for such delays.</p>

Subject to the approval of all applicable governmental and quasi-governmental entities and applicable covenants, conditions and restrictions, and subject to all Legal Requirements and the terms hereof, Landlord hereby grants Tenant the right to install and maintain one (1) exterior sign on top of each Building comprising the Premises bearing Tenants name (the Exterior Signage). The design, size, specifications, graphics, materials, manner of affixing, exact location, colors and lighting (if applicable) of the Exterior Signage shall be (i) consistent with the quality and appearance of the Premises, and (ii) subject to the approval of all applicable governmental authorities, and Landlords approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Tenant shall install, maintain and repair the Exterior Signage at Tenants sole cost and expense. In addition, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after demand, from time to time, all other actual, documented and reasonable costs incurred by Landlord attributable to the fabrication, installation, insurance, lighting (if applicable), maintenance and repair of the Exterior Signage, to the extent not directly paid by Tenant. The signage rights granted to Tenant under this Section 33.a may only be exercised by the named Tenant hereunder executing this Lease (the Original Tenant), and may not be exercised or used by or assigned to any other person or entity other than a Transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer or a Transferee approved by Landlord that will be occupying more than fifty percent (50%) of the Premises, or in the case of individual building signage, a transferee that will be occupying more than fifty percent (50%) of the building at issue (but in no event may any Exterior Signage reflect an Objectionable Name which shall mean any name which relates to an entity which is of a character or reputation, or which is associated with an activity, action, political orientation or faction, which is inconsistent with the quality of the Project, or which would otherwise reasonably offend a landlord or tenant of buildings comparable to and in the vicinity of the Project). Further, Tenants signage rights shall be conditioned upon this Lease being in fully force and effect, and Tenant leasing more than fifty percent (50%) of the Building pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, or upon the earlier termination of Tenants signage right under this Section 33(a) Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove the Exterior Signage from the Building and repair all damage to the Building resulting from such removal and restore the affected area to its original condition existing prior to the installation of such Exterior Signage, ordinary wear and tear and damage by casualty excepted. If Tenant fails to complete such removal and/or repair any damage caused by the removal of the Exterior Signage (including patching and painting with matching paint, as necessary), Landlord shall have the right to do so, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the reasonable costs thereof.</p>

In consideration of the benefits accruing hereunder, Tenant on behalf of itself and all successors and assigns of Tenant covenants and agrees that, in the event of any actual or alleged failure, breach or default hereunder by Landlord: (a) Tenants recourse against Landlord for monetary damages will be limited to Landlords interest in the Premises including, subject to the prior rights of any mortgagee, Landlords interest in the rents of the Premises and any condemnation and insurance proceeds payable to Landlord; (b) except as may be necessary to secure jurisdiction of Landlord, no member or partner of Landlord shall be sued or named as a party in any suit or action and no service of process shall be made against any member or partner of Landlord; (c) no member or partner of Landlord shall be required to answer or otherwise plead to any service of process; (d) no judgment will be taken against any member or partner of Landlord and any judgment taken against any member or partner of Landlord may be vacated and set aside at any time after the fact; (e) no writ of execution will be levied against the assets of any member or partner of Landlord; (f) the obligations under this Lease do not constitute personal obligations of the individual members, partners, directors, officers or shareholders of Landlord, and Tenant shall not seek recourse against the individual members, partners, directors, officers or shareholders of Landlord or any of their personal assets for satisfaction of any liability in respect to this Lease; and (g) these covenants and agreements are enforceable both by Landlord and also by any member or partner of Landlord. In connection with any sale or transfer of the Premises by the Landlord under this Lease, the entity comprising the selling or transferring Landlord shall not wind up or dissolve or distribute insurance, condemnation or sales proceeds (Owner Proceeds) except in compliance with applicable Legal Requirements, including providing for any contingent liabilities of Landlord in accordance with the terms of applicable Legal Requirements. Accordingly, Tenant shall not be entitled to recover against any third parties any Owner Proceeds which were distributed by Landlord in compliance with applicable Legal Requirements (but may seek Owner Proceeds from a third party on the grounds that such third party obtained such proceeds from Landlord when Landlord was insolvent or in a transfer that was preferential or fraudulent as to Landlords creditors).</p>

Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Lease, Landlord and Tenant shall mutually approve a detailed space plan equivalent to one hundred percent (100%) complete design development documents for the construction of the Tenant Improvements. During the course of completion of the design development documents, Landlord and Tenant shall communicate and exchange information (with each other and the Architect) and shall cooperate with each other to achieve mutually satisfactory design development documents.

Additionally, the Final Working Drawings shall incorporate modifications to the Final Space Plan as necessary to comply with the floor load and other structural and system requirements of the Building. Tenant shall approve or reasonably disapprove the Final Working Drawings or any revisions thereto within five (5) business days after Landlord delivers the Final Working Drawings or any revisions thereto to Tenant; provided, however, that Tenant may only disapprove the Final Working Drawings to the extent the same does not (subject to changes reasonably required by Landlord) represent the logical evolution of the Final Space Plan (Working Drawing Design Problem). Tenants failure to approve or reasonably disapprove the Final Working Drawings or any revisions thereto by written notice to Landlord (which notice shall specify in detail the reasonable reasons for Tenants disapproval pertaining to any Working Drawing Design Problem) within said five (5) business day period shall be deemed to constitute Tenants approval of the Final Working Drawings or such revisions.

          <p id="s1p625">3.4 Approved Working Drawings.

Attached hereto as Exhibit G is a Project Schedule setting forth the reasonably projected time frames for each phase of the design and construction of the Tenant Improvements pursuant to this Work Letter (as it may be supplemented and updated from time to time, the Project Schedule). In connection with finalizing the Approved Working Drawings and following selection of a Contractor, Landlord will cause to be prepared and delivered to Tenant a detailed schedule of the construction phases of the Project Schedule reflecting the reasonably projected time to construct the improvements specified in the Approved Working Drawings, and as the work progresses Landlord shall cause Contractor and/or Architect to promptly notify Landlord and Tenant of any necessary modification of the Project Schedule based upon revisions of the scope or nature of the work, events or occurrences or other factors affecting the expected time for completion, and shall issue a revised Project Schedule.</p>

A qualified and experienced licensed general contractor, under the supervision of Landlord and selected by Landlord (with Tenants prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), shall construct the Tenant Improvements (the Contractor). Landlord and Tenant confirm and agree that South Bay Construction has been selected to complete certain pre-construction work relating to the Tenant Improvements. The following three (3) qualified and licensed contractors have been mutually selected to competitively bid the work necessary to complete the Tenant Improvements: Skyline Construction, XL Construction and South Bay Construction, and an additional mutually approved non-union contractor shall also be invited to submit a bid for the construction of the Tenant Improvements. Following receipt of the bids from each of these four (4) contractors, Landlord and Tenant shall mutually agree upon and select the Contractor to complete the Tenant Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p640">4.2 Pre- Construction Work: Cost Proposal. Tenant hereby authorizes Landlord to proceed with the necessary design and permitting work in order to prepare for completion of the Tenant Improvements, and confirms that Landlord may charge the soft costs incurred in completing such preliminary work against the Tenant Improvement Allowance in an amount not to exceed $5.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises. After the Approved Working Drawings are signed by Landlord and Tenant and the Contractor has been selected, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a final cost proposal in accordance with the Approved Working Drawings, which cost proposal shall include the reasonably projected cost of all Tenant Improvement Allowance Items to be incurred in connection with the design, permitting and construction of the Tenant Improvements (the Cost Proposal). Tenant shall provide Landlord with notice approving or disapproving the Cost Proposal within five (5) business days of the receipt of the same. If Tenant disapproves the Cost Proposal, Tenants notice of disapproval shall be accompanied by proposed revisions to the Approved Working Drawings that Tenant requests in order to resolve its objections to the Cost Proposal. Landlord and Tenant shall promptly meet and confer and negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve any dispute they may have in connection with the Cost Proposal. Based upon the approved Cost Proposal, Landlord will enter into a construction contract with Contractor on a stipulated sum basis (Construction Contract), which Construction Contract shall also set forth a projected date for Substantial Completion of the Tenant Improvements. Prior to execution and delivery of such stipulated sum construction contract with Contractor, Landlord shall provide to Tenant for review a copy of the proposed contract.</p>

Assignment of Rents</p>
          <p id="s1p930">5.. In the event of a foreclosure under the Deed of Trust, Lessee agrees for the benefit of Lender (including for this purpose any transferee of Lender or any transferee of Lessors title in and to the Property by Lenders exercise of the remedy of sale by foreclosure under the Deed of Trust) as follows: ATTORNMENT</p>

Lessee shall be bound to Lender in accordance with all of the provisions of the Lease for the balance of the term thereof, and Lessee hereby attorns to Lender as its landlord, such attornment to be effective and self-operative without the execution of any further instrument immediately upon Lender succeeding to Lessors interest in the Lease and giving written notice thereof to Lessee; Continuation of Performance</p>
          <p id="s1p933">5.3. Lender shall not be liable for, nor subject to, any offsets or defenses which Lessee may have by reason of any act or omission of Lessor under the Lease, nor for the return of any sums which Lessee may have paid to Lessor under the Lease as and for security deposits, advance rentals or otherwise, except to the extent that such sums are actually delivered by Lessor to Lender; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may exercise its self-help rights subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section 22(b) of the Lease so long as Lender is provided the opportunity to exercise all rights of Landlord under the terms of such Section 22(b), including without limitation, notice and cure rights prior to the exercise of any rental offset; and No Offset</p>
          <p id="s1p934">5.4.

In the event of a foreclosure under the Deed of Trust, so long as there shall then exist no default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods) on the part of Lessee under the Lease, Lender agrees for itself and its successors and assigns that the leasehold interest of Lessee under the Lease shall not be extinguished or terminated by reason of such foreclosure, but rather the Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct agreement between Lender, as landlord, and Lessee, as tenant, and Lender shall recognize and accept Lessee as tenant under the Lease subject to the terms and provisions of the Lease except as modified by this Agreement; NON-DISTURBANCEprovided, however, that Lessee and Lender agree that the following provisions of the Lease (if any) shall not be binding on Lender: any option to purchase with respect to the Property; any right of first refusal to purchase with respect to the Property.
