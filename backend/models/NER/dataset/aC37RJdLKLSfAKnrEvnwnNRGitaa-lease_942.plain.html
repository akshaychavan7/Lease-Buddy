LESSEE’s share of all the Common Facilities contribution, Taxes and insurance, shall be determined by totaling all of those costs and multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of square feet in the demised Premises and the denominator shall be the total number of gross leaseable square feet in the building.That figure is currently 61.7% and will remain the same unless the building area is expanded by LESSOR. LESSOR shall estimate the total yearly charge for Taxes, insurance and Common Facilities contribution charges and, based on one-twelfth of that estimated charge, LESSOR shall bill LESSEE for its estimated monthly charge upon commencement of the lease and at the end of each calendar year thereafter.
