Commencing with the second (2nd) Lease Year and continuing thereafter during the Term (excluding the first Lease Year of any Renewal Term), Tenant agrees to pay &quot;Additional Rent&quot; to Landlord monthly in advance together with the payment of Minimum Rent. Such Additional Rent (which shall be expressed as an annual amount but shall be payable in equal monthly insta llments) shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Additional Rent for the immediately preceding Lease Year and (ii) the product of the Minimum Rent and Additional Rent due for the immediately preceding Lease Year and the lesser of (A) three percent (3.0%), or (B) a</p>

          <p id="s1p11">(b) Concurrently with any increase or decrease in Landlord’s Investment during the Term as described in Section 2.2(a), the Minimum Rent and Additional Rent then due and payable for the balance of the applicable Lease Year and Term shall be recalculated and reset based on the adjusted Landlord’s Investment.</p>
          <p id="s1p12">2.3 Renewal Term Rent. To establish a fair market Minimum Rent for the Premises during the Renewal Terms, the Minimum Rent for each Renewal Term shall be reset and expressed as an annual amount equal to the greater of (a) the total of the Minimum Rent and Additional Rent due for the last Lease Year of the immediately preceding Term, multiplied by one hundred three percent (103.0%), or (b) the product of: (i) the &quot;Fair Market Value&quot; of the Premises on the Exercise Date as established pursuant to Exhibit C, and (ii) a percentage equal to fifty percent (50%) of the sum of (A) the immediately preceding twenty (20) day trading average of the Ten (10) Year U.S. Treasury Notes plus five hundred fifty (550) basis points, plus (B) the immediately preceding twenty (20) day average dividend yield on the common stock of Nationwide H ealth Properties, Inc. (&quot;NHP&quot;) plus two hundred (200) basis points. Commencing with the second (2nd) Lease Year and continuing thereafter during each Renewal Term, &quot;Additional Rent&quot; shall be due and payable and calculated as provided in Section 2.1.</p>
          <p id="s1p13">2.4 Rent Caps and Floors.</p>
          <p id="s1p14">(a) Notwithstanding any of the other terms of this Lease, in no event shall the Minimum Rent in the first (1st) Lease Year of any Renewal Term exceed one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the Minimum Rent and Additional Rent due for the last Lease Year of the Initial Term or preceding Renewal Term, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p15">14387.7 --</p>
          <p id="s1p16">(b) Notwithstanding any of the other terms of this Lease, in no event shall the Minimum Rent in the first (1st) Lease Year of any Renewal Term be less than one hundred three percent (103%) of the Minimum Rent and Additional Rent due fo r the last Lease Year of the Initial Term or preceding Renewal Term, as the case may be.</p>

All Rent payments shall be absolutely net to Landlord, free of any and all Taxes, Other Charges, and operating or other expenses of any kind whatsoever, all of which shall be paid by Tenant.

Thus, Tenant shall at all times remain obligated under this Lease withou t any right of set-off, counterclaim, abatement, deduction or reduction of any kind. Tenant’s sole right to recover damages against Landlord under this Lease shall be to prove such damages in a separate action.</p>
          <p id="s1p19">3. Late Charges. The late payment of Rent or other amounts due will cause Landlord to lose the use of such money and incur administrative and other expenses not contemplated under this Lease. While the exact amount of the foregoing is extremely difficult to ascertain, the parties agree that as a reasonable estimate of fa ir compensation to Landlord, if any Rent or other amount is not paid within (a) two (2) days after the due date for such payment, then Tenant shall thereafter pay to Landlord on demand a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of such delinquent amounts, and (b) five (5) days after the due date for such payment, such unpaid amount shall accrue interest from such date at the &quot;Agreed Rate&quot; of five percent (5%) FONT&gt;plus the prime rate of interest then charged by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., San Francisco, CA.</p>

Such monthly deposits shall be equal to five percent (5%) of the gross revenues generated by the Facilities for the calendar month immediately preceding the date of determination.</p>
          <p id="s1p29">(c) &quot;Rent Coverage Ratio&quot; means, as of the date of determination, the ratio of (i) the EBITDARM for the immediately preceding two calendar quarters, minus (A) an assumed management fee equal to five percent (5%) of the gross revenues generated during such two calendar quarters, and (B) the sum of One Hundred Twenty-Five Dollars ($125), multiplied by the aggregate number of licensed dementia care beds and assisted living units in the Facility and the Related Facilities, to (ii) the total amount of the Minimum Rent and Additional Rent due for the immediately preceding two calendar quarters pursuant to the terms of this Lease and the Related Leases.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord may exercise all rights and remedies under this Lease and the laws of the state where the Facility is located that are available to a lessor of real and personal property in the event of a default by its lessee, and as to the Tenant Property, all remedies granted under the laws of such state to a secured party under its Uniform Commercial Code. Landlord shall have no duty to mitigate damages unless required by applicable law and, abs ent gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not be responsible or liable for any failure to relet any of the Premises or to collect any rent due upon any such reletting. Tenant shall pay Landlord, immediately upon demand, all expenses incurred by it in obtaining possession and reletting any of the Premises, including fees, commissions and costs of attorneys, architects, agents and brokers.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">13.1 General.

          <p id="s1p110">13.2 Receivership. Tenant acknowledges that a Catastrophic Event of Default will materially and irreparably impair the value of Landlord’s investment in the Premises.

If Landlord commences the Receivership, the receiver shall be paid a reasonable fee for its services and all such fees and other expenses of the Receivership shall be paid in addition to, and not in limitation of, the Rent otherwise due to Landlord hereunder. Tenant irrevocably consents to the Receivership upon a Catastrophic Event of Default and thus stipulates to and agrees not to contest the appointment of a receiver under such circumstances and for such purposes.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">13.3 Remedies Cumulative; No Waiver. No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Landlord is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and each and every right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. Any notice or cure period provided herein shall run concurrently with any provided by applicable law. No failure of</p>

          <p id="s1p114">13.4 Performance of Tenant’s Obligations. If Tenant at any time shall fail to make any payment or perform any act on its part required to be made or performed under this Lease, then Landlord may, without waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligations or default hereunder, make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Tenant, and enter upon any portion of the Premises for the purpose of taking all such action as may be reasonably necessary. No such entry shall be deemed an eviction of Tenant. All sums so paid by Landlord and all necessary and incidental costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the performance of any such act by it, together with interest at the Agreed Rate from the date of the making of such payment or the incurring of such costs and expenses, shall be payable by Tenant to Landlord upon Landlord’s written demand therefor.</p>

If there is any Event of Default then existing, Tenant will not remove any Tenant Personal Property from the Premises and instead will, on demand from Landlord, convey it to Landlord for no additional consideration by executing a bill of sale in a form reasonably required by Landlord. Title to any Tenant Personal Property which is not removed by Tenant as permitted above upon the expiration of the Term shall, at Landlord’s election, vest in Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord may remove and store or dispose at Tenant’s expense any or all of such Tenant Personal Property which is not so removed by Tenant without obligation or accounting to Tenant.</p>

Commencing on the Termination Date, Landlord or its designee, upon written notice to Tenant, may elect to assume the responsibilities and obligations for the management and operation of the Business and Tenant agrees to cooperate fully to accomplish the transfer of such management and operation without interrupting the operation of the Business.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Section 17, Tenant shall not have any right under this Lease, and hereby waives all rights under applicable law, to abate, reduce or offset rent by reason of any damage or destruction of any portion of the Premises by reason of an insured or uninsured casualty. In the event any such damage or destruction occurs during the last six (6) months of the Initial Term or applicab le Renewal Term, to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of the replacement value of the Facility, Tenant may, at Tenant’s option to be evidenced by notice in writing given to Landlord within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such damage or destruction, elect to pay to Landlord any available insurance proceeds, including, without limitation, business interruption insurance proceeds described in Section 5.7, in which event this Lease shall terminate; provided, however, that if the available insurance proceeds are insufficient to cover the cost of the repair or reconstruction of the Facility, Tenant shall remain obligated to pay the additional cost to repair or reconstruct the Facility.</p>

Each party shall within ten (10) days after written demand by the other select one MAI Appraiser to participate in the determination of Fair Market Value. For all purposes under this Lease, the Fair Market Value shall be the fair market value of the Premises or applicable portion thereof unencumbered by this Lease. Within ten (10) days of such selection, the MAI Appraisers so selected by the parties shall select a third (3rd) MAI Appraiser. The three (3) selected MAI Appraisers shall each determine the Fair Market Value of the Premises or applicable portion thereof within thirty days of the selection of the third apprais er. To the extent consistent with sound appraisal practices as then existing at the time of any such appraisal, and if requested by Landlord, such appraisal shall be made on a basis consistent with the basis on which the Premises or applicable portion thereof were appraised at the time of their acquisition by Landlord. Tenant shall pay the fees and expenses of any MAI Appraiser retained pursuant to this Exhibit.</p>
          <p id="s1p203">If either party fails to select a MAI Appraiser within the time period set forth in the foregoing paragraph, the MAI Appraiser selected by the other party shall alone determine the fair market value of the Premises or applicable portion thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Exhibit and the Fair Market Value so determined shall be binding upon the parties. If the MAI Appraisers selected by the parties are unable to agree upon a third (3rd) MAI Appraiser within the time period set forth in the foregoing paragraph, either party shall have the right to apply at Tenant’s expense to the presiding judge of the court of original trial jurisdiction in the county in which the Premises or applicable portion thereof are located to name the third (3rd) MAI Appraiser.</p>
          <p id="s1p204">Within five(5) days after completion of the third (3rd) MAI Appraiser’s appraisal, all three (3) MAI Appraisers shall meet and a majority of the MAI Appraisers shall attempt to determine the fair market value of the Premises or applicable portion thereof. If a majority are unable to determine the fair market value at such meeting, the three (3) appraisals shall be added together and their total divided by three (3). The resulting quo tient shall be the Fair Market Value. If, however, either or both of the low appraisal or the high appraisal are more than ten percent (10%) lower or higher than the middle appraisal, any such lower or higher appraisal shall be disregarded. If only one (1) appraisal is disregarded, the remaining two (2) appraisals shall be added together and their total divided by two (2), and the resulting quotient shall be such Fair Market Value. If both the lower appraisal and higher appraisal are disregarded as provided herein, the middle appraisal shall be such Fair Market Value. In any event, the result of the foregoing appraisal process shall be final and binding.</p>
          <p id="s1p205">&quot;MAI Appraiser&quot; shall mean an appraiser licensed or otherwise qualified to do business in the state where the Premises is located and who has substantial experience in performing appraisals of facilities similar to the Premises or applicable portion thereof and is certified as a member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers or certified as a SRPA by the Society of Real Estate Appraisers, or, if such organizations no longer exist or certify appraisers, such successor organization or such other organization as is approved by Landlord.</p>

          <p id="s1p355">SCHEDULE 1</p>
          <p id="s1p356">EXCEPTIONS TO INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS</p>
          <p id="s1p357">1. Contrary to the requirements of Section 6.1, Emeritus provides its general and professional liability insurance through a captive insurance company domiciled in Hawaii and known as National Orion Insurance Company (&quot;NOI&quot;). NOI is not rated.</p>
          <p id="s1p358">2. Contrary to the requirements of Section 6.1, the general and professional liability insurance maintained by Tenant is on a claims made basis, not an occurrence basis.</p>
          <p id="s1p359">3. Contrary to the requirements of Section 6.1(a), damage to vehicles owned or leased by Tenant as well as damage to third party vehicles caused by Tenant is not covered by Tenant’s property insurance. Coverage for damage to third party vehicles may be available under certain circumstances under (i) the NOI policy, (ii) a personal auto policy purchased by an employee of Tenant for their own vehicle when used for company business or (iii) the Emeritus auto policy, which acts as an excess layer over an employee personal policy.</p>
          <p id="s1p360">4. Contrary to the requirements in Sections 6.1(b), (c) and (g), the general and professional liability insurance maintained by Tenant is subject to a $1 million per claim and $1,600,000 in the aggregate self insured retention amount and to a $ 4 million per claim and $4,800,000 aggregate limit on coverage.</p>
          <p id="s1p361">5. In Texas Emeritus has exercised its right under State law to opt out of the Workers Compensation system and instead to offer its employee an ERISA defined benefit plan which complies with the requirements of Texas law.</p>
          <p id="s1p362">6. Coverage for damages due to boiler and pressure vessels bursting or exploding is covered by Emeritus’ property insurance policy. However, the property insurance does not cover bodily injury or death resulting therefrom. Instead such claims would be covered under the general liability insurance policy provided by NOI.</p>
          <p id="s1p363">7. Emeritus’ business interruption insurance is provided under this property insurance policy and provides for loss of income for a period of 18 months.</p>
          <p id="s1p364">8. In addition to the exceptions noted in Section 4, above, the deductible under Emeritus’ property insurance for earthquake coverage is 5% with a $100,000 minimum in California, Hawaii and Alaska and a $100,000 in all other states. The deductible for storm and wind damage is 5% and 3%, respectively, or $100,000 in Tier 1 counties and all of Florida. The deductible for flood damage is 5% or $1,000,000 if the location is in Zone A or V. For all other flood damage the deductible is 5% or $100,000. All other property claims are subject to $50,000 deductible.</p>
