          <p id="s1p93">II. GENERAL CONDITIONS</p>
          <p id="s1p94">Article 1 — Object of the contract</p>
          <p id="s1p95">Landlord gives under lease to Tenant, which accepts, the premises defined in the special conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p96">The Leased Premises are perfectly well known to Tenant which does not request more extensive description. Tenant takes the Leased Premises as is and such being the case dispenses Landlord from the performance of any work as part of the delivery.</p>
          <p id="s1p97">The areas possibly indicated in the special conditions of this contract have been calculated according to the UGEB measurement code and are entered purely indicatively, and are not guaranteed, each party refraining from modifying the provisions of this contract and waiving any remedy against the other party if the real area should differ upwards or downwards from those mentioned therein.</p>
          <p id="s1p98">The shares mentioned in the special conditions of this contract are indicative and may be modified at any time by Landlord or the manager if justified by a modification of the structure, areas, equipment, or the use of certain parts of the building.</p>
          <p id="s1p99">Article 2 — Intended use of the Leased Premises</p>
          <p id="s1p100">The Leased Premises are for the exclusive use of offices and parking spaces more extensively specified in the special conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p101">No modification in the allocation of the Leased Premises may be made by Tenant without special prior written agreement of Landlord, in the modalities described in Article 12 of these general conditions, which Landlord may always refuse, without obligation to give any justification for such refusal, and without any remedy for Tenant concerning such refusal.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">Landlord reserves the right to give under lease other premises in the same building to other Tenants engaging or not in the same activity as Tenant, without being held liable for this reason.</p>
          <p id="s1p103">It is expressly specified that the Leased Premises may not be used in any case to engage in retail commerce or in the activity of an artisan directly in contact with the public, even if they are used as demonstration rooms, so that this lease is not and may never be governed by the law of April 30, 1951 on commercial leases.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">The parking spaces are exclusively intended for the parking of cars and small vans.</p>
          <p id="s1p105">Landlord reserves the right to modify or allow at any time the parking spaces designated if work, maintenance, security, or internal organization of the building so require.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">It is strictly prohibited to store merchandise in the parking spaces for washing or maintaining a vehicle.</p>
          <p id="s1p107">Since the Leased Premises hereunder are leased with all the easements they may have used or by which they are encumbered at the time of execution of this contract or which may encumber them afterwards to the extent of the constitution of new easements encumbering the Leased Premises proper and not the building overall, such constitution may take place only with prior written agreement of Tenant, which may withhold its agreement</p>
          <p id="s1p108">[initials]</p>
          <p id="s1p109">6/26</p>
          <p id="s1p110">other than for the fair reasons arising from the specific circumstances of its occupancy of the Leased Premises and not from the simple fact that the Leased Premises would be encumbered by an easement; the Tenant is not authorized to create easements on the Leased Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">The authorization given to Tenant to engage in certain activities does not imply, on the part of Landlord, any guarantee or diligence as to obtaining administrative authorizations that may be necessary under any status, and consequently Landlord may not be held liable in the event of refusal or delay in obtaining such authorizations, both at the time of entry in possession and during the entire term of the contractual relations.</p>
          <p id="s1p112">Tenant will consequently take upon itself, at its own expense, risk and peril, all administrative or other authorizations of any type for any equipment imposed by regulations and the payment of any amounts, royalties, taxes or other fees referring to the use of the Leased Premises and the activities carried out therein, both when taking possession of the Leased Premises and during the term of this contract and arising both from existing regulations and from any new regulations as well as all taxes, royalties or other fees existing or created after the signing of this contract.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">Article 3 — Term of the lease</p>
          <p id="s1p114">The lease is executed for the term defined in the special conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p115">The stay of Tenant in the Leased Premises beyond the contractual term will not constitute in any case tacit extension.</p>
          <p id="s1p116">If it results from factual unequivocal circumstances that each of the parties tacitly waived the exclusion of the tacit extension stipulated above, Tenant by not releasing the Leased Premises and Landlord by not opposing it, a new lease contract will be deemed to have been executed between the parties on a quarterly basis, each of the parties having the right to terminate it with notice of three months sent to the other party by registered letter mailed (whereby the parties expressly waive all their rights under article 1738 of the Civil Code).</p>
          <p id="s1p117">In addition, Landlord may terminate the lease contract at any time without notice by registered letter addressed to Tenant in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or petition for amicable or judicial agreement with creditors of Tenant. In such case, Tenant will owe Landlord the indemnities provided in Article 18 of these general conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">Article 4 — Rent</p>
          <p id="s1p119">The rent is payable by quarter in advance on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, in legal tender of Belgium, to the account indicated by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p120">The rent for the last period preceding the end of this contract will be calculated pro rata temporis.</p>
          <p id="s1p121">The rent is payable by mere lapse of the term, without prior notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">Article 5 — Adjustment clause</p>
          <p id="s1p123">The amount of the base rent provided in Article 4 of the special conditions is linked to the consumer price index (health) as published monthly by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">[initials]</p>
          <p id="s1p125">7/26</p>
          <p id="s1p126">On each anniversary date of the entry into effect of the lease contract, the rent will be proportionately adjusted automatically, based on the base index mentioned in Article 5 of the special conditions, according to this formula:</p>
          <p id="s1p127">ADAPTED RENT = BASE RENT X NEW INDEX</p>
          <p id="s1p128">BASE INDEX</p>
          <p id="s1p129">in which the new index is the one of the month preceding the anniversary of the effective date of the lease contract.</p>
          <p id="s1p130">Consequently, the modification of the index will automatically cause, without notice, a proportional adjustment of the rent, with the understanding that it will never fall below the last rent index ongoing on the adjustment date.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">It is expressly agreed that any waiver by Landlord of the increases resulting from this article may be established only by written recognition.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">As long as the provisions of Royal Decree of December 24, 1993 remain in force, both the base index and the new index will be replaced by the so-called “Health” index.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">If the calculation base of the official consumer price index is modified or the index is eliminated, the parties expressly agree that the amount of the rent will be the linked to the conversion rate published in the Moniteur Belge, or to any system replacing such index to serve as basis for the payment of State agents, but will never be lower than the last rent payable calculated according to the preceding method of the calculation of the index. In the absence of such a calculation system of the index for any reason whatsoever, Landlord will have the right to increase the rent in connection with the increase in the cost of living.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">The parties will do everything possible to agree on the use of a replacement formula.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">In the absence of agreement, the parties agree to submit any dispute concerning the replacement formula and the adjustment of the rent to arbitration as provided in Article 21 of these general conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p136">Article 6 — Charges</p>
          <p id="s1p137">A. Taxes and dues</p>
          <p id="s1p138">All general taxes, dues and contributions of any type, including in particular the real estate estimated tax or any other land taxes related to the Leased Premises, linked to the activity of Tenant or the occupancy of the Leased Premises or all taxes established by the State, the Region, the Community, the Province, the Federation of Communities or other public power, related to the occupancy of properties, the same as VAT, to the extent that it is charged to Tenant or to the extent that it is charged on rent, will be exclusively payable by Tenant under this contract. This list is not limited thereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p139">As an essential condition for the consent of Landlord on this contract, it is expressly agreed that if, for any reason, especially due to new legal or regulatory provisions or modifications from the existing provisions, Landlord has to itself pay all or part of taxes currently payable by Tenant (since the rent was not increased because of this reason), Landlord reserves the right to submit to Tenant an adjustment of the amount of rent, based on objective elements causing</p>
          <p id="s1p140">[initials]</p>
          <p id="s1p141">8/26</p>
          <p id="s1p142">the modification of the economic conditions of this contract, which lead to the need to increase the rent in order to maintain the economic balance of this contract, and the parties will decide together in good faith on the amount of such increase. In the absence of agreement, the parties will submit the issue of the increase of the rent authorized by this provision to an arbitrator according to the modalities provided in Article 21 of these general conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p143">Concerning the taxes/dues claimed by the Administration from Landlord and which are payable by Tenant under this contract, Tenant will have a term of fifteen days to pay them as of the receipt of the letter of Landlord or its representative, transmitting the request for payment of the Administration.</p>
          <p id="s1p144">Tenant must indemnify Landlord for fines, increases, interest and other penalties resulting from the absence of payment by Tenant or from the delay in payment of the taxes/dues payable by it.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">If the premises are divided into different land lots of the entire property or if the taxes are levied due to the occupancy of the Leased Premises or because of the activity carried out by Tenant, they will be paid by the latter directly to the competent Administration within the terms established by the latter so that Landlord is never bothered for this reason. Tenant will send proof of payment to Landlord without delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p146">If the Leased Premises are not divided into different land lots from the entire property or if for any other reason the taxes are calculated on the property in its entirety or on the part of the property, including the Leased Premises, Landlord will divide the taxes between all Tenants concerned, according to distribution criteria determined sovereignly by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">B. Charges for the common areas</p>
          <p id="s1p148">All general charges of any nature related to the occupancy of the premises as well as the maintenance and repair of the common areas and common equipment will be paid by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p149">Tenant will pay to Landlord or to the manager of the building its share of the common charges calculated according to the shared method, which includes in particular expenses related to:</p>
          <p id="s1p150">a) use, maintenance, repair, replacement and control of the various installations such as air conditioning, heating, toilets, electricity, elevators, access control, centralized management, smoke detection, firefighting means and devices, etc., including the fee related to the total guarantee;</p>
          <p id="s1p151">b) distribution of hot and cold water;</p>

          <p id="s1p155">f) salaries of the personnel hired for the correct operation of the building;</p>
          <p id="s1p156">[initials]</p>
          <p id="s1p157">9/26</p>

          <p id="s1p291">Tenant will be alone responsible for guarding and must ensure effective protection of the Leased Premises; it expressly exempts Landlord and its beneficiaries from any liability in case of theft or attack which may arise in the Leased Premises. Tenant may not claim any reduction of rent in case of termination of the guard or guards, if any, and it may not hold Landlord responsible for the acts committed by such guard or guards.</p>
          <p id="s1p292">In addition, it undertakes to bear all the consequences arising from any wrongful act occurring in the building, either alone if such act concerns only its private areas, or jointly with the other Tenants, if such act concerns the common areas.</p>

          <p id="s1p305">It is specified that only Landlord may exercise the right, in case of fault of Tenant, to request the cancellation for fault and the payment of said indemnity, whereby Tenant cannot use its own fault in order to impose a termination by its faults with payment of a termination indemnity; consequently, this article may not give grounds to Tenant, in any case, to terminate the lease contract against payment of the aforementioned indemnity above.</p>
