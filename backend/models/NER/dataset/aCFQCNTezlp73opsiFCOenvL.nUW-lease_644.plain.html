          <p id="s1p3">GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR LEASE OF OFFICE ACCOMMODATION</p>
          <p id="s1p4">and other commercial accommodation within the meaning of Article 7:230A of the Civil Code</p>
          <p id="s1p5">Model established by the Real Estate Council (ROZ) in July 2003, lodged with the Clerk of the Court in The Hague on 11 July 2003 and registered there under number 72/2003. All liability for detrimental consequences of the use of the text of this model is hereby excluded by the ROZ.</p>
          <p id="s1p6">Extent of the Subjects</p>
          <p id="s1p7">1.</p>
          <p id="s1p8">The expression “the Subjects” shall also be taken to include the systems and provisions within the Subjects, insofar as they are not excluded in the report on transfer annexed to and initialled by the parties as relative to this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p9">Condition</p>
          <p id="s1p10">2.</p>
          <p id="s1p11">At the start of the Lease the Subjects are or shall be delivered to and accepted by the Tenant in their then existing condition. That condition shall be established in a dated report on transfer annexed as an appendix to and initialled by the parties as relative to the Lease and forming part of the Lease. If no report on transfer is prepared at the start of the Lease, then the Subjects will be considered to have been transferred to and accepted by the Tenant in the condition which the Tenant might expect from a well-maintained property of the type to which the Lease relates.</p>
          <p id="s1p12">Defects</p>
          <p id="s1p13">3.</p>
          <p id="s1p14">It shall be considered that there is a defect in the Subjects if, taking account of their condition or any characteristic or other circumstance not attributable to the Tenant, the Tenant cannot enjoy the use of the Subjects at the commencement of the Lease which it might expect to enjoy.</p>
          <p id="s1p15">Inspection in connection with suitability</p>
          <p id="s1p16">4.</p>
          <p id="s1p17">The Tenant shall be obliged to carry out a thorough inspection of the Subjects before the commencement of the Lease in order to confirm that the Subjects are suitable or can be rendered suitable by the Tenant for the purposes intended. The Landlord has not investigated the suitability of the Subjects and shall only be bound to draw the Tenant’s attention to defects known to the Landlord and which the Landlord knows would negatively affect their suitability. The Landlord shall not be liable for the consequences of defects of which it was not and ought not to have been aware.</p>
          <p id="s1p18">Expertise</p>
          <p id="s1p19">5.</p>
          <p id="s1p20">If the Tenant or the Landlord is not sufficiently expert, then it/they shall be obliged to have an expert present or be represented by an expert when the report on transfer is made up and at the inspection referred to in Clause 4.</p>
          <p id="s1p21">Use</p>
          <p id="s1p22">6.1</p>
          <p id="s1p23">The Tenant shall use the Subjects during the whole term of the Lease actively, properly and personally exclusively for the purpose indicated in the Lease and paying due attention to existing restricted rights and any requirements imposed or to be imposed (including requirements relating to the Tenant’s business, the use of the Subjects and everything present within the Subjects) by the government or utility companies. The Tenant shall furnish and stock the Subjects adequately at the start of the Lease. The Tenant shall keep the Subjects fully furnished and stocked. The term “utility companies”, when used in this Lease, shall also include similar organisations whose business it is to supply, deliver and meter the use of energy, water, etcetera.</p>
          <p id="s1p24">6.2</p>
          <p id="s1p25">The Tenant shall comply with statutory provisions and local ordinances as well as normal commercial practice in relation to leases, government, utility company and insurance company provisions. The Tenant may only employ businesses in connection with carrying out work relating to security, fire-prevention and lift engineering if the Landlord has issued its approval of those businesses in advance and if the businesses are recognised by the National Prevention Centre (NCP) or the Netherlands Institute of Lift Engineers. The Tenant may not have the aforementioned type of work carried out itself, if that type of work is included in the context of supplies and services to be arranged and commissioned by the Landlord. The Tenant shall at all times observe the conditions of use issued by these businesses. Likewise, the Tenant shall take account of all verbal or written instructions issued by or on behalf of the Landlord in the interests of proper use of the Subjects and of internal and external accommodation, systems and services pertaining to the building or complex containing the Subjects. This also covers instructions relating to maintenance, inspection, noise levels, tidiness, fire prevention, parking regime and the proper functioning of the systems and the building or complex containing the Subjects.</p>
          <p id="s1p26">6.3</p>
          <p id="s1p27">The Tenant shall not cause any hindrance or inconvenience by its use of the building or complex containing the Subjects. The Tenant shall also ensure that any third parties present with its permission will not cause any nuisance.</p>
          <p id="s1p28">6.4</p>
          <p id="s1p29">The Tenant is entitled and obliged to use the communal provisions and services made or to be made available in the interests of the proper operation of the building or complex containing the Subjects.</p>
          <p id="s1p30">6.5</p>
          <p id="s1p31">The Landlord shall be entitled to have access to the roofs, external walls, spaces not accessible by the public or by the Tenant, the immoveable appurtenances within and outside the building or complex and also the gardens and ground pertaining to the building or complex, for itself, tenants and third parties, for the purpose of installing or erecting (illuminated) advertising, sign-work, antenna systems and for other purposes. If the landlord wishes to exercise this right, the Landlord shall notify the Tenant accordingly in advance and shall take the Tenant’s interests into consideration when exercising this right.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">6.6</p>
          <p id="s1p33">The Landlord may refuse the Tenant access to the Subjects if the Tenant has not (yet) complied with its obligations under the Lease when it wishes to start using the Subjects. This shall not affect the date of entry under the Lease, nor the Tenant’s obligations under the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">2</p>
          <p id="s1p35">(Government) conditions and permissions</p>
          <p id="s1p36">6.7.1</p>
          <p id="s1p37">The Tenant shall itself be liable for obtaining any necessary dispensations and/or permissions, including permission for use in relation to the conduct of its business for which the Subjects are or shall be used. The costs arising from this shall be met by the Tenant. The refusal or revocation of such consents shall not afford any opportunity for terminating the Lease nor for any other action against the Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p38">6.7.2</p>
          <p id="s1p39">The Tenant shall carry out its own investigations at the start of the Lease as to whether the Subjects are suitable for the Tenant’s intended use thereof. If any alterations or other provisions have to be carried out in, on or to the Subjects either at the start of the Lease or later as a result of government conditions or conditions imposed by other competent authorities in order to allow the Subjects to be used for the Tenant’s intended purposes, then such alterations or provisions shall be carried out by the Tenant at its own expense, once prior approval has been given by the Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p40">6.7.3</p>
          <p id="s1p41">If any alterations or other provisions are required in, on or to the Subjects in connection with the business operations being carried out there or in order to allow the Subjects to be used for the Tenant’s intended purposes, the Tenant shall be responsible, without prejudice to the terms of Clauses 6.8.1 to 6.8.3 inclusive and 6.11.1 to 6.11.7 inclusive, for ensuring that such work will be carried out in accordance with the requirements imposed or to be imposed by the government or other competent authorities. The Tenant is responsible for continual compliance with the requirements of any consent obtained or to be obtained. The Landlord therefore does not grant any indemnity to the Tenant in respect of (government) orders, further investigation or the taking of further steps.</p>
          <p id="s1p42">Environment</p>
          <p id="s1p43">6.8.1</p>
          <p id="s1p44">If an environmental investigation is undertaken at the start of the Lease in relation to the Subjects, and a subsequent similar investigation either during or after the end of the Lease discloses higher concentrations of one or more substances in, on or about the Subjects than those present at the time of the earlier inspection, then the Tenant shall be liable to pay any damages arising from the pollution and shall be liable to the Landlord for costs incurred in removing the pollution or the taking of other steps. The Tenant shall indemnify the Landlord against claims in this context by third parties, including government institutions.</p>
          <p id="s1p45">6.8.2</p>
          <p id="s1p46">The provisions in Clause 6.8.1 shall not apply if the Tenant proves that the pollution has not occurred because of actions or omissions on its own part or by its staff or other individuals or articles under its supervision and are not related to circumstances for which the Tenant can be blamed.</p>
          <p id="s1p47">6.8.3</p>
          <p id="s1p48">The Landlord does not grant any indemnity to the Tenant in respect of (government) orders, further investigation or the taking of further steps.</p>
          <p id="s1p49">Waste material/chemical waste</p>
          <p id="s1p50">6.8</p>
          <p id="s1p51">The Tenant shall comply fully with any guidelines, conditions or instructions issued by government or other competent authorities in relation to the (separate) collection of waste materials. In the event of failure to comply (fully) with this obligation, the Tenant shall be liable for any resulting financial, criminal and other consequences.</p>
          <p id="s1p52">3</p>
          <p id="s1p53">Apartment rights</p>
          <p id="s1p54">6.10.1</p>
          <p id="s1p55">If the building or complex containing the Subjects is or comes to be divided into apartment rights, the Tenant shall observe the conditions relating to usage imposed by the deed of division and regulations. The same shall apply if the building or complex is or becomes part of a co-operative.</p>
          <p id="s1p56">6.10.2</p>
          <p id="s1p57">The Landlord shall not, so far as possible, lend its co-operation to the imposition of any conditions which would be in conflict with the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p58">6.10.3</p>
          <p id="s1p59">The Landlord shall ensure that the Tenant receives a copy of the conditions relating to usage, as specified in Clause 6.10.1.</p>
          <p id="s1p60">Prohibitions and procedural conditions</p>
          <p id="s1p61">6.11.1</p>
          <p id="s1p62">The Tenant is not permitted to:</p>
          <p id="s1p63">a.</p>
          <p id="s1p64">have any environmentally hazardous materials in, on or in the immediate vicinity of the Subjects, including noxious, flammable or explosive materials, unless these are held in the normal course of business;</p>
          <p id="s1p65">b.</p>
          <p id="s1p66">load the floors of the Subjects or the building or complex containing the Subjects in excess of the technically permitted limit or the limit prescribed in the Lease;</p>
          <p id="s1p67">c.</p>
          <p id="s1p68">use the Subjects in such a way as results in the occurrence of soil or other pollution, damage to the Subjects or spoiling of the appearance of the Subjects, including the use of transportation equipment which might damage walls or floors;</p>
          <p id="s1p69">d.</p>
          <p id="s1p70">introduce alterations or facilities in, on or about the Subjects in contravention of government or authority conditions or the conditions under which the owner of the Subjects acquired that ownership or other restricted rights, or such as might be a nuisance to other tenants or neighbours or hinder their usage rights.</p>
          <p id="s1p71">6.11.2.1 The Tenant shall at all times keep the Landlord informed in writing about any alterations or additions which the Tenant wishes to carry out or obtain in, on or about the Subjects, such as nameplates, advertisements, boards, recommendations, publications, structures, joinery-work, packaging, goods, vending machines, lighting, sun awnings, roller shutters, aerials and associated equipment, flagpoles, blanking out of windows etcetera.</p>

          <p id="s1p73">6.11.2.3 The Tenant shall require the Landlord’s prior written consent for the complete or partial alteration of the furnishings or fittings within the Subjects, unless the alterations or additions are of a sort that can be dismantled and removed at nominal cost at the end of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p74">6.11.2.4 Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, the Landlord does not grant any consent for alterations and additions which the Tenant wishes to introduce if they cannot be removed at the end of the Lease without damaging the Subjects and at nominal cost, or if these alterations and additions are not necessary for the proposed use of the Subjects, or if the enjoyment of the tenancy would not be improved, or if the Landlord has any strong objections to the proposals.</p>
          <p id="s1p75">6.11.2.5 The Landlord shall be entitled to impose conditions in relation to any alterations or additions desired by the Tenant, such as in relation to the carrying out and positioning of the work, the proportions and the materials to be used. The Tenant shall be obliged to comply with any conditions imposed by the relevant competent authorities in relation to its alterations or additions.</p>

          <p id="s1p79">6.11.2.8 The Tenant waives its rights and claims for unjustified enrichment in connection with alterations and additions introduced by or on behalf of the Tenant and which are not dismantled at the end of the Lease, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.</p>

          <p id="s1p82">The Tenant shall behave in accordance with the conditions imposed by government and other authorised bodies, and also verbal and written instructions from the Landlord, in relation to the times for loading and unloading and the manner in which this should be done.</p>

          <p id="s1p89">6.11.7</p>
          <p id="s1p90">If articles introduced by the Tenant (including advertising or other sign-work) have to be removed temporarily in connection with maintenance or repair work to the Subjects or the building or complex containing the Subjects, the costs of such removal, any storage costs and the reinstatement costs shall all be the Tenant’s financial and risk responsibility, whether or not the Landlord gave permission for the said articles to be introduced in the first place.</p>
          <p id="s1p91">Requests/permissions</p>

          <p id="s1p99">Penalty provisions</p>
          <p id="s1p100">7.</p>
          <p id="s1p101">If, having duly received a notice of default from the Landlord, the Tenant continues to breach the conditions in the Lease and in these General Conditions, then the Tenant shall, if no other penalty is specified, be liable to pay to the Landlord an immediately recoverable fine of € 250.- per day for every day during which the Tenant continues in default. The foregoing is without prejudice to the Landlord’s right to full compensation insofar as the losses suffered exceed the penalty imposed.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">Sub-let</p>
          <p id="s1p103">8.1</p>

          <p id="s1p105">8.2</p>
          <p id="s1p106">If the Tenant contravenes the foregoing provisions, it will be liable to the Landlord for a directly enforceable penalty for each day that the contravention continues, equivalent to two times the daily rental payable by the Tenant at the time, without prejudice to the Landlord’s right to have the Lease complied with or to dissolve the Lease on the grounds of breach of contract, and to claim damages.</p>
          <p id="s1p107">Review of rental</p>
          <p id="s1p108">9.1</p>
          <p id="s1p109">The rental review agreed in Clause 4.5 of the Lease shall take place on the basis of the alteration of the monthly price index of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), all households series (2000 = 100), published by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The amended rental shall be calculated according to the following formula: the amended rental shall be equivalent to the existing rental of the date of amendment, multiplied by the index point in the fourth calendar month before the calendar month in which the rental is reviewed, divided by the index point of the sixteenth calendar month before the calendar month in which the rental is reviewed.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">9.2</p>
          <p id="s1p111">The rental shall not be adjusted if the adjustment would lead to a lower rental than the most recently valid figure. In such a case the most recently valid rental figure will continue to apply until a subsequent indexation of the index point in the calendar month four months prior to the adjustment is higher than the index point of the calendar month four months prior to the calendar month in which the most recent adjustment took place. In such a case the rental adjustment will use the index points of the calendar months indicated in the foregoing sub-paragraph (9.1).</p>
          <p id="s1p112">9.3</p>
          <p id="s1p113">It is necessary for the validity of a newly indexed rental that the Tenant is advised separately in advance of the indexation proposed or just carried out.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">9.4</p>
          <p id="s1p115">An indexation method as closely comparable as possible shall be used if the CBS ceases publication of its index points or alters their basis of calculation, and in case of a difference of opinion on this matter, the party taking the initiative may ask the Director of the CBS to pronounce a decision to be binding on the parties. Half of any costs associated with this will be borne by each of the parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p116">6</p>
          <p id="s1p117">End of the Lease or of Use</p>
          <p id="s1p118">10.1.1</p>
          <p id="s1p119">Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Tenant shall surrender the Subjects to the Landlord at the end of the Lease or at the end of use thereof in the condition as described in the report on transfer at the start of the Lease, account being taken of any normal wear and tear and ageing.</p>
          <p id="s1p120">10.1.2</p>
          <p id="s1p121">If no report on transfer has been prepared in relation to the Subjects at the start of the Lease, then the Subjects shall be handed back by the Tenant to the Landlord at the end of the Lease or the end of the Tenant’s use in the condition which might reasonably be expected from a well-maintained property of the type to which the Lease relates, without defects, unless otherwise agreed in writing, and subject to normal wear and tear and ageing.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">10.1.3</p>
          <p id="s1p123">In any debate over the condition of the Subjects at the start of the Lease, the Tenant will be assumed to have received the Subjects in good condition and without defects.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">10.1.4</p>
          <p id="s1p125">Furthermore, the Subjects will be handed back to the Landlord completely vacated, free of use and rights of use, properly cleaned and with all keys, key cards and suchlike pertaining thereto. The Tenant shall be obliged to remove all items it has introduced in, on or about the Subjects or which were taken over by it from the foregoing tenant or occupier, all at the Tenant’s expense. The Landlord shall not be liable to make any payment for items not removed. Items not already removed may be removed at the Tenant’s expense. The provisions of Clauses 6.11.2.6 and 6.11.2.7 shall apply.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">10.2</p>
          <p id="s1p127">If the Tenant ends its use of the Subjects prematurely, the Landlord shall be entitled to obtain access to and take over possession of the Subjects at the Tenant’s expense, with no rights to compensation accruing to the Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">10.3</p>
          <p id="s1p129">All items deemed to have been abandoned by the Tenant through leaving them in the Subjects when it actually leaves the Subjects may, in the Landlord’s option, be removed by the Landlord, at the Tenant’s expense, without any liability on the Landlord’s part. The Landlord shall be entitled - unless the Landlord is aware that the ensuing tenant has taken the items over - to take these items away for immediate destruction at the Tenant’s expense or to appropriate them to its own possession and thereafter, if so desired, to sell them and retain the proceeds of sale, all in the Landlord’s own discretion. If the ensuing tenant has taken over the items, the Tenant shall be obliged to prepare a description, along with the ensuing tenant, of all items being taken over by the ensuing tenant. This description, initialled by the Tenant and the ensuing tenant, should be sent to the Landlord immediately after it is prepared.</p>
          <p id="s1p130">10.4</p>
          <p id="s1p131">Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Landlord and the Tenant, the Tenant shall in no circumstances be entitled to leave behind any items in the Subjects after the end of the Lease while awaiting a response to the question as to whether an ensuing tenant is likely to want to take over these items. If the Tenant fails to comply with this provision, the Landlord shall be entitled, at its own discretion, to have the items in question destroyed immediately, at the Tenant’s expense, or else to appropriate these items to its own use and, if so desired, to sell them and retain the proceeds of sale.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">10.5</p>
          <p id="s1p133">The Subjects must be inspected by the parties jointly, in good time before the end of the Lease or the end of use. A report of this inspection shall be prepared by the parties and shall record the findings in relation to the condition of the Subjects. This report shall also record which work still has to be done at the Tenant’s expense in relation to repairs apparently required in terms of the report and any maintenance required in hindsight, as well as the manner in which that work will have to be accomplished. The inspection and the preparation and signing of the inspection report shall be effected either by the parties or by their appointed representatives.

          <p id="s1p288">If it has been agreed that Turnover Tax will be charged on the rental, the Tenant and the Landlord hereby explicitly declare that an assumption was made when setting the rental that the Tenant would use or cause the use of the Subjects continuously for at least the minimum percentage of time set or to be set in order to qualify for entitlement to deduction of Turnover Tax, insofar as that can be elected for a lease subject to Turnover Tax.</p>

Such loss shall refer to the full amount of the Turnover Tax due by the Landlord or its legal successor(s) to the tax authorities, together with interest, any surcharges and further costs and damages. The terms of this paragraph make provision for a compensation scheme in the event that the option is terminated with retrospective effect, in addition to the regulations under Clause 19.3a. The extra losses suffered by the Landlord or its legal successor(s) as a result of retrospective impact shall be payable by the Tenant immediately, in full and in one lump sum.
