          <p id="s1p51">THIS LEASE, made this 27 day of Feb, 1998, by and between Glacier Partners, an Idaho general partnership, hereinafter referred to as &quot;Lessor&quot;, and Advanced Input Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation, hereinafter referred to as &quot;Lessee.&quot;</p>
          <p id="s1p52">Background</p>
          <p id="s1p53">Lessor and Lessee are desirous of entering into a lease agreement for a new building located on approximately 13 acres of real estate situated near the SW corner of U.S. 95 and Wilbur Ave. (assessors parcel #C-0000-026-8200) Kootenai County, Idaho. The proposed construction contemplates a complete &quot;turn key&quot; facility that includes the site improvements, building, and street revisions as set forth in the specifications attached hereto. It is anticipated that quality of the improvements will be similar to that used in new Class A buildings in the Coeur d'Alene marketplace, such as the Cd'A Tech Center Buildings on U.S. 95.</p>
          <p id="s1p54">It is also anticipated that improvements by Lessee will include the furnishing of all office furniture and partitions, all telephone and data wiring and equipment and all interior identification signage (except as required by codes).</p>
          <p id="s1p55">The initial building area will be approximately 85,000 square feet divided into 20,000 square feet of office space and 65,000 square feet of manufacturing/production/processing/assembly space.</p>
          <p id="s1p56">WITNESSETH:</p>
          <p id="s1p57">1. Demised Premises:</p>
          <p id="s1p58">1.1 Demised Premises. The Demised Premises hereby leased by Lessor to Lessee are approximately 13 acres of real property, including a building and improvements (collectively, &quot;Building&quot;) to be built by Lessor of initially 85,000 square feet, and possible expansion space of approximately 40,000 square feet, all as set forth on Exhibit &quot;B&quot;. The legal description for the Demised Premises is attached as Exhibit &quot;A&quot; and incorporated by this reference. The general specifications for the Building to be constructed and leased are attached as Exhibit &quot;B&quot; and incorporated by this reference and are generally depicted on the Site Plan (&quot;Site Plan&quot;) attached as Exhibit &quot;C.&quot;</p>
          <p id="s1p59">1.2 Work of Improvement. The Building and Demised Premises shall be improved and delivered by Lessor to Lessee according to the building standards and specifications of Exhibit &quot;B&quot; and the Site Plan (&quot;Lessor's Work&quot;). Lessee shall have the right to review and approve the design and specifications for Lessor's Work at all stages of development, including (a) the initial design and schematic plans and (b) final plans and specifications and construction drawings (&quot;Construction Documents&quot;). As used herein, Lessor's Work shall include the access road work described in Paragraph 1.6.</p>
          <p id="s1p60">Lessor and Lessee shall each proceed with all necessary due diligence and in good faith, exerting their best efforts to complete such matters as require action or approval on the part of Lessor and Lessee in accordance with the development schedule contained in this Lease and during the course of construction anticipated under this Lease; and Lessor and Lessee agree to promptly and diligently respond to all questions and concerns raised by the architect, engineers and other consultants. Throughout the period of design, development and construction of the Building, Lessor shall hold weekly meetings with the project development team consisting of Lessee and/or Lessee's authorized representative, the architect, the general contractor, and engineers and other consultants as necessary, to discuss the scheduling and progress of the Building; and, after Substantial Completion (as defined in Paragraph 2.1) of the Building, shall hold such meetings with Lessee and/or Lessee's authorized representative as are mutually determined to be necessary with respect to completion of the punchlist items determined under the punchlist inspection process described in Paragraph 2.1, and the matters and conditions for issuance by the City of Coeur d'Alene of the final certificate of occupancy.</p>
          <p id="s1p61">1</p>
          <p id="s1p62">Lessor agrees that in the selection of the general contractor and the negotiation of the general contract, the fee to be paid to the general contractor and the general conditions will be competitive with the market. Lessee shall have the right to review and approve the selection of the general contractor and the form of construction contract to be entered into between Lessor and the general contractor, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Lessor also agrees that all subcontracts will be competitively bid, unless otherwise agreed between Lessor and Lessee. All subcontracts shall be subject to the review and approval of Lessee, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.</p>
          <p id="s1p63">1.3 Parking. Lessor shall provide Lessee approximately 475 parking stalls as described and shown on Exhibit &quot;C&quot;.</p>
          <p id="s1p64">1.4 Public Areas. Lessor also grants to Lessee the rights of 24-hour a day ingress and egress to and from the Demised Premises to adjoining public streets.</p>
          <p id="s1p65">1.5 Expansion of Demised Premises. Upon election by the Lessee, the Lessor shall build an additional 40,000 square feet of building improvements as shown as &quot;expansion space&quot; on Exhibit C, together with an additional 225 parking spaces in the location shown on Exhibit C (collectively, &quot;Expansion&quot;). Lessee may elect to require Lessor to build the Expansion by written notice (&quot;Expansion Notice&quot;) to Lessor, which notice shall also set forth Lessee's desired occupancy date for the Expansion. Promptly after delivery of an Expansion Notice, Lessor and Lessee shall work together to agree upon plans and specifications for the Expansion. Lessor, at its sole and expense, will construct and improve the Expansion with tenant improvements consistent with and equivalent in quality and character to the tenant improvements then-existing in the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p66">All of the terms and conditions of this Lease (including, but not limited to, Paragraph 2.7) shall be applicable to the design, construction and leasing of the Expansion; provided, however, that if Lessor does not Substantially Complete the Expansion on or before the date which is five (5) months after the design and permitting for the Expansion has been completed (but if such five (5) month period would require construction to occur during the months of October through March, the five (5) month period shall be extended to seven (7) months), then the amount of the liquidated damages which shall be paid under Paragraph 2.4 shall be $500.00 per day; and provided, further, that the Lease term shall not be extended by reason of construction of the Expansion.</p>
          <p id="s1p67">1.6 Access Road. The site access road shown on Wilbur St. across from Mineral Drive shall be built as a part of this project. If the Lessors and Lessees mutually agree to use to use this access point to serve the adjacent 7 acres at some time in the future, the Lessors shall reimburse the Lessee one half of the construction cost in cash, and the leased premises shall be revised to show the property line in the center of the access roadway with a cross-use easement running to the benefit of both parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p68">2. Term:</p>
          <p id="s1p69">2.1 Term. The initial Lease term (&quot;Initial Term&quot;) shall be eighteen (18) years, commencing upon Substantial Completion (as hereinafter defined) of all improvements called for in Paragraph 1.2 (hereinafter the &quot;Commencement Date&quot;) and ending eighteen (18) years thereafter. As used herein, &quot;Substantial Completion&quot; shall mean the date when (a) the Building is accessible and fully usable by Lessee for its normal business operations and the access road work described in Paragraph 1.6 is completed and open for use, (b) a certificate of occupancy permitting the use of the Building for Lessee's intended use has been issued by the City of Coeur d'Alene, and (c) the project architect has executed a certificate certifying that Lessor's Work has been substantially completed in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by Lessor and Lessee. At the time of Substantial Completion, Lessor and Lessee shall conduct a joint inspection of the work in order to develop a punch list of additional work to be completed by Lessor. Lessor shall promptly and diligently complete all items on the punch list, and if such work is not completed within thirty (30) days of the date of Substantial Completion, Lessee may, but shall not be required to, complete such punch list work and offset the</p>
          <p id="s1p70">2</p>
          <p id="s1p71">cost to complete against its monetary obligations under this Lease. Rent for any fractional calendar month shall be the prorated portion of the annual rent computed on a daily basis. The Commencement Date, when determined, and the annual rental rate, when determined pursuant to Paragraph 3.1 below, shall be confirmed in writing by the parties promptly upon such commencement and thereupon shall be inserted, together with the expiration date, in the form of commencement letter attached hereto as Exhibit E.</p>
          <p id="s1p72">2.2 Early Occupancy. Lessee may, barring any reasonable objections from Lessor, have access to the Demised Premises prior to the Commencement Date for purposes of installing equipment, furniture, partitions and wiring. Such access shall be coordinated with Lessor's general contractor (&quot;General Contractor&quot;) and shall fall under the same work rules, safety precautions and overall supervision of the General Contractor but the General Contractor shall have no responsibility for the Lessee's equipment installation.</p>
          <p id="s1p73">2.3 Options to Extend Term. If Lessee is not in default under the terms and conditions of this Lease beyond applicable notice and grace periods at the end of the Initial Term or any term to be extended, Lessee shall have options to extend the term of this Lease for two (2) consecutive five (5) year terms upon the same terms and conditions as herein specified except at an adjusted rental amount as described in Paragraph 3.3 below.</p>
          <p id="s1p74">Lessee must irrevocably exercise each option by providing written notice to Lessor not later than twelve (12) months prior to expiration of the Lease term to be extended.</p>
          <p id="s1p75">2.4 Lessor's Delay in Delivery of Demised Premises. In the event Lessor is unable to deliver the Demised Premises Substantially Completed to Lessee on or before March 31, 1999 because of failure of Lessor, Lessor's employees, agents or subcontractors to complete construction other than for reasons beyond the reasonable control of Lessor, including extreme and abnormal weather conditions (but excluding financial or economic reasons), Lessor shall reimburse Lessee for any and all increased moving costs, any and all rent differential and all other actual damages incurred by Lessee as a result of the failure to deliver the Demised Premises on the due date. The parties acknowledge that such damages are difficult to estimate or determine; therefore Lessor, in lieu of requiring Lessee to assess such costs, hereby agrees to pay Lessee as liquidated damages and not as a penalty in the amount of $2,000 per day for each day of non-delivery of any or all of the Demised Premises beyond March 31, 1999.</p>
          <p id="s1p76">2.5 Force Majeure. Lessor's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease shall be excused if due to causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of Lessor, including acts of God, acts of the public enemy, fires, floods, epidemics and strikes, but Lessor's failure to perform shall not be excused if due to financial or economic reasons.</p>
          <p id="s1p77">2.6 Lessee's Delay. It is the intent of the parties that the Commencement of Construction (as defined in Paragraph 31) shall occur on or before July 1, 1998. The Lessee has hired Eixenberger Architect to design and complete the Construction Documents. Lessor shall deliver construction documents to Lessee by May 15, 1998. Lessee shall approve the Construction Documents for the project by May 22, 1998. Any delay in the Lessee approvals that is the sole cause of an extension of the commencement of construction date shall also adjust any compensatory adjustment referenced in Paragraph 2.4. Lessee agrees that Lessor shall not be liable for any liquidated damages, or costs to Lessee associated with or resulting from unreasonable delays in Lessee's information and/or approvals, but Lessor shall first give Lessee reasonable written notice of such alleged delays and a reasonable opportunity to provide such information and/or approvals. Should Lessee be responsible for a delay in milestone approvals (as indicated on Exhibit &quot;F&quot;) such that Commencement of Construction occurs after July 1, 1998, any additional winter construction cost premium shall be Lessee's responsibility.</p>
          <p id="s1p78">3</p>
          <p id="s1p79">2.7 Termination of Lease. If for any reason whatsoever the Demised Premises have not been Substantially Completed and delivered within 13 months after approval of the Construction Documents by the Lessee, Lessee may, but shall not be obligated to, terminate this Lease and have no further obligations to Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p80">3. Rental; Development Budget:</p>
          <p id="s1p81">3.1 Rental: Development Budget. Subject to all terms and conditions of this Lease, Lessee shall pay Lessor monthly, in advance, beginning on the Commencement Date, and continuing thereafter on or before each monthly anniversary of the Commencement Date of the term hereof, the Base Monthly Rental as determined by the formula below. The Base Monthly Rental is based upon the construction of the Demised Premises as set forth in the Exhibits hereto and as subsequently modified in writing by the parties. The &quot;Base Monthly Rental&quot; will be one twelfth (1/12) of the amount determined by the product of the &quot;Annual Rent Multiplier&quot; (as defined below) times the revised development budget as described below.</p>
          <p id="s1p82">The current project development budget (&quot;Development Budget&quot;) is shown in Exhibit D. The budget categories of Land, Building architectural and engineering, Construction Site and Financing are under the control of the Lessor. Lessor shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for any costs incurred under such budget categories in excess of the amounts shown on Exhibit D. Cost allowances for the budget categories of Miscellaneous, Project Administration and the Contingency are shown on Exhibit D and may only be revised with the written concurrence of Lessor and the Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">Prior to the Commencement of Construction, the parties shall agree on the final Development Budget (&quot;Final Development Budget&quot;). After the Final Development Budget has been determined and agreed upon, the risk of any increased costs thereunder shall be borne by the Lessor and the Total Development Costs shall not exceed the amount shown on the Final Development Budget (except with respect to any design change orders initiated by Lessee which increase the cost of the project as described in Paragraph 32). Any cost savings which result in the final actual development costs being less than the Total Development Costs in the Final Development Budget shall accrue to the benefit of Lessee. Lessee shall have the right to receive the benefit of such cost savings as a reduction in rental payments, and the parties shall within thirty (30) days make an appropriate reconciliation and reimbursement if Lessee shall have previously paid Base Monthly Rental in a higher amount. Once the entire construction contract is fully executed and a notice to proceed has been issued, the actual cost of construction will change only with change orders agreed to in writing by both parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p84">The annual rent will be determined by multiplying the Total Development Cost in the Final Development Budget times the Annual Rent Multiplier; provided, however, that should Lessee on its own initiative make design change orders as described in Paragraph 32 which increase the cost of the project such that the Final Development Budget is increased after the Commencement of Construction, then the annual rent will be adjusted in accordance with this formula.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">As used herein, &quot;Annual Rent Multiplier&quot; shall mean 0.09825.</p>
          <p id="s1p86">From and after March 1, 1998, Lessor shall deliver to Lessee, no less than once every month, a Development Cost Report with respect to the Development Budget, which shall contain the line items shown in the Development Budget and shall otherwise be in substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-1 and containing the information requested by Lessee (e.g., specifying &quot;approved revision&quot;, &quot;amounts requested&quot;, &quot;balance to complete&quot;, &quot;current revised budget&quot;, and &quot;variances to budget&quot;). Throughout the design and construction process Lessor shall make available to Lessee for inspection all books and records, as well as contracts, bills, vouchers, and checks, and such other documents as are necessary to properly audit all development costs.</p>
          <p id="s1p87">3.2 Rental Increases. During the initial three years of this Lease, there shall be no increase in the rent. Commencing with year four (4) of the Lease and thereafter each year until the end of the</p>
          <p id="s1p88">4</p>
          <p id="s1p89">eighteen year Initial Term, the rental will be subject to increase 1.35% annually, as shown on the rental schedule attached hereto as Exhibit D-2.</p>
          <p id="s1p90">3.3 Rent during extension option periods. The rental rate during each extension term shall be 94% of the fair market rental value as of the commencement of the applicable extension term, determined as provided in this Paragraph 3.3. Lessor and Lessee shall seek to agree as to the fair market rental value within thirty (30) days after Lessee gives Lessor notice of its election to renew this Lease. If Lessor and Lessee do not agree as to the fair market rental value within such thirty (30) day period, the following provisions shall apply:</p>
          <p id="s1p91">(a) Within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the above-mentioned thirty (30) day period, Lessor and Lessee shall each identify an impartial person to act as a valuation expert and notify the other thereof. The expert specified in each such notice must be a commercial real estate M.A.I. appraiser conducting business in Kootenai County area. If either party fails to appoint an expert within such fifteen (15) day period, then the determination of the expert first appointed shall be final, conclusive and binding on both parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p92">(b) The named experts shall together determine the fair market rental value for the extended term. In making such determination, the experts shall consider the rentals at which leases are being concluded for comparable space in Kootenai County. If the experts fail to agree on the fair market rental value within thirty (30) days of their appointment and the difference in their conclusions about fair market rental value is ten percent (10%) or less of the lower of the two determinations, fair market rental value shall be the average of the two determinations.</p>
          <p id="s1p93">(c) If the two experts fail to agree on fair market rental value and the difference between the two determinations exceeds ten percent (10%) of the lower of the two determinations, then the experts shall appoint a third M.A.I. appraiser, similarly impartial and qualified, to determine the fair market rental value. Such third expert shall determine the fair market rental value within thirty (30) days of his or her appointment, and the average of the determinations of the two closest experts is final, conclusive and binding on Lessor and Lessee. Lessor and Lessee shall each execute and deliver an agreement confirming annual rent for the extension term.</p>
          <p id="s1p94">(d) Lessor and Lessee shall each pay the fees of any expert appointed by Lessor and Lessee, respectively, and Lessor and Lessee shall each pay one-half (1/2) of the fees of the third expert, if any.</p>
          <p id="s1p95">3.4 Rent for Expansion Space. The actual construction costs of the Expansion shall be actively managed by both the Lessor and the Lessee. The actual costs shall be made up of:</p>
          <p id="s1p96">•</p>
          <p id="s1p97">the actual cost of hard construction costs, plus</p>
          <p id="s1p98">•</p>
          <p id="s1p99">the actual cost of the design, engineering, financing and miscellaneous costs.</p>
          <p id="s1p100">The total cost of the Expansion shall be increased by a fee of 6% for the Lessor. The rent shall be calculated without additional margin for the Lessor by utilizing an interest rate of prime plus two percent amortized over the remaining term of the Lease; provided, however, that the foregoing interest rate of prime plus two percent shall be reduced if Lessee, at Lessee's option, provides financing to Lessor for purposes of construction of the Expansion, in which case the interest rate used in the foregoing calculation shall be the interest rate provided by Lessee to Lessor in connection with such financing.</p>
          <p id="s1p101">3.5 Refund of Rent. If this Lease terminates before the expiration date of the Initial Term or any extension term for reasons other than Lessee's default, Base Monthly Rental shall be prorated to the date of termination and Lessor shall immediately repay to Lessee all Base Monthly Rental then prepaid and unearned. Lessee's rights under this Paragraph 3.5 are in addition to, and not a limitation of, any other rights Lessee may have under this Lease, in equity or in law.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">5</p>
          <p id="s1p103">3.6 Deposit. Lessee shall, simultaneously herewith, deposit $15,000 with the Lessor as a security deposit that shall be held by the Lessor as security for full performance of Lessee's obligations for default in payment of rent, repairs, damages or cleaning expenses as the result of Lessee's occupancy. The security deposit shall be held in a separate interest-bearing account, as reasonably directed by Lessee, and the interest shall be shared equally by Lessor and Lessee and shall be disbursed and paid to the parties at least annually. The deposit shall be refunded to Lessee, less any applicable charges, but together with Lessee's one-half share of any accrued and unpaid interest, at the end of the Lease term or the earlier termination of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">4. Holdover:</p>
          <p id="s1p105">If Lessee holds possession of the Demised Premises after the expiration of the Lease term, Lessee shall be deemed to be a month-to-month tenant upon the same terms and conditions as contained herein. Any such tenancy may be terminated as provided by Idaho law. During such tenancy, Lessee agrees to pay Lessor rental at an increased rate of 25% of the then Base Monthly Rental applicable during the last year of the Lease term preceding any such holding over.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">5. Use:</p>
          <p id="s1p107">Lessee agrees to use the Demised Premises for an office and manufacturing/production/processing/assembly building (and Lessor represents and warrants to Lessee that all such uses are allowed as of right under applicable zoning), and shall conduct no other business on or make any other use of the Demised Premises without the written consent of Lessor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Lessee recognizes that Industrial Revenue Bond financing in which the interest is intended to be exempt from federal income taxes (&quot;IRB Financing&quot;) is being used for this project and the use of the Building is limited to manufacturing/production/processing/assembly purposes with no more than 25% office space. If the Lessee (a) increases the amount of office use in the Demised Premises to more than 25% of the total space, or (b) incurs more than $7,000,000 in &quot;Capital Costs&quot; (as hereinafter defined) in Kootenai County, Idaho during the Capital Cost Restriction Period (as hereinafter defined), and if either such occurrence is the sole reason which causes the loss of the tax exemption for the IRB Financing bonds and requires Lessor to refinance with conventional taxable financing or taxable bonds, the rent shall be increased in order to allow Lessor to recover over the remaining Lease term the actual increase in costs of refinancing the project with conventional taxable financing or taxable bonds. As used herein, &quot;Capital Costs&quot; shall mean those costs characterized as &quot;capital&quot; under generally accepted accounting principles. As used herein, &quot;Capital Cost Restriction Period&quot; shall mean the six (6) year period which commenced three (3) years prior to issuance of the bonds constituting the IRB Financing for the Building and which expires three (3) years after issuance of such bonds. Lessee shall not use or permit the Demised Premises to be used for any illegal purpose and shall be responsible to determine that Lessee's operations comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and requirements.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">6. Services, Utilities and Taxes:</p>
          <p id="s1p109">Except as expressly set forth in this Lease, this Lease shall be absolutely net to the Lessor, and all property and other taxes, operating costs, insurance premiums, utilities of every sort, maintenance and each and every other cost (other than debt service) shall be the responsibility of the Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">6.1 Utilities. Throughout the term of the Lease, and throughout any extension or option term, Lessee shall pay all charges for heat, lights, water and sewer and any other public utilities. Lessee shall make any deposits necessary for utility services and Lessee shall promptly pay all utility bills and shall not allow any liens to be placed on the property by utility providers.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">6.2 Taxes. Beginning with the Commencement Date of the Lease term, Lessee shall pay all real property taxes and assessments which at any time during the term of this Lease shall be assessed against the Demised Premises. The tax parcel number will be provided after it is obtained from the County Assessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p112">6</p>
          <p id="s1p113">Lessee reserves the right, at the sole expense of Lessee, to contest in good faith the amount of or legality of any tax or assessment so long as such contest shall not subject Lessor to any criminal or civil penalty or to any potential loss of ownership or use or occupancy of the Building or the Demised Premises. If Lessee elects to so contest any such tax or assessment, and pending the outcome of any such contest, Lessee may defer the payment thereof, provided that Lessee shall, in any event, pay the tax or assessment before delinquency, and Lessee may in such event pay the tax or assessment under protest. If requested by Lessee, Lessor shall, at no cost to Lessor, execute or join in the execution of any instrument or document necessary in connection with any such contest. In the event Lessee elects to so contest any such tax or assessment, Lessee shall give Lessor written notice of Lessee's intention to make such contest, Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from any costs, expenses, penalties or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with such contest, and upon termination of the contest Lessee shall pay all amounts, including without limitation interest and penalties, due by reason of such contest.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">7. Repairs and Maintenance:</p>
          <p id="s1p115">7.1 Lessee's Responsibilities; Lessor's Warranty. Lessee shall be responsible for all interior and exterior maintenance of the Building, specifically including but not limited to repairs to the heating and cooling systems, plumbing systems, electrical system and drainage system.

Except as provided in paragraph 7.2, Lessee shall specifically be responsible for all repairs to and maintenance of the Demised Premises, ground and parking, including but not limited to:</p>
          <p id="s1p116">a. Maintenance of and repairs to the roof on the Demised Premises;</p>
          <p id="s1p117">b. Maintenance of and repairs to, including cost of replacement of all or any portion of, the mechanical and electrical, heating and cooling, security and fire, plumbing and drainage systems and fixtures and all of the Building systems to keep such systems in good order, condition and repair;</p>
          <p id="s1p118">c. Maintenance of and repairs to lavatories;</p>
          <p id="s1p119">d. Replacement lamps, bulbs, starters and ballasts;</p>
          <p id="s1p120">e. Interior painting;</p>
          <p id="s1p121">f. Exterior and common area maintenance and repairs including, but not limited to, exterior painting; exterior cleaning including window washing; gutter cleaning and repair; sidewalks; curb repair; parking lots and parking stripage; signage; snow removal and landscape maintenance and repair;</p>
          <p id="s1p122">g. Repairs, changes or alterations in or on the Demised Premises as required by the codes or regulations of any governmental body exercising jurisdiction over the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">In consideration of Lessee assuming the repairs and maintenance set forth herein, Lessor covenants and agrees to pass through the benefit of all warranties of whatever nature that accrue to the benefit of the Owner as Lessor. Lessor agrees to purchase the manufacturer's ten (10) year warranty in connection with the roof of the Demised Premises. The electrical and HVAC equipment is warranted by the Lessor for a period of two years from the Commencement Date. The HVAC warrantee is for premature equipment failure. All normal maintenance shall be the responsibility of the Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">7</p>
          <p id="s1p125">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Lessor shall promptly correct all defects in Lessor's Work and failures of Lessor's Work to conform to the plans and specifications for such work which had had been agreed upon by Lessor and Lessee, which defects or nonconformities are discovered before or within one (1) year after the date upon which Lessee first occupies the Demised Premises. Lessor shall bear all costs of correcting Lessor's Work. Lessor and Lessee shall each give the other prompt written notice after discovering the existence of any such defects or nonconformities in Lessor's Work.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">7.2 Lessor's Responsibilities. Lessor, at its own cost and expense, is responsible for all repairs and maintenance of the structural portions of the Demised Premises, the foundation, exterior walls, bearing walls, and roof structure.</p>
          <p id="s1p127">8. Lessee's Default and Lessor Remedies:</p>
          <p id="s1p128">8.1 Lessee's Default. The following events shall be deemed to be events of default by Lessee under the Lease:</p>
          <p id="s1p129">a. Lessee shall fail to pay any installment of the rent herein reserved when due, or any payment with respect to taxes hereunder when due, or any other payment or reimbursement to Lessor required herein when due, and such failure shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after written notice from Lessor that such payment was overdue.</p>
          <p id="s1p130">b. Lessee shall become insolvent, or shall make a transfer in fraud of creditors, or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">c. Lessee shall file a petition under any section or chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, as amended, or under any similar law or statute of the United States or any State thereof; or Lessee shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent in proceedings filed against Lessee thereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">d. A receiver or trustee shall be appointed for all or substantially all of the assets of Lessee and not discharged in thirty (30) days.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">e. Lessee shall fail to comply with any term, provision or covenant of this Lease (other than the foregoing in this Paragraph 8.1), and shall not cure such failure within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Lessee. Said written notice of default shall specify the matter in default; provided, however, that if the nature of Lessee's obligations are such that more than thirty (30) days are required for performance, then Lessee shall not be in default if Lessee commences performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">8.2 Lessor's Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any of such events of default described in Paragraph 8.1 hereof, Lessor shall have the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies without any notice or demand whatsoever except as required by law:</p>
          <p id="s1p135">a. Terminate this Lease, in which event Lessee shall immediately surrender the Demised Premises to Lessor, and if Lessee fails so to do, Lessor may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Demised Premises and expel or remove Lessee and any other person who may be occupying such Demised Premises or any part thereof. Lessee agrees to pay Lessor on demand the amount of all loss and damage which Lessor may suffer by reason of such termination, whether through inability to relet the Demised Premises on satisfactory terms or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p136">b. Enter upon and take possession of the Demised Premises and expel or remove Lessee and any other person who may be occupying such Demised Premises or any part thereof, and relet the Demised Premises for such terms ending before, on or after the expiration date of the Lease Term at such rental and upon such other conditions as are reasonable, and receive the rent therefor, and</p>
          <p id="s1p137">8</p>
          <p id="s1p138">Lessee agrees to pay to the Lessor on demand any deficiency that may arise by reason of such reletting. In the event Lessor is successful in reletting the Demised Premises at a rental in excess of that agreed to be paid by Lessee pursuant to the terms of this Lease, Lessor and Lessee each mutually agree that Lessee shall not be entitled under any circumstances to such excess rental, and Lessee does hereby specifically waive any claim to such excess rental.</p>
          <p id="s1p139">c. Enter upon the Demised Premises, and do whatever Lessee is obligated to do under the terms of this Lease, and Lessee agrees to reimburse Lessor on demand for any expenses which Lessor may incur in thus effecting compliance with Lessee's obligations under this Lease, together with interest thereon at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.</p>
          <p id="s1p140">d. Whether or not Lessor retakes possession or relets the Demised Premises, Lessor shall have the right to recover unpaid rent and all damages caused by Lessee's default, including attorney's fees. Damage shall include, without limitation: all rentals lost, all legal expenses and other related costs incurred by Lessor following Lessee's default, all costs incurred by Lessor in restoring the Demised Premises to good order and condition, or in remodeling, renovating or otherwise preparing the Demised Premises for reletting, and all brokerage commissions incurred by Lessor in reletting the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p141">e. In the event Lessee fails to pay any installment of rent, additional rent or other charges hereunder within ten (10) days after such installment is due, to help defray the additional cost to Lessor for processing such late payments, Lessee shall pay to Lessor on demand a late charge of five (5%) percent of the Base Monthly Rental. The provision for such late charge shall be in addition to all of Lessor's other rights and remedies hereunder or at law and shall not be construed as liquidated damages or as limiting Lessor's remedies in any manner. However, the first time annually that the rental is paid late, the late charge shall be limited to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).</p>
          <p id="s1p142">f. Pursuit of any of the foregoing remedies shall not preclude pursuit of any of the other remedies herein provided or any other remedies provided by law, such remedies being cumulative and non-exclusive, nor shall pursuit of any remedy herein provided constitute a forfeiture or waiver of any rent due to Lessor hereunder or of any damages accruing to Lessor by reason of the violation of any other terms, provisions and covenants herein contained. No act or thing done by the Lessor during the Lease term hereby granted shall be deemed a termination of this Lease or an acceptance of the surrender of the Demised Premises and no agreement to terminate this Lease or accept surrender of said Demised Premises shall be valid unless in writing signed by the parties hereto. No waiver by Lessor of any violation or breach of any of the terms, provisions and covenants herein contained shall be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of any other violation or breach of any of the terms, provisions and covenants herein contained. Forbearance by Lessor to enforce one or more of the remedies herein provided upon an event of default shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such default or of Lessor's right to enforce any such remedies with respect to such default or any subsequent default. If, on account of any breach or default by Lessee in Lessee's obligations under the terms and conditions of this Lease, it shall become necessary for Lessor to employ an attorney to send a notice of default and pursue other default remedies, Lessee agrees to pay any reasonable attorneys fees so incurred.</p>
          <p id="s1p143">9. Lessor's Default and Lessee's Remedies:</p>
          <p id="s1p144">9.1 Lessor's Default. Lessor shall not be in default unless Lessor fails to perform obligations required of Lessor (including those set forth in the Exhibits) within a reasonable time, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after written notice by Lessee to Lessor, specifying wherein Lessor has failed to perform such obligations; provided, however, that if the nature of Lessor's obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for performance, then Lessor shall not be in default if Lessor</p>
          <p id="s1p145">9</p>
          <p id="s1p146">commences performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">9.2 Lessee's Remedies:</p>
          <p id="s1p148">a. Should Lessor default in the performance of any covenants and/or conditions on the Lessor's part herein contained, and if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice by the Lessee to Lessor hereof, except in case of an emergency in which no notice shall be necessary, or if such default cannot be cured within thirty (30) days, then, if the Lessor does not commence within such thirty (30) days to cure said default and cure the same with all reasonable dispatch, Lessor shall, upon demand, reimburse Lessee for Lessee's costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, together with interest thereon at the rate of twelve (12%) percent per annum. Lessee may, but shall not be required to, offset such costs, expenses and interest against its monetary obligations under this Lease. Nothing contained in this Paragraph shall be construed so as to abridge any rights otherwise available to Lessee at law or in equity.</p>
          <p id="s1p149">b. After the Building and improvements to be constructed by Lessor are Substantially Completed, Lessor and Lessee will inspect the Demised Premises together and prepare a 'punch list' of items to be completed before the Commencement Date. The Lessor shall have thirty (30) days to complete the punch list items. In the event Lessor does not complete the punch-list within thirty (30) days to the reasonable satisfaction of Lessee, then Lessee shall be permitted to complete the punch-list at its cost and expense and deduct or offset said cost and expense from the Base Monthly Rental reserved herein. If a punchlist item reasonably requires more than thirty (30) days to complete then Lessor shall commence correction within thirty (30) days and diligently pursue its timely completion. If the improvements to be constructed by the Lessor do not substantially meet the plans and specifications set forth in the attachments hereto and the Construction Documents, or as subsequently developed or amended by Change Order, and Lessor does not cure any such defect within sixty (60) days after notice from Lessee, Lessee may, but shall not be required to, cure such defect and offset the cost against its monetary obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p150">10. Right to Access:</p>
          <p id="s1p151">10.1 Lessor's. Upon at least 24 hour notice (except in an emergency), Lessee will allow Lessor or Lessor's agent free access at all reasonable times to the Demised Premises for the purpose of review and inspection of the Demised Premises or any property owned by or under the control of Lessor. Lessor shall have the right, at any time within six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Lease term, option term, or any option extension or renewal thereof, but not before, to place upon the Demised Premises any usual &quot;To Let&quot; or &quot;For Lease&quot; signs.</p>
          <p id="s1p152">10.2 Lessee's. Lessee shall have twenty-four (24) hours per day, 365 days per year access to the Demised Premises and all parking.</p>
          <p id="s1p153">11. Duties of Lessee Upon Termination:</p>
          <p id="s1p154">Upon termination of this Lease by expiration of its term or otherwise, Lessee shall quietly and peaceably quit and surrender possession of the Demised Premises to Lessor, in as good condition as when received, reasonable wear and tear excepted, together with all alterations, additions and improvements to the Demised Premises permitted under the provisions hereof to remain upon the said Demised Premises, and such possession shall be so surrendered without the necessity for any notice of demand therefore on the part of the Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p155">10</p>
          <p id="s1p156">12. Assignment:</p>
          <p id="s1p157">Lessee shall not assign, mortgage, or pledge any interest in the Demised Premises, without the prior approval of Lessor, expressed in writing, which said approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the above, any transfer by Lessee by merger, consolidation or liquidation or change in the ownership of Lessee, and any assignment by Lessee to a wholly-owned subsidiary or affiliate corporation, shall not constitute an assignment for the purposes of this Paragraph 12, but shall not release Lessee from liability hereunder, and Lessee will continue to be liable until released by Lessor or upon termination of this Lease. Lessor hereby consents to an assignment of this Lease to any entity to whom Lessee sells all or substantially all of its assets, provided that such entity expressly assumes all of Lessee's obligations hereunder, and provided further that Lessee shall not be released from liability hereunder in such event unless Lessor otherwise agrees in writing. Lessor further agrees that Lessee shall be entitled to sublease all or portions of the Demised Premises with Lessor's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), provided that such subletting is subject to the terms and provisions of this Lease and provided, further, that Lessee will continue to be liable until released by Lessor or upon termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p158">13. Subordination:</p>
          <p id="s1p159">Lessor represents and warrants to Lessee that Lessor is, or will be prior to the Commencement of Construction (as defined in Paragraph 31) of the Building, the sole owner in fee simple of the Demised Premises, and that on the date of Lessor's acquisition of title to the Demised Premises there are no mortgages or deeds of trust which encumber the Demised Premises. This Lease is subordinated at all times to the lien of any mortgages or deeds of trust hereafter placed upon Lessor's interest in the Demised Premises and upon the land or Demised Premises of which the Demised Premises are a part, or upon any other building hereafter placed on the property. Lessee covenants and agrees to execute and deliver, upon request of the Lessor, such further instruments evidencing such subordination as may be reasonably required by any such mortgagee or lender, title company or Lessor's counsel. This agreement to subordinate is expressly conditioned upon Lessor first obtaining from any such mortgagee or lender a written agreement that provides substantially the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p160">a. As long as Lessee performs its obligations under this Lease, no foreclosure of, deed given in lieu of foreclosure of, or sale under the encumbrance, and no steps or procedures taken under the encumbrance, shall affect Lessee's rights under this Lease. Lessee, as a condition of subordination, will receive from Lender an attornment and non-disturbance agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p161">b. The provisions of this Lease concerning the disposition of any condemnation award, shall prevail over any conflicting provisions in the encumbrance.</p>
          <p id="s1p162">c. Lessee shall attorn to any purchaser at any foreclosure sale, or to any grantee or transferee designated in any deed given in lieu of foreclosure.</p>
          <p id="s1p163">14. Insurance:</p>
          <p id="s1p164">14.1 General Requirements. At all times during the term of this Lease, Lessee, at Lessee's sole expense, shall maintain on the Building and improvements in which the Demised Premises are located, policies of insurance as referenced herein. All insurance coverage shall comply with the reasonable requirements of Lessor's lenders. All insurance policies maintained pursuant to this Paragraph shall be carried in favor of the Lessor, the Lessee, and any mortgagee or other secured party of the Demised Premises as their interests may appear. All insurance policies required herein shall be at the sole expense of the Lessee. All proceeds of any such insurance necessary to restore the Demised Premises shall be payable to Lessor and shall be applied to the restoration of said Building and Demised Premises to Lessee's satisfaction and to the extent provided in Paragraph 15, and any proceeds of such insurance remaining after such restorations shall belong to Lessee. All insurance shall be placed with</p>
          <p id="s1p165">11</p>
          <p id="s1p166">companies that are mutually acceptable to Lessor, Lessee and Lessor's lender. Lessee shall provide Lessor with a certificate of insurance and provide Lessor with thirty (30) days' notice prior to making any significant changes in insurance with respect to the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p167">14.2 Lessor's Physical Loss Insurance. Lessee, at Lessee's sole expense, shall maintain on the Building and improvements in which the Demised Premises are located, a policy of insurance in an amount equal to at least 100% of the full replacement value thereof. Insurance coverage shall insure against the risks commonly covered by an &quot;All Risk&quot; or &quot;Special Form&quot; insurance contract. Earthquake and flood coverage will be provided only if required by Lessor's lender. Coverage will be provided for loss of rents sufficient to cover a period of twelve (12) months.</p>
          <p id="s1p168">14.3 Liability Insurance. Lessor and Lessee shall each indemnify and hold the other harmless against all claims, demands and judgment for loss, damage or injury to property or persons resulting or accruing by reason of the use and occupancy of the Demised Premises and the sidewalks, parking areas, streets and ways in and/or adjacent thereto. Lessee shall procure and maintain, at Lessee's sole expense, a general broad form liability insurance policy, naming both the Lessor and the Lessee, against claims for injuries and/or damage to persons or property occurring in, upon, or about the Demised Premises. Such policy shall have a combined single limit coverage of not less than two million dollars ($2,000,000) during the first ten (10) years of the Initial Term and three million dollars ($3,000,000) thereafter.</p>
          <p id="s1p169">14.4 Combination Coverage. Should Lessee desire to carry the coverage specified herein in combination with insurance on other property owned or controlled by Lessee, Lessee shall deliver certificates of insurance from a mutually agreeable insurance company, naming Lessee as insured, with Lessor and Lessor's lender named as additional insureds. Any coverage under this Paragraph must be acceptable to Lessor's lenders. All proceeds of any such insurance shall be applied to restoration of said Building and Demised Premises to Lessee's satisfaction, and any proceeds of such insurance remaining after such restoration shall belong to Lessee. In the event Lessee elects to provide insurance coverage as set forth in this Paragraph, Lessee shall provide Lessor with an appropriate assignment of proceeds certificate.</p>
          <p id="s1p170">14.5 Waiver of Subrogation Rights. Lessor and Lessee do each release and relieve the other and their agents or employees from responsibility for and waive their entire claim of recovery for (i) any loss or damage to the real or personal property of either located anywhere upon the Demised Premises, arising out of or incident to the occurrence of any of the perils which may be covered by their respective casualty insurance policies, with extended coverage endorsements; or (ii) any loss resulting from business interruption insurance policy or by any loss of rental income insurance policy held by Lessor or Lessee. Each party shall cause its insurance carriers to consent to the waiver of all rights of subrogation against the other party.</p>
          <p id="s1p171">15. Destruction or Damage of Premises:</p>
          <p id="s1p172">In the event the Demised Premises is destroyed or damaged by fire, earthquake or other casualty covered by the insurance required to be carried by Lessee pursuant to Paragraph 14 above, then Lessor shall proceed with reasonable diligence to rebuild and restore the Demised Premises or such part thereof as may be damaged. In the event the Demised Premises are destroyed or injured by casualty not covered by insurance and Lessee has not agreed to finance or locate financing for the amount not covered by insurance, or in the event the Demised Premises is damaged in excess of 50% of the full replacement value thereof, Lessor may, within sixty (60) days after such destruction or damage, notify Lessee in writing of its election to terminate this Lease, in which event this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such damage (to the extent Lessee shall have already paid rent for any time after the date of such termination, Lessor shall promptly refund such amount to Lessee). Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in the event the Demised Premises are damaged to such an extent so as to require in excess of 270 days to rebuild or restore or are damaged during the last year of the term of</p>
          <p id="s1p173">12</p>
          <p id="s1p174">this Lease, Lessee may, by notice to Lessor within sixty (60) days after determination of the extent of the damage, terminate this Lease as of the date of damage (to the extent Lessee shall have already paid rent for any time after the date of such termination, Lessor shall promptly refund such amount to Lessee). In the event this Lease is not terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Section 15, Lessor shall diligently pursue reconstruction and during the period of such rebuilding and restoration, rent hereunder shall be abated in the same ratio as the portion of the Demised Premises rendered for the time being unfit for occupancy shall bear to the entire Demised Premises, provided that in the event more than fifty percent (50%) of the Demised Premises is rendered untenantable, all rent hereunder shall be abated in full.</p>
          <p id="s1p175">16. Taking of Demised Premises:</p>
          <p id="s1p176">If all of the Demised Premises shall be taken or appropriated for public or quasi-public use by right of eminent domain with or without litigation or transferred by agreement in connection with such public or quasi-public use, this Lease shall terminate as of the date possession is taken by the condemning authority. If any part (but less than all) of the Demised Premises shall be taken or appropriated for public or quasi-public use by right of eminent domain with or without litigation or transferred by agreement in connection with such public or quasi-public use, Lessee shall have the right at its option exercisable within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of such taking to terminate this Lease as of the date possession is taken by the condemning authority; provided, however, that before Lessee may terminate this Lease by reason of any partial taking or appropriation as provided hereinabove, such taking or appropriation shall be of such an extent and nature as to materially impair Lessee's use of the Demised Premises. No award for any partial or entire taking shall be apportioned; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give Lessor any interest in or to require Lessee to assign to Lessor any award made to Lessee for: (i) the taking of personal property and fixtures belonging to Lessee; (ii) interruption of or damage to Lessee's business; or (iii) Lessee's unamortized cost of leasehold improvements. In the event of a partial taking which does not result in a termination of this Lease, upon the date possession is taken by the condemning authority rent shall be abated in the proportion which the part of the Demised Premises so made unusable bears to the area of the Demised Premises immediately prior to the taking.</p>
          <p id="s1p177">17. Indemnification:</p>
