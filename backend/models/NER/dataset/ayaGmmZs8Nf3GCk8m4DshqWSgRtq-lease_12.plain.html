          <p id="s1p28">With the rent payment due on January 1st of each year, or at any time the Lessor may deem it necessary due to increase in expenses (during the Term and option periods), Lessee’s share of Building Expense increases shall be determined using the previous year’s or most current expense information. The total estimated annual Building Expense increases shall then be divided into twelve (12) monthly payments. Lessee shall then pay to Lessor its pro-rated share, as set forth in Section 4, of the total monthly Building Expense increases with the next rental payment due or beginning January 1st of each year of the Term and any extensions thereof. The estimated expenses in Exhibit “B” shall be the base amount used for all calculations in determining any increase in expenses during the term of this Lease and any extensions. The present estimate of annual Building Expenses is attached hereto as Exhibit “B.” Within 90 (ninety) days after the end of each calendar year, Lessor shall furnish to Lessee a statement showing the Building Expenses incurred by Lessor during the prior calendar year. Lessee shall pay to Lessor the excess of Lessee’s share of such building expenses over the amount paid by Lessee to Lessor for such purpose during the prior calendar year.

If Lessor, for any reason whatsoever, cannot deliver possession of the Premises to Lessee at the commencement of the Term, this Lease shall not be void or voidable, nor shall Lessor be liable to Lessee for any loss or damage resulting there from, but in that event all rent shall be abated during the period between commencement of the Term and the time when Lessor delivers possession. Lessor shall be deemed to have delivered possession by delivery of written notice to Lessee stating that the Premises are ready for occupancy.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">8. PURPOSE. Lessee shall use and occupy the Premises for general office purposes, and Lessee shall not use or occupy the Premises for any other purpose without the prior written consent of Lessor.</p>

The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Lessee in any action against Lessee, whether Lessor be a party thereto or not, that Lessee has violated any law, statute, ordinance or governmental rule, regulation or requirement, shall be conclusive of that fact as between Lessor and Lessee.</p>

          <p id="s1p38">(c) If Lessee shall make any alterations then Lessor may elect to require Lessee at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease to restore, at no cost to Lessor, the Premises to substantially the same condition as existed at the commencement of the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p39">(d) Lessee shall indemnify and save Lessor harmless from all liability, costs and attorney’s fees due to claims for the work, materials and obligations of Lessee or the enforcement of any lien caused by the Lessee’s alteration.

Lessee shall pay the entirety of any increase in the property insurance premium for the Building over what is was immediately prior to the commencement of the term of this Lease if the increase is specified by Lessor’s insurance carrier as being caused by the nature of Lessee’s occupancy or any act or omission of Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p51">(c) Liability Insurance-Lessee</p>
          <p id="s1p52">Lessee shall, at Lessee’s expense, carry and maintain personal injury liability insurance with minimum limits of $1 Million ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence insuring against all Lessee liability respecting the Premises, the Building, adjacent parking, areas of ingress and egress or arising from their maintenance, use or occupancy; and property damage liability insurance with minimum limits of $1 Million ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence.

If Lessor elects to repair or restore the Premises following damage or destruction, Lessee’s insurance proceeds shall be used to repair or replace Lessee’s trade fixtures and personal property. If Lessor elects not to repair or restore the Premises, Lessee shall retain such insurance proceeds.</p>
          <p id="s1p55">(e) Lessee and Lessor each releases and relieves the other, and on behalf of each of their respective insurers, waives the entire right of recovery against the other to the extent permitted by its insurance contracts, for loss or damage arising out of or incident to the peril of fire and such other perils ordinarily insured against by fire and extended coverage insurance policies, either due to the negligence of the other party or its authorized representatives and regardless of cause or origin.</p>

          <p id="s1p58">(h) Lessee shall not do, omit to do, or permit to be done any act or thing upon the Premises which will invalidate or be in conflict with any property insurance policy covering part or all of the Premises or the Building and the fixtures and property therein, and shall not do, omit to do or permit to be done any act or thing upon the Premises which shall or might subject Lessor to any liability or responsibility for injury to any person or persons or to property by reason of any such act or thing or omission.</p>
          <p id="s1p59">4</p>
          <p id="s1p60">(i) If, as a result of any act or omission by Lessee, the premium rate for property insurance applicable to the Premises or to the Building shall be increased to an amount higher than it otherwise would be, Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for all increases of fire insurance premiums so caused; such reimbursement shall be paid by Lessee within ten (10) days after delivery of a bill therefore.

          <p id="s1p64">In the event that Lessee requires excessive or specialized janitorial and/or maintenance services either due to Lessee’s special or unusual use of the Premises or because of a disregard by Lessee for normal maintenance, Lessee shall promptly pay to Lessor the additional cost and expenses Lessor incurs.</p>
          <p id="s1p65">Lessee will not, without the written consent of Lessor, use any apparatus or device in the Premises, including, but without limitation thereto, electronic data processing machines, punch card machines and machines using current in excess of 110 volts, which will in any way increase the amount of electricity or water usually furnished or supplied for use of the Premise as general office space; nor connect with electric current, except through existing electrical outlets in the Premises or water pipes, any apparatus or device, for the purposes of using electric current or water. If Lessee shall require water or electric current in excess of that usually furnished or supplied for use of the Premises as general office space, Lessee shall first procure the consent of Lessor, which Lessor may refuse, to the use thereof. Lessee’s Premises has a separate electrical meter and all electricity for lights, heating and air conditioning, and wall outlets within the Premises obtain power through this meter. Lessee is responsible for activation of the meter by the Electric Company and all electrical bills resulting from Lessee’s use of electricity for Premises.</p>

          <p id="s1p108">(c) If the Premises shall be partially damaged but shall nevertheless be tenantable and fit for occupancy as to a portion thereof, and if this Lease is not terminated by Lessor as herein provided, there shall be no abatement of rent and Lessor agrees to repair or restore the same with reasonable promptness. In the event Lessor terminates this Lease as provided in Section 20(a), Lessee shall pay rent for any portion of time following the effective date of the termination that Lessee actually occupied the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">(d) During such period as all or part of the Premises are untenantable and unfit for occupancy as a result of any such fire or other casualty or such declaration, then the rent shall be ratably abated (based on square footage of the area affected) until the Premises shall be repaired or restored. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, there shall be no abatement in rent if the cause of such fire or other casualty or such declaration shall have originated in the Premises unless such fire or other casualty or such declaration shall have been caused by or be the result of any negligence of Lessor; nor shall there in any event be any abatement in rent if such fire or other casualty or such declaration, regardless of point of origin, shall have been caused by or be the result of the negfigence or improper conduct of Lessee or Lessee’s authorized representatives.

          <p id="s1p112">(g) Lessee shall in no event be entitled to compensation or damages on account of annoyance or inconvenience arising out of the making of any repairs or restoration or an account of any destruction or casualty or on account of any termination of this Lease under this Section 20.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">(h) Lessor and Lessee agree that the rights and obligations of the parties for damage or destruction to the premises shall be governed by the terms of this Lease and Lessee waives any statutory or common law rights other than the rights contained herein, including, without limitation, the rights contained in the Arizona revised Statutes Section 33-343.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">21. EMINENT DOMAIN.</p>
          <p id="s1p115">If the interests of Lessor or Lessee, or both, in the Premises for all or any portion of the Term shall be acquired or condemned by eminent domain for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, or in the event of a sale or transfer in lieu of such acquisition or condemnation, then and in that event the Term shall cease and terminate from the date of the vesting of title in such acquiring or condemning entity. If the interests of Lessor or Lessee or both in only a portion of the Premises, for all or any portion of the Term, shall be so acquired, condemned or transferred, the Term shall cease and terminate as to the entire Premises, at Lessor’s option, exercisable by written notice to Lessee at any time prior to the tenth (10th) day following the date of the vesting of title in such acquiring or condemning entity. If such option to terminate is not exercised by Lessor, then this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as to the remaining portion of the Premises and a ratable adjustment of the rent payable by Lessee for the remaining portion of the Premises shall be made based upon the square footage of the remaining area. In any of the foregoing events Lessor shall be entitled to all compensation and awards arising out of or in connection with such condemnation or acquisition, except that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prevent Lessee from recovering from the condemning authority compensation for the taking of personal property or fixtures belonging to Lessee or for interruption or damage to Lessee’s business or for moving or other expenses to the extent any of the same are compensatable by law.</p>
          <p id="s1p116">8</p>
          <p id="s1p117">22. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLEASE.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">(a) Lessee shall not voluntarily or by operation of law assign, transfer, mortgage, sublet or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any part of Lessee’s interests in this Lease or in the premises, without Lessor’s prior written consent, which Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold. Such consent shall be based not only on the creditworthiness of the proposed Lessee but also on the intended use of the Premises and its compatibility with other uses and the potential for conflicts or disputes arising out of such new Lessee’s occupancy. Any attempted assignment, transfer, mortgage, encumbrance or subletting without such consent shall be void and shall constitute a breach of this Lease. Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for Lessor’s reasonable attorney fees for the processing of documentation of any requested assignment, transfer, hypothecation or subletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p119">(b) Regardless of Lessor’s consent, no subletting or assignment shall release Lessee of Lessee’s obligations or alter the primary liability of Lessee to pay the rent and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Lessee hereunder. The acceptance of rent by Lessor from any other person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Lessor of any provision thereof. Consent to one assignment or subletting shall not be deemed consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p120">(c) If Lessee desires to sublease the Premises or to assign this Lease to other than a subsidiary, parent or affiliated entity of Lessee, which Lessee controls or shall control, Lessee shall first notify Lessor of the proposed terms and conditions of such subletting or assignment. Lessor shall have the right of first refusal to enter into a direct Lessor-Lessee relationship between Lessor and such third party.</p>
          <p id="s1p121">(d) Notwithstanding Sections 22(a) and 22(e), Lessee shall have the right, without Lessor’s consent, to assign this Lease to a corporation with which it may form or with which Lessee may merge or consolidate, to any parent or subsidiary of Lessee or to a purchaser of substantially all of Lessee’s assets, if the assignee executes an agreement required by Lessor assuming Lessee’s obligations and if the assignee has a net worth after the assignment at least equal to (or greater than) the net worth of Lessee prior to the assignment.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">(e) Lessee immediately and irrevocably assigns to Lessor, as security for Lessee’s obligation under this Lease, all rent from any subletting of all or part of the Premises as permitted by this Lease, and Lessor, as assignee and as attorney-in-fact for Lessee, or in receiver for Lessee appointed on Lessor’s application, and collect such rent and apply it toward lessee’s obligations under this Lease; except that until the occurrence of an act of default by Lessee, release Lessee in any way under this Lease except for rent actually received by Lessor from the sublessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">(f) No interest of Lessee in this Lease shall be assignable by operation of law (including, without limitation, the transfer of this Lease by testacy or intestacy). Each of the following acts shall be considered an involuntary assignment:</p>
          <p id="s1p124">(i)If Lessee or any parent corporation of Lessee is or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or institutes a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">(ii)If a Writ of Attachment or execution is levied on this Lease or the Premises by a creditor of Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">(iii)If, in any proceeding or action to which Lessee is a party, a receiver is appointed with authority to take possession of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p127">(g) If a Writ of Attachment or execution is levied on this Lease, Lessee shall have sixty (60) days in which to cause the attachment or execution to be removed. If any involuntary proceeding in bankruptcy is brought against Lessee, or if a receiver is appointed, Lessee shall have ninety (90) days in which to have the involuntary proceeding dismissed or the receiver removed.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">(h) An involuntary assignment which is not remedied within the time limits above provided shall constitute a default by Lessee and this Lease shall not be treated as an asset of Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p129">(i) If Lessor sells or transfers all of the Premises, Lessor, on consummation of the sale or transfer, shall be released from any liability thereafter accruing under this Lease. If any security deposit or prepaid rent has been paid by Lessee, Lessor can transfer the security deposit or prepaid rent to Lessor’s successor and on such transfer Lessor shall be discharged from any further liability in reference to the security deposit or prepaid rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p130">23. DEFAULT.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">(a) The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a default by Lessee:</p>
          <p id="s1p132">(i)Failure to pay rent when due, if the failure continues for ten (10) days after notice has been given by Lessor to Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">(ii)Abandonment and vacation of the Premises (failure to occupy the Premises for 30 [thirty] consecutive days shall be deemed an abandonment and vacation unless Lessee shall have obtained Lessor’s prior written approval to such vacation.)</p>
          <p id="s1p134">(iii)Failure of Lessee to perform any other covenant of this Lease or the failure to perform is not cured within ten (10) days after notice has been given to Lessee. If the default cannot reasonably be cured within ten (10) days, Lessee shall not be in default of this Lease if Lessee commences to cure the default within the ten-day (10-day) period and diligently and in good faith continues to cure the default until fully remedied.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">(b) Notices given under this Section 23 shall specify the alleged default and the applicable Lease provision, and shall demand that Lessee perform the covenant of this Lease or pay the rent that is in arrears, as the case may be, within the applicable period of time, or quit the Premises. No such notice shall be deemed a forfeiture or a notice of termination of this Lease unless Lessor specifically so elects in the Notice (or in any subsequent notice).</p>
          <p id="s1p136">9</p>
          <p id="s1p137">24. REMEDIES.</p>
          <p id="s1p138">Lessor shall have the following remedies if Lessee commits a default. These remedies are not exclusive; they are cumulative in addition to any remedies now or later allowed by law:</p>
          <p id="s1p139">(a) Lessor can continue this Lease in effect as long as Lessor does not terminate Lessee’s right to possession, and Lessor shall have the right to collect rent when due. During the period Lessee is in default, Lessor can enter the Premises and re-let them or any part of them, to third parties for Lessee’s account. Lessee shall be liable immediately to Lessor for all costs Lessor incurs in re-letting the Premises, including, without limitation, brokers’ commissions, expense of remodeling the Premises required by the re-letting, legal fees incurred and like costs. Re-letting can be for a period shorter or longer than the remaining portion of the Term. Lessee shall pay to Lessor the rent due under this Lease on the dates the rent is due, less the rent Lessor receives from any re-letting.</p>
          <p id="s1p140">(b) Lessor can terminate Lessee’s right to possession of the Premises at any time while a default by Lessee has not been fully and completely remedied. No act by Lessor other than giving notice to Lessee specifically so specifying shall terminate this Lease. Acts of maintenance, efforts to re-let the Premises, or the appointment of a receiver on Lessor’s initiative to protect Lessor’s interest under this Lease shall not constitute a termination of Lessee’s right to possession. On termination, Lessor has the right to recover from Lessee:</p>
          <p id="s1p141">(i)The worth, at the time of the award, of the unpaid rent that had been earned at the time of termination of this Lease;</p>
          <p id="s1p142">(ii)The worth, at the time of the award, of the amount by which the unpaid rent that would have been earned after the date of termination of this Lease until the time of the award exceeds the amount of the loss of rent that Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided;</p>
          <p id="s1p143">(iii)The worth, at the time of the award, of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the Term after the time of the award exceeds the amount of the loss of rent that Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided; and</p>
          <p id="s1p144">(iv)Any other amount and court costs and legal fees necessary to compensate Lessor for all detriment proximately caused by Lessee’s default.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">“The worth, at the time of the award,” as used in this Section is to be computed by allowing interest thereon at the rate of 15 percent (15%) or at the highest rate then permitted by law, whichever is less.</p>
          <p id="s1p146">(c) If Lessee is in default of this Lease, Lessor shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to collect rent and conduct Lessee’s business, if other than of a professional nature. Neither the filing of a petition for the appointment of a receiver nor the appointment itself shall constitute an election by Lessor to terminate this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">(d) Lessor, at any time after Lessee commits a default, can cure the default at Lessee’s cost. If Lessor at any time, by reason of Lessee’s default, pays any sum or does any act that requires the payment of any sum, the sum paid by Lessor shall bear interest at the rate of 15 percent (15%) per annum or the highest legal rate, whichever is less, from the date the sum is paid by Lessor until Lessor is reimbursed by Lessee. The sum, together with interest thereon, shall constitute additional rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">25. LATE CHARGES.</p>
          <p id="s1p149">Lessee hereby acknowledges that late payment by Lessee of rent and other sums due hereunder will cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges and late charges which may be imposed on Lessor by the terms of any encumbrance upon the Premises. Accordingly, if any installment of rent or any other sum due from Lessee shall not be received by Lessor or Lessor’s designee within ten (10) days after such amount shall be due, Lessee shall pay to Lessor a late charge equal to 5 percent (5%) of such overdue amount; and if not received by Lessor or Lessor’s designee within 20 (twenty) days after such amount shall be due, Lessee shall pay to Lessor a late charge equal to 10 percent (10%) of such overdue amount. The parties hereby agree that such late charges represent a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Lessor will incur by reason of a late payment by Lessee. Acceptance of such late charge by Lessor shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee’s default with respect to such overdue amount, nor prevent Lessor from exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p150">If a delinquent installment of rent or any other sum due from Lessee shall not be received by Lessor until Lessor or Lessor’s attorney sends to Lessee a written notice of such default, Lessee agrees to reimburse Lessor for Lessor’s reasonable attorneys’ fees thus incurred in an amount not less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) nor more than One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) for each such written notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p151">26. LESSOR’S DEFAULT.</p>
          <p id="s1p152">Lessor shall not be in default under this Lease unless Lessee shall have given Lessor written notice of the breach; and, within 30 (thirty) days after notice, Lessor has not commenced and is not diligently prosecuting the cure to completion.</p>
          <p id="s1p153">10</p>
          <p id="s1p154">If Lessor is in default of this Lease, and as a consequence Lessee recovers a money judgment, such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received on execution of the judgment and levy against the right, title, and interest of Lessor in the Building, other improvements and land of which the Premises are part, and out of rent or other income from such real property receivable by Lessor or out of the consideration received by Lessor from the sale or other disposition of ail or any party of Lessor’s right, title and interest in the Building, other improvements and land of which the Premises are a part. Neither Lessor nor any of the individuals comprising the ownership designated as Lessor shall be personally liable for any deficiency.</p>
          <p id="s1p155">27. WAIVER.</p>
          <p id="s1p156">No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy of Lessor on any default by Lessee shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver. The receipt and acceptance by Lessor of delinquent rent shall not constitute a waiver of any other default; it shall constitute only a waiver of timely payment for the particular rent payment (or portion thereof) involved, but shall not constitute a waiver of any late payment, penalty or interest on the rental payment accepted by Lessor. No payment by Lessee or receipt by Lessor of a lesser amount than the base rent (or other sum due from Lessee to Lessor) shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest scheduled rent. Except as provided in Section 46, no endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent by Lessee shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Lessor may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Lessor’s right to recover the balance of such rent or pursue any other right or remedy provided herein or at law or in equity.</p>
          <p id="s1p157">No act or conduct of Lessor, including, without limitation, the acceptance of the keys to the premises shall constitute an acceptance of the surrender of the premises by Lessee before the expiration of the term. Only a notice to Lessee by Lessor shall constitute acceptance of the surrender of the premises and accomplish a termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p158">Lessor’s consent to or approval of any act by Lessee requiring Lessor’s consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary Lessor’s consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p159">Any waiver by Lessor of any default must be in writing and shall not be a waiver of any other default concerning the same or any other provision of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p160">28. HOLDING OVER.</p>
          <p id="s1p161">If, with Lessor’s consent, Lessee holds possession of the premises after the expiration of the term or any exercised option periods, Lessee shall become a Lessee from month to month upon the terms herein specified but at a base rent equivalent to the then prevailing fair market rental as determined by Lessor, payable in advance on or before or upon the first day of each month, and Lessee shall continue in possession until such tenancy shall be terminated by Lessor, or until Lessee shall have given to Lessor a written notice at least one month prior to the date of termination of such monthly tenancy of his intention to terminate such tenancy. Holding over rate will be at a minimum, the last full month’s rental rate plus 50 percent (50%) of that rental.</p>
          <p id="s1p162">29. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE.</p>

The certificate also shall state the amount of monthly rent, the dates to which the rent has been paid in advance, and the amount of any security deposit or prepaid rent. Failure to deliver the certificates within the ten (10) days of request therefore by either party shall be conclusive upon the party failing to deliver the certificate for the benefit of the party failing to deliver the certificate for the benefit of the party requesting the certificate and any successor to the party requesting the certificate, that this Lease is in full force and effect and has not been modified except as may be represented to the party requesting the certificate. If a party fails to deliver the certificate within the ten (10) days, the party failing to deliver the certificate irrevocably constitutes and appoints the other party as the party’s special attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver the certificate to any third party.</p>
          <p id="s1p164">30. ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT.</p>
          <p id="s1p165">Lessee agrees to comply with any reasonable request to execute an attornment document requested by any lender on the property of which the demised premises are a part.</p>

Notwithstanding such subordination, Lessee’s right to possession of the premises shall not be disturbed if Lessee is not in default of this Lease and so long as Lessee shall pay the rent and observe and perform all of the covenants of this Lease, unless this Lease is otherwise terminated pursuant to its terms. If any mortgagee, trustee or ground landlord shall elect to have this Lease prior to the lien of its mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease, and shall give written notice thereof to Lessee, this Lease shall be deemed prior to such mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease, whether this Lease is dated prior to or subsequent to the date of said mortgage, deed of trust or ground lease or the date of recording thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p168">11</p>
          <p id="s1p169">Lessee agrees to execute such documents as are required to effectuate such subordination or to make this Lease prior to the lien of any ground lease, mortgage or deed of trust, as the case may be, and failing to do so, within ten (10) days after written, demand, does hereby make, constitute and irrevocably appoint Lessor and Lessee’s special attorney-in-fact and in Lessee’s name, place and stead, so to do.</p>

          <p id="s1p171">In the event that either Lessor or Lessee brings any action or proceeding against the other for possession of the Premises or for the recovery of any sum due hereunder, or because of the breach of any provision hereof, or for any other relief against the other, declaratory or otherwise, including appeals there from, and whether being an action based upon a tort or contract, then the non-prevailing party, in any such proceedings shall pay to the other party to this Lease reasonable attorneys’ fees and all costs for such action or proceeding which shall be enforceable whether or not such action or proceeding is prosecuted to final judgment, and including an allowance for attorney’s fees for appeals and rehearings.</p>
