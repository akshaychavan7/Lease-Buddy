(b) On the Closing Date, the Initial Purchasers shall have received the opinions to be delivered to the parties pursuant to the Participation Agreement, dated -6- as of the Closing Date and addressed to the Initial Purchasers, of King &amp; Spalding, Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP and Mark Carlton, counsel for UCH and UCI, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Initial Purchasers.

UCH and UCI shall furnish to the Initial Purchasers such conformed copies of such documents, opinions, certificates, letters, schedules and instruments in such quantities as the Initial Purchasers shall reasonably request. Section 4. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) UCH and UCI agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Act&quot;) or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any Initial Purchaser or such controlling person may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto; or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state, in any Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and will reimburse, as incurred, the Initial Purchasers and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Initial Purchasers or such controlling person in connection with investigating, defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, UCH and UCI will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning the Initial Purchasers furnished to UCH or UCI, as the case may be, by the Initial Purchasers specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that UCH or UCI may otherwise have to the indemnified parties. UCH and UCI shall not be liable under this -8- Section 4 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without their prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Initial Purchasers shall not, without the prior written consent of UCH and UCI, effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which UCH and UCI are or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by UCH and UCI, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of UCH and UCI, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to UCH and UCI, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of UCH and UCI. (b) The Initial Purchasers agree to indemnify and hold harmless UCH and UCI, their respective directors, officers and each person, if any, who controls UCH and UCI within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which UCH and UCI or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated in the Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Initial Purchaser, furnished to UCH or UCI, as the case may be, by the Initial Purchasers specifically for use therein; and subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, will reimburse, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by UCH or UCI or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending against or appearing as a third party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Initial Purchasers may otherwise have to the indemnified parties. The Initial Purchasers shall not be liable under this Section 4 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without their consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Neither UCH nor UCI shall, without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers, effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Initial Purchaser is or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by any Initial Purchaser, which settlement or compromise would be applicable to the Initial Purchasers unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of the Initial Purchasers, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser. -9- (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 4 of notice of the commencement of any action for which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 4, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 4, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof in writing; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from any liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantive rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel in writing that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receipt by the indemnifying party of notice of the institution of such action, then, in each such case, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and approval by such indemnified party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 4 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, designated by the Initial Purchasers in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 4 or UCH or UCI in the case of paragraph (b) of this Section 4, representing all of the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action or actions) or (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. After such notice from the -10- indemnifying party to such indemnified party, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such indemnified party without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such indemnified party waived in writing its rights under this Section 4, in which case the indemnified party may effect such a settlement without such consent. (d) In circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 4 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), each indemnifying party, in order to provide for just and equitable contribution, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof). The relative benefits received by UCH and UCI on the one hand and any Initial Purchaser on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received bear to the total discounts and commissions or other compensation received by such Initial Purchaser with respect to the Notes purchased by such Initial Purchaser. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by UCH and UCI on the one hand, or such Initial Purchaser on the other, the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. UCH and UCI and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (d), no Initial Purchaser shall be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate exceed the total discounts, commissions and other compensation received by such Initial Purchaser, less the aggregate amount of any damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged omissions to state a material fact, and no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph (d), each person, if any, who controls an -11- Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Initial Purchasers, and each director of either UCH or UCI, each officer of either UCH or UCI and each person, if any, who controls either UCH or UCI within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as UCH or UCI, as the case may be. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 4 will be in addition to any liability that the indemnifying parties may otherwise have to the indemnified parties referred to above. Section 5. Certain Information. The statements set forth in the third paragraph and the second and third sentences in the fifth paragraph and the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth paragraphs under the heading &quot;Private Placement&quot; in the Memorandum constitute the only information furnished by the Initial Purchasers to UCH or UCI for the purposes of Sections 1(a) and 4 hereof (the &quot;Initial Purchaser Information&quot;). The statements set forth in the penultimate paragraph on page 11 and the last paragraph on page 85 on pages 37, 41, 53 through 55, 74, 75, 83 and F-1 through F-5 constitute the only information furnished by BRL and BRLC (the &quot;Issuer Information&quot;). Section 6. Survival Clause. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the other provisions of the Engagement Letter, the respective representations, warranties, agreements, covenants, indemnities and other statements of UCH and UCI, their respective officers and the Initial Purchasers set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of UCH or UCI, any of their respective officers or directors, the Initial Purchasers or any controlling person referred to in Section 4 hereof and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Notes. The respective agreements, covenants, indemnities and other statements set forth in Section 4 hereof shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement. Section 7. Other Agreements; Parties. Upon the execution hereof by the parties hereto, this Agreement shall be a binding agreement, in full force and effect, among the parties hereto. The Engagement Letter, as specifically supplemented hereby, shall continue to be in full force and effect and is in all respects ratified and confirmed, except with respect to Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 3(b) and 3(c) thereof, which are terminated and superseded in their entirety hereby. Section 8. Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the other provisions of the Engagement Letter, the Engagement Letter shall be deemed to be in full force and effect as supplemented by this Agreement; provided that this Agreement may be terminated at the same time as any termination of the Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that the indemnification provisions hereof set forth in Section 4 shall survive any such termination as provided in Section 6.
