          <p id="s1p83">THE EATON BANK LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p84">THIS LEASE is made on this 17th day at December, 1996, by STAGECOACH STOP, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Landlord”), and THE EATON BANK (“Tenant”).</p>
          <p id="s1p85">1. AGREEMENT</p>
          <p id="s1p86">Landlord leases the premises (as that term is defined in paragraph 2) to Tenant, and Tenant leases the premises from Landlord, according to this lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p87">2. PREMISES</p>
          <p id="s1p88">The premises are the land and building commonly known as 2700 47th Avenue, city of Greeley, County of Weld, State of Colorado, and more particularly described as set forth on Exhibit “A” attached and incorporated by reference.</p>
          <p id="s1p89">The premises include the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems; and the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems; and all other subsystems serving the premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p90">3. TERM</p>
          <p id="s1p91">a. Initial Term. The term of this lease will be ten (10) years, beginning on January 1, 1997, and expiring at midnight on December 31, 2006 unless Tenant exercises its option to extend.</p>
          <p id="s1p92">b. Option to Extend. Tenant shall have two (2) five year options to extend. Tenant may extend the term until the fifteenth anniversary of the expiration date by written notice of its election to do so given to Landlord at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the then effective expiration date. If Tenant has exercised its first five year option, Tenant may extend the term an additional five years by giving written notice at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the end of the first option extension. The terms and conditions of the lease applicable when the option is extended will govern the extended term.</p>
          <p id="s1p93">4. RENT</p>
          <p id="s1p94">Rent will be calculated on a rate per square foot which is agreed to be $15.00 per square foot for years 1 through 5. The Landlord and Tenant agree that there are nine thousand four hundred (9400) square feet in the premises. For each of the first initial 60 months of the lease, Tenant will pay Landlord Eleven Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty ($11,750) Dollars (the “monthly rent”) in equal consecutive monthly installments on or before the first day of each successive month during the term of this lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p95">Commencing with the sixty-first (61st) month of the initial ten year term, the rent shall be increased not less than ten (10%) percent. The rent may be increased more than ten (10%) percent, to the extent and percentage that the “prime rate” at that time is higher than the present 8.25%. But, regardless of the then prime rate, the increase in monthly rent due and payable may not exceed twenty (20%).</p>
          <p id="s1p96">If, and only if, the options to extend are exercised by Tenant and there is thus an obligation of the Tenant to pay rent, the rent for months one hundred and twenty-one (121) through one hundred and eighty (180) and for months one hundred and eighty-one (181) through two hundred and forty (240) will be recalculated. The base for recalculation shall be the rent payable for month 120 for the first extension, and, if applicable because Tenant shall have exercised its second five year option, for month 180 for the second extension. There shall be a minimum increase often (10%) percent and a maximum increase of twenty (20%) percent of the monthly rent commencing with months 121 and 181. The term “prime rate” which is the basis for the recalculations means “The national corporate prime rate as published in the Money Rates section of the Wall Street Journal and defined as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 75% of the nation’s 30 largest banks. If this publication is canceled, or the index is significantly modified, a reasonable functional successor of this index readily available to the public will be used.”</p>
          <p id="s1p97">If Tenant, at its own cost, adds square footage to the premises during the term of this lease, or any extension, these additions will not be included as additional rent or added to the above agreed square footage subject to rent. At the conclusion of this lease, the additional square footage shall either be removed at the direction of the Landlord by the Tenant, at the Tenant’s sole expense restoring the Premises to its condition prior to the addition, or shall become, without any further charge, the property of the Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p98">The monthly rent will be paid in advance at the address specified for Landlord or such other place as Landlord designates, without prior demand. If the actual commencement date occurs on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, or if the actual expiration date occurs on a day other than the last day of a calendar month, then the monthly rent for the fractional month will be prorated on a daily basis.</p>
          <p id="s1p99">5. TAXES</p>
          <p id="s1p100">a. Obligation for Payment. Tenant will pay all taxes (collectively the “tax”), including without limitation real estate and personal property taxes and assessments assessed, levied, confirmed, or imposed during the term of this lease, whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of Landlord and Tenant:</p>
          <p id="s1p101">i. upon, measured by, or reasonably attributable to the cost or value of Tenant’s equipment, furniture, fixtures, and other personal property located in the premises, or by the cost or value of any leasehold improvements made in or to the premises by or for Tenant, regardless of whether title to the improvements is in Tenant or Landlord;</p>
          <p id="s1p102">The Eaton Bank Lease 2</p>
          <p id="s1p103">ii. upon or measured by the monthly rent, including without limitation any gross receipts tax or excise lax levied by the federal government or any other governmental body with respect to the receipt of monthly rent;</p>
          <p id="s1p104">iii. upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use, or occupancy by Tenant of the premises or any portion of the premises;</p>
          <p id="s1p105">iv. upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the premises;</p>
          <p id="s1p106">v. upon the premises and all personal property, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and all replacements, improvements, or additions to them, whether owned by Landlord or Tenant; and;</p>
          <p id="s1p107">vi. based in whole or in part on a monthly rent, whether made in addition or in substitution for any other tax.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">b. Taxes Payable in Installments. Unless Landlord has exercised its rights under paragraph 5(f) and if, by law, any tax may at the option of the taxpayer be paid in installments (whether or not interest accrues on the unpaid balance of the tax), Tenant may exercise the option to pay the tax (and any accrued interest on the unpaid balance of the tax) in installments; in that event, Tenant will pay the installments that become due during the term or this lease as they become due and before any fine, penalty, further interest, or cost may be added to them.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">c. Taxes for Period Other Than Term. Any tax’ including taxes that have been converted into installment payments, relating to a fiscal period of the taxing authority, a part of which period is included within the term and a part of which is included in a period of time prior to the commencement or after the end of the term, whether or not such tax or installments are assessed, levied, confirmed, imposed upon or in respect of, or become a lien upon the premises, or become payable, during the term, will be adjusted between Landlord and Tenant as of the commencement or end of the term, so that Tenant will pay that portion of the tax or installment which the part of the fiscal period included in the term bears to the fiscal period, and Landlord will pay the remainder.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">d. Other Impositions. Tenant will not be obligated to pay local, state, or federal net income taxes assessed against Landlord; local, state, or federal capital levy of Landlord; or sales, excise, franchise, gift, estate, succession, inheritance, or transfer taxes of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">e. Right to Contest Taxes. Tenant will have the right to contest the amount or validity, in whole or in part, of any tax by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted in good faith, only after paying the tax or posting such security as Landlord may reasonably require in order to protect the premises against loss or forfeiture. Upon the termination of those proceedings, Tenant will pay the amount of the tax or part of the tax as finally determined, the payment of which may</p>
          <p id="s1p112">The Eaton Bank Lease 3</p>
          <p id="s1p113">have been deferred during the prosecution of the proceedings, together with any costs, fees, interest, penalties, or other related liabilities. Landlord will not be required to join in any contest or proceedings unless the provisions of any laws or regulations then in effect require that the proceedings be brought by or in the name of Landlord. In that event, Landlord will join in the proceedings or permit them to be brought in its name; however, Landlord will not be subjected to any liability for the payment of any costs or expenses in connection with any contest or proceedings, and Tenant will Indemnify- Landlord against and save Landlord harmless from any of those costs and expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">f. Estimated Payments. If any lender requires Landlord to do so, then, in each December during the term or as soon after December as practicable, Landlord will give Tenant written notice of its estimate of amounts payable under this paragraph S for the ensuing calendar year. On or before the first day of each month during the ensuing calendar year, Tenant will pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12th) of the estimated amounts; however, if notice is not given in December, Tenant will continue to pay on the basis of the prior year’s estimate until the month after notice is given. If at any time or times it appears to Landlord that the amounts payable under this paragraph 5 for the current calendar year will vary from its estimate by more than ten percent (10%), Landlord will, by written notice to Tenant revise its estimate for the year, and subsequent payments by Tenant for such year will be based upon the revised estimate.</p>
          <p id="s1p115">g. Final Settlement. Within ninety (90) days after the close of each calendar year or as soon after the ninety-day period as practicable, Landlord will deliver to Tenant a statement of amounts payable under paragraph S for the calendar year, prepared by certified public accountants designated by Landlord or prepared by Landlord and certified by one of its officers. The certified statement will be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. If the statement shows an amount owing by Tenant that is less than the estimated payments previously made by Tenant for the calendar year, the statement will be accompanied by a refund of the excess paid by Landlord to Tenant. If the statement shows an amount owing by Tenant that is more than the estimated payments previously made by Tenant for the calendar year, Tenant will pay the deficiency to Landlord within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the statement.</p>
          <p id="s1p116">6. UTILITIES</p>
          <p id="s1p117">Tenant will pay the appropriate suppliers for all water, gas, electricity, light, heat, telephone, power, and other utilities and communications services used by Tenant on the premises during the term, whether or not the services are billed directly to Tenant. Tenant will also procure, or cause to be procured, without cost to Landlord, any and all necessary permits, licenses, or other authorizations required for the lawful and proper installation and maintenance upon the premises of wires, pipes, conduits, tubes, and other equipment and appliances for use in supplying any of the services to and upon the premises. Landlord, upon request of Tenant, and at the sole expense and liability of Tenant, will join with Tenant in any application required for obtaining or continuing any of the services.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">The Eaton Bank Lease 4</p>
          <p id="s1p119">7. INSURANCE</p>
          <p id="s1p120">a. “All-Risk” Coverage. Tenant will, at its sole expense, obtain and keep in force, during the term of this lease, “all-risk” coverage insurance (excluding earthquake and flood insurance) naming Landlord and Tenant as their interest may appear and other parties that Landlord or Tenant may designate as additional insureds in the customary form in the City of Greeley for buildings and improvements of similar character, on all buildings and improvements now or after this date located on the premises. The amount of the insurance will be designated by Landlord no more frequently than once every twelve (12) months, will be set forth on an “agreed amount endorsement” to the policy of insurance, will not be less than the agreed value of the buildings and improvements, and will be subject to arbitration as set forth below if Landlord and Tenant do not agree with regard to such value. Landlord and Tenant agree that the value of the existing building on the premises is One Million One Hundred Thousand ($1,100,000) Dollars.</p>
          <p id="s1p121">b. General Liability. Tenant will, at is sole expense, obtain and keep in force during the term of this lease commercial general liability insurance with a combined single limit of not less than Five Hundred Thousand ($500,000) Dollars for injury to or death of any one person, for injury to or death of any number of persons in one occurrence, and for damage to property, insuring against any and all liability of Landlord and Tenant, including without limitation coverage for contractual liability, broad form property damage, host liquor liability, and non-owned automobile liability, with respect to the premises or arising out of the maintenance, use, or occupancy of the premises. The insurance will insure the performance by Tenant of the indemnity agreement as to liability for injury to or death of persons and damage to property set forth in paragraph 20. The insurance will be noncontributing with any insurance that may be carried by Landlord and will contain a provision that Landlord, although named as an insured, will nevertheless be entitled to recover under the policy for any loss, injury, or damage to Landlord, its agents, and employees, or the property of such persons. The limits and coverage of all the insurance will be adjusted by agreement of Landlord and Tenant during every third Lease year during the term of this lease in conformity with the then prevailing custom of insurance liability in the City of Greeley and any disagreement regarding the adjustment will be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">c. Other Matters. All insurance required in this paragraph and all renewals of it will be issued by companies authorized to transact business in the State of Colorado and rated at least A+ Class X by Best’s Insurance Reports (property liability) or approved by Landlord. All insurance policies will be subject to approval by Landlord and any lender as to form and substance; will expressly provide that the policies will not be canceled or altered without thirty (30) days’ prior written notice (to Landlord and any lender, in the case of “all-risk” coverage insurance, and to Landlord, in the case of general liability insurance); and will, to the extent obtainable, provide that no act or omission of Tenant which would otherwise result in forfeiture or reduction of the insurance will affect or limit the obligation of the insurance company to pay the amount of any loss sustained. Tenant may satisfy its obligation under this paragraph by appropriate endorsements of its blanket insurance policies.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">The Eaton Bank Lease 5</p>
          <p id="s1p124">d. Additional Insureds. All polices of liability insurance that Tenant is obligated to maintain according to this lease (other than any policy of workmen’s compensation insurance) will name Landlord and such other persons or firms as Landlord specifies from time to time as additional insureds. Original or copies of original policies (together with copies of the endorsements naming Landlord, and any others specified by Landlord, as additional insureds) and evidence of the payment of all premiums of such policies will be delivered to Landlord prior to Tenant’s occupancy of the premises and from time to time at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term of each policy. All public liability, property damage liability, and casualty policies maintained by Tenant will be written as primary policies, not contributing with and not in excess of coverage that Landlord may carry. No insurance required to be maintained by Tenant by this paragraph will be subject to any deductible without Landlord’s prior written consent.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">e. Waiver. Landlord and Tenant waive all rights to recover against each other or against each other Tenant or occupant of the building, or against the officers, directors, shareholders, partners, joint venturers, employees, agents, customers, invitees, or business visitors of each of theirs or of any other Tenant or occupant of the building, for any loss or damage arising from any cause covered by any insurance required to be carried by each of them pursuant to this paragraph 7 or any other insurance actually carried by each of them. Landlord and Tenant will cause their respective insurers to issue appropriate waiver of subrogation rights endorsements to all policies of insurance carried in connection with the building or the premises or the contents of either of them. Tenant will cause all other occupants of the premises claiming by, under, or through Tenant to execute and deliver to Landlord a waiver of claims similar to the waiver in this paragraph and to obtain such waiver of subrogation rights endorsements.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">8. USE</p>
          <p id="s1p127">The premises will be used primarily for banking, insurance, securities, and related financial services.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">9. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS (GENERALLY)</p>
          <p id="s1p129">a. Tenant’s Obligations. Tenant will not use or occupy, or permit any portion of the premises to be used or occupied:</p>
          <p id="s1p130">i. in violation of any law, ordinaries, order, rule, regulation, certificate of occupancy, or other governmental requirement;</p>
          <p id="s1p131">ii. for any disreputable business or purpose; or</p>
          <p id="s1p132">iii. in any manner or for any business or purpose that creates risks of fire or other hazards, or that would in any way violate, suspend, void, or increase the rate of fire or liability or any other insurance of any kind at any time carried by Landlord upon all or any part of the building in which the premises are located or its contents.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">The Eaton Bank Lease 6</p>
          <p id="s1p134">Tenant will comply with all laws, ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, and other governmental requirements relating to the use, condition, or occupancy of the premises, and all rules, orders, regulations, and requirements of the board of fire underwriters or insurance service office, or any other similar body, having jurisdiction over the building in which the premises are located.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">b. Tenant’s Obligations with Respect to Environmental Laws. Landlord will hold Tenant harmless from any environmental claims arising from conditions in existence at the time of commencement of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p136">i. Tenant and the premises will remain in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations (including consent decrees and administrative orders) relating to public health and safety and protection of the environment, including those statues, laws, regulations, and ordinances identified in subparagraph vii, all as amended and modified from time to time (collectively, “environmental laws”).

If this lease is terminated pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph _, Tenant will remain liable to Landlord for damages in an amount equal to the rent and other sums that would have been owing by Tenant under this lease for the balance of the term if this lease had not been terminated, less the net proceeds, if any, of any reletting of the premises by Landlord subsequent to the termination, after deducting all Landlord’s reasonable expenses in connection with reletting, including without limitation the expenses set forth in paragraph 24.c.ii. Landlord will be entitled to collect damages from Tenant monthly on the days on which the rent and other amounts would have been payable under this lease if this lease had not been terminated, and Landlord will be entitled to receive damages from Tenant on each day.

          <p id="s1p258">rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of rent loss that Tenant proves could reasonably have been avoided;</p>
          <p id="s1p259">(3) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term of this lease after the time of award exceeds the amount of rent loss that Tenant proves could reasonably be avoided; and</p>
          <p id="s1p260">(4) any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result from the failure.</p>
          <p id="s1p261">The “worth at the time of award” of the amount referred to herein is computed by allowing interest at the lesser of 18% per annum or the highest rate permitted by law. The “worth at the time of award” of the amount referred to herein is computed by discounting the amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City at the time of award.</p>

          <p id="s1p263">ii. without demand or notice, re-enter and take possession of the premises or any part of the premises; repossess the premises as of the Landlord’s former estate; expel the Tenant from the premises and those claiming through or under Tenant; and remove the effects of both or either, without being deemed guilty of any manner of trespass and without prejudice to any remedies for arrears of rent or preceding breach of covenants or conditions. If Landlord elects to re-enter as provided in this paragraph 24.c.ii., or if Landlord takes possession of the premises pursuant to legal proceedings or pursuant to any notice provided by law, Landlord may, from time to time, without terminating this lease, relet the premises or any part of the premises, either alone or in conjunction with other portions of the building of which the premises are a part, in Landlord’s or Tenant’s name but for the account of Tenant, for the term or terms (which may be greater or less than the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the term of this lease) and on such terms and conditions (which may include concessions of free rent, and the alteration and repair of the premises) as Landlord, in its uncontrolled discretion, may determine. Landlord may collect and receive the rents for the premises. Landlord will not be responsible or liable for any failure to relet the premises, or any part of the premises, or for any failure to collect any rent due upon the reletting. No re-entry or taking possession of the premises by Landlord will be construed as an election on Landlord’s part to terminate this lease unless a written notice of the intention is given to Tenant. No notice from Landlord under this lease or under a forcible entry and detainer statute or similar law will constitute an election by Landlord to terminate this lease unless the notice specifically says so. Landlord reserves the right following any re-entry or reletting, or both, to exercise its right to terminate this lease by giving Tenant written notice, and in that event the lease will terminate as specified in the notice. If Landlord elects to take possession of the premises according to this paragraph 24.c.ii. without terminating the lease, Tenant will pay Landlord the rent and other sums which would be payable under this lease if the repossession had not occurred, less the net proceeds, if any, of any reletting of the premises after deducting all of Landlord’s expenses incurred in connection with the reletting,</p>

          <p id="s1p265">including without limitation all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, legal expenses, attorneys’ fees, expenses of employees, alteration, remodeling and repair costs, and expenses of preparation for the reletting. If; in connection with any reletting, the new lease term extends beyond the existing term, or the premises covered by the reletting include areas that are not part of the premises, a fair apportionment of the rent received from the reletting and the expenses incurred in connection with the reletting will be made in determining the net proceeds received from reletting. In addition, in determining the net proceeds from reletting, any rent concessions will be apportioned over the term of the new lease. Tenant will pay the amounts to Landlord monthly on the days on which the rent and all other amounts owing under this lease would have been payable if possession had not been retaken, and Landlord will be entitled to receive the rent and other amounts from Tenant on each day.</p>
