If, by or through condemnation proceedings, (i.e., a taking under the power of eminent domain or a sale under a threat of condemnation), more than fifteen (15%) percent of the Property or any buildings built thereon is permanently taken or access to and from the Property from and to either N.W. 107th Avenue or N.W. 19th Street is taken or ten (10%) percent or more of the parking area of the Property is taken or if any portion of the common area of the Property is taken which materially and substantially impairs access to the Property, then the Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Ground Lease upon giving the Landlord written notice thereof within thirty (30) days from the entry of an appropriate order of taking in such condemnation proceeding. B. If a portion of the Property or any buildings built thereon is taken under circumstances that do not give the Tenant the option to terminate as set forth above or, having such option to terminate, the Tenant elects not to terminate, the Rent payable hereunder shall be reduced annually by an amount equal to nine (9%) percent of the amount received by the Landlord (or its mortgage holder) as a result of such condemnation proceeding. C. If a portion of the Premises is taken under circumstances that do not give the Tenant the option to terminate as set forth above, the Tenant shall make repairs to the buildings and improvements on the Property to the extent necessary to restore the same to a complete architectural unit (to the extent permitted, however, taking into consideration the amount of land remaining after any such taking or purchase). D. If a portion of the Property of sufficient size and type to confer upon the Tenant the right to terminate this Ground Lease be so taken in such proceedings, and if the remaining Property can be substantially restored so that the Tenant in its opinion can conduct the business it is then operating upon said Property on a reasonably profitable basis, this Ground Lease shall not terminate, but shall continue with a reduction in the rental equal to nine (9%) percent of the amount received by the Landlord (or its mortgage holder) as a result of such condemnation proceeding. 8.02 AWARD.

The Tenant shall have the absolute right, without the required consent of the Landlord, to sublet the whole or any part of the Premises at any time during the term of this Ground Lease to such person or persons and upon such terms and conditions as the Tenant shall, in its absolute discretion, deem fit and proper, provided, however, that the Tenant shall remain primarily liable under this Ground Lease notwithstanding any such subleasing. The Tenant shall have the absolute right, without the prior consent of the Landlord, to assign this Ground Lease in whole or in part, provided, however, that the Tenant shall remain primarily liable under this Ground Lease notwithstanding any such assignment unless such assignee: (i) has a net worth equal to or greater than Three Million ($3,000,000.00) Dollars; (ii) owns, owned, and/or developed at lease One Hundred Thousand (100,000) leasable square feet of retail space; and (iii) assumes and agrees in writing to perform and observe all of the obligations to be performed and observed by the Tenant and to be bound by all other provisions of this Ground Lease, in which event the Tenant shall be relieved of all liability hereunder.

The Landlord shall, from time to time, upon the request of the Tenant, enter into agreements with the Tenant and the subtenants providing that in the event of termination of this Ground Lease the possession of any such subtenant will not be disturbed so long as the subtenant is not in default under its sublease with the Tenant, and the subtenant has not prepaid any rent, if the subtenant agrees that upon request of the Landlord following a termination of this Ground Lease, to attorn to the Landlord, to execute and deliver such instruments as the Landlord shall reasonably request to confirm such attornment, and such subtenant agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of Section 3.02. ARTICLE X LIENS OR ENCUMBRANCES 10.01 LIENS; ENCUMBRANCES. A. The Tenant shall not encumber the Landlord's fee simple interest in the Premises with mortgages or otherwise, including liens for improvements made by the Tenant. Any consents the Landlord gives to the Tenant to allow the Tenant to construct building improvements on the Premises or to make any alterations or additions thereto shall not be deemed improvements required by an agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant, within the meaning of the Florida Construction Lien Law. All contractors, subcontractors, mechanics, laborers, materialmen and others who perform any work, labor or services, or furnish any materials or otherwise participate in any improvements to the Premises, and who are not acting pursuant to a direct contract with the Landlord, are hereby given notice that the Tenant is not authorized to subject the Landlord's interest in the Premises to any claim for construction, laborers, materialmen's liens, or other liens, and all persons dealing directly or indirectly with the Tenant may not look to the Premises as security for payment. Pursuant to FLORIDA STATUTE Section 713.10, the interest of the Landlord in the Premises as owner of the Premises shall not be subject to liens for improvements made by the Tenant. B. If any construction or other liens shall be filed against the Premises or any improvements thereon by reason of or arising out of any labor or material furnished or alleged to have been furnished or to be furnished to or for the Tenant at the Premises or by reason of any charges, alterations, or additions or costs or expenses thereof, or any contract relating thereto, the Tenant shall within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of the filing thereof, either pay or bond the same or procure the discharge thereof in such manner as may be provided by law. The Tenant at its sole cost and expense, shall also defend on behalf of the Landlord any action, suit or proceedings which may be brought for the enforcement of such lien or liens, and the Tenant shall pay any damage and discharge any judgment entered thereon, and save harmless the Landlord from any claim or damage resulting therefrom. If the Tenant shall fail to cause such lien to be discharged within the period aforesaid, then, in addition to other right or remedy, the Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, discharge the same either by paying the amount claimed to be due or by procuring the discharge of such lien by deposit or by bonding proceedings. Any amount so paid by the Landlord and all costs and expenses incurred by the Landlord in connection therewith, together with the - 9 - interest thereon at four (4%) percent per annum over and above the &quot;prime rate&quot; announced from time to time by THE WALL STREET JOURNAL as its &quot;prime rate&quot;, from the respective dates of the Landlord's making of the payment or incurring of the cost and expense shall constitute additional rent payable by the Tenant under this Ground Lease and shall be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord on demand. ARTICLE XI LANDLORD'S RIGHT TO CONVEY 11.01 CONVEYANCE OF FEE. The Landlord shall have the right at all times to sell the Premises, subject to all the terms, covenants and conditions of this Ground Lease. Upon the sale of the Premises, the Landlord shall be relieved from the Landlord's obligations under this Ground Lease from and after the date such sale is consummated. 11.02 ATTORNMENT. No provision of this Ground Lease shall preclude Landlord from placing Landlord's Liens on Landlord's interest in the Property or amending such Landlord's Liens, provided that any grant of a Landlord's Lien by Landlord shall encumber only Landlord's fee interest and shall not purport to encumber Tenant's leasehold interest. So long as the Ground Lease is in full force and effect, Tenant agrees, upon request of Landlord, to furnish to Landlord a certificate in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and the holder of any Landlord's Lien that confirms (i) Tenant is bound under all of the terms and provisions of the Ground Lease; (ii) in the event the holder of any Landlord's Lien or foreclosure purchaser (hereinafter, a &quot;Fee Acquiring Party&quot;) shall acquire fee title to the Premises, Tenant will attorn to the Fee Acquiring Party; and (iii) there is no default of Landlord under the Ground Lease as of the date prior to the date of certificate other than defaults stated with specificity in the certificate. In such event, such Fee Acquiring Party shall be entitled to all of the rights of Landlord under the Ground Lease as though the interest of Landlord had not been terminated or such foreclosure proceedings had not been instituted; Tenant shall have the same rights and remedies against the Fee Acquiring Party that Tenant might have had under the Ground Lease against Landlord if the Fee Acquiring Party had not succeeded to the interest of Landlord, subject to the waiver of defaults not stated in the certificate described above. Such attornment by the Tenant to the Fee Acquiring Party or any successor thereof shall be effective and self-operative without the execution of any further instruments by any party hereto; provided, however, that the Tenant will, upon request execute a written agreement attorning to such Fee Acquiring Party, affirming the Tenant's obligations under the Lease. In the event that the Fee Acquiring Party succeeds to the interest of the Landlord under the Lease, or title to the Premises, then such Fee Acquiring Party and any successor thereof shall assume and be bound by the obligations of the Landlord under the Lease which accrue from and after such party's succession to the Landlord's interest in the Property, but such party shall not be: (i) liable for any act or omission of any prior landlord (including the Landlord); (ii) liable for the retention, application or return of any security deposit to the extent not paid over to such party; (iii) subject to any offsets or defenses which the Tenant might have against any prior landlord (including the Landlord); (iv) bound by any rent or additional rent which the Tenant might have paid for more than the current month to any prior landlord (including the Landlord); (v) bound by any amendment or modification of the Lease made without such party's prior written consent; or (vi) obligated to cure any defaults of any prior landlord under the Lease which occurred prior to the date on which such party succeeded to the Landlord's interest under the Lease. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to waive any of the Tenant's rights and remedies against any prior landlord. 11.03 TENANT'S CERTIFICATES. The Tenant agrees that it will, within thirty (30) days after request therefor, sign estoppel letters indicating the then standing of the Ground Lease. 11.04 LANDLORD'S ASSIGNMENT.

ARTICLE XII DEFAULT 12.01 DEFAULT BY THE TENANT. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a default (&quot;Default&quot; or &quot;Event of Default&quot;) under this Ground Lease: - 10 - A. The Tenant's failure to pay Rent or ad valorem taxes attributable to the Property when due where such failure continues for a period of ten (10) days after the Tenant receives written notice thereof from the Landlord; B.

The Tenant's failure to perform or comply with any of the other terms, provisions and covenants of this Ground Lease within forty-eight (48) hours if the failure to perform or comply causes an emergency situation or that which constitutes a nuisance or public health hazard or violation, or otherwise within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Tenant of written notice of such non-performance from the Landlord; or as to any non-performance not curable by reasonable effort within the thirty (30) calendar day period, failure to institute appropriate action to cure such non-performance within the thirty (30) calendar day period and thereafter to prosecute such action with due diligence and continuity; or D. A general assignment for the benefit of the Tenant's creditors or the filing of a voluntary petition by the Tenant in bankruptcy, or the entry of a decree involuntarily adjudicating the Tenant a bankrupt (and such involuntary decree is not dissolved within sixty [60] days), or an admission by the Tenant in writing of its insolvency or inability to pay its debts; or if the leasehold interest under this Ground Lease be taken by operation of law. 12.02 LANDLORD'S RIGHTS UPON DEFAULT. A. Upon a Default the Landlord may, at its option, and in addition to such other rights and remedies as the Landlord may have at law or in equity, at any time after such occurrence: (i) terminate this Ground Lease by written notice to the Tenant, whereupon this Ground Lease shall end, provided that such termination of this Ground Lease shall not relieve the Tenant of its liabilities and obligations under this Ground Lease; or (ii) elect to declare the entire Net Minimum Rent for the balance of the term immediately due and payable in which event Tenant shall be liable for the difference between the present value of all such Net Minimum Rent less the present value of the fair rental value of the Premises for the balance of the term, all reduced to present value at the rate of twelve (12%) percent per annum; or (iii) as the Tenant's agent, without terminating this Ground Lease, enter upon and rent the Premises at the best price obtainable by reasonable effort, with or without advertisement, and by private negotiation, for any term the Landlord deems proper; and the Tenant shall remain liable to the Landlord for the deficiency, if any, between the rental and other sums payable by the Tenant hereunder and the rent obtained by the Landlord on reletting, after deducting any attorneys' fees, commissions and other expenses paid by the Landlord with respect to such reletting. The Landlord shall in no way be responsible or liable for any failure to relet the Premises or any part thereof or for any failure to collect any rent due upon such reletting; or (iv) to re-enter and remove all persons and property from the Premises in accordance with Florida law, and such property may be removed and disposed of or stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of the Tenant, and without being deemed guilty of trespass, or becoming liable for any loss or damage which may be occasioned thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Ground Lease, the Landlord shall not re-enter or retake possession of the Premises except pursuant to all lawful process. Any valuables, personalty or other property of the Tenant's clients, customers or beneficiaries who have subtenant rights pursuant to Section 9.02 above shall not be deemed to be the property of the Tenant under the Ground Lease, and the Landlord shall have no claims, rights, liens or interests therein. B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no termination of this Ground Lease or summary proceedings, abandonment or vacancy shall relieve the Tenant of its liability and obligation under this Ground Lease, whether or not the Premises shall be relet. Nothing contained herein shall - 11 - limit the Landlord's right to exercise any or all other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the right to restraining orders, injunctions, decrees of specific performance, and to have a receiver appointed to take possession of the Premises. No delay or omission of the Landlord to exercise any right, power or remedy arising from any omission, neglect or default of the Tenant shall impair any such right, power or remedy or be construed as a waiver of any such default or any acquiescence therein.

Conditioned upon the Tenant paying all Rent required to be paid by the Tenant and the Tenant's performance of all covenants required under the terms of this Ground Lease, the Tenant shall lawfully, peaceably and quietly hold, occupy and enjoy the Premises during the Term, without hindrance, ejection or molestation. 13.02 POSSESSION. The Tenant shall be entitled to possession of the Premises on the date hereof. ARTICLE XIV RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF LEASEHOLD MORTGAGES 14.01 RIGHT TO ENCUMBER. Nothing in this Ground Lease shall restrict Tenant from encumbering, and Tenant shall have the right to encumber all of Tenant's leasehold interest under this Ground Lease and all of Tenant's interest in the Premises and the improvements, furnishings, furniture, equipment, fixtures and personal property thereon, from time to time by one (but not more than once at any one time) leasehold mortgage, deed of trust, deed to secure debt or other appropriate instrument (each being hereinafter referred to as a &quot;Leasehold Mortgage&quot;) in favor of a Lienholder. 14.02 LIENHOLDER DEFINED. As used in this Ground Lease, the term &quot;Lienholder&quot; shall mean the institutional lender, including, without limitation, a federal or state chartered bank, life insurance company, pension plan, REIT, savings and loan association, similar institution or any other individual or any entity, which is now or in the future the holder and owner of the debt secured by a Leasehold Mortgage. 14.03 CONSENT OF LIENHOLDER. EXCEPTING FOR UNCURED DEFAULTS OF LESSEE, THIS GROUND LEASE MAY NOT BE TERMINATED, SURRENDERED OR AMENDED NOR MAY ANY PROVISIONS HEREOF BE WAIVED OR DEFERRED BY THE LANDLORD OR THE TENANT, WITHOUT (i) THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ANY LIENHOLDER REQUESTING NOTICE; OR (ii) OTHERWISE COMPLYING WITH THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE XIV. 14.04 NOTICE TO LIENHOLDER. AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THIS GROUND LEASE, THE LANDLORD AGREES TO SEND TO ANY LIENHOLDER A COPY OF ALL NOTICES SENT BY THE LANDLORD TO THE TENANT OR RECEIVED BY THE LANDLORD FROM THE TENANT AFFECTING OR PERTAINING TO THE PREMISES. NO NOTICE FROM THE LANDLORD TO THE TENANT SHALL BE EFFECTIVE UNLESS AND UNTIL A COPY HAS BEEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE LIENHOLDER. HOWEVER, THE LANDLORD SHALL HAVE NO DUTY TO SEND A COPY OF ANY NOTICE TO OR TO SEEK ANY APPROVAL OF ANY LIENHOLDER WHO DOES NOT BY WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE LANDLORD REQUEST SUCH NOTICE AND SPECIFY THE ADDRESS TO WHICH COPIES OF SAME ARE TO BE SENT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 14.04.

In the event such default is not susceptible to being cured by the Lienholder without the Lienholder obtaining possession of the Premises or title to the Tenant's leasehold estate created hereby, a Lienholder commencing within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Tenant's cure period and thereafter, subject to unavoidable delays caused by bankruptcy or similar proceedings, pursuing to completion proceedings to obtain possession and/or to foreclose the Leasehold Mortgage held by the Lienholder, or diligently proceeding to obtain title to the Tenant's leasehold estate created hereby by deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing requirement that the Lienholder commence and carry to completion the curing of such default; provided that the Lienholder shall commence within thirty (30) days after obtaining such possession or such title the curing of such default and proceed diligently and in good faith to cure the default until completion. 14.06 RIGHTS TO CURE. A Lienholder shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any default under this Ground Lease, and the Landlord shall accept such performance by or at the instance of any Lienholder as if the same had been made by the Tenant. Provided, however, if a default under this Ground Lease places the interest of the Landlord at risk (i.e., such a default is an emergency, an environmental violation or other violation of law) the Landlord can proceed at any time after the expiration of Tenant's time to commence to cure such default if the Tenant has not cured or commenced to cure such default, to commence to cure such default at Tenant's expense. 14.07 NEW LEASE. If this Ground Lease shall terminate prior to the expiration of the Term for any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited to, operation of law or the rejection of this Ground Lease by any trustee of the Tenant in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement or similar proceeding, the Landlord shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lienholder and shall enter into a new lease (the &quot;New Lease&quot;) in recordable form with any Lienholder who demands such New Lease within sixty (60) days after the termination of the Ground Lease and who executes and delivers a New Lease to the Landlord and pays to the Landlord all sums due to the Landlord pursuant to the terms of Subsection 14.07(b) hereof. The New Lease shall have the same priority as this Ground Lease and shall contain the same terms and provisions as contained herein, including but not limited to the same provisions and rights in favor of and for the benefit of any Lienholder as are contained in this Ground Lease and the right to obtain an additional new lease in the event of the termination of said New Lease, and the right to receive notices of default, and to cure the same, in the same manner as provided in this Ground Lease. The following terms, provisions and covenant shall apply to the New Lease: A. the party executing the New Lease as the tenant thereunder shall have the right to assign or transfer the New Lease to any person or entity without the Landlord's consent so long as the New Lease is in good standing and current in obligations owed to the Landlord. Such right to obtain a New Lease shall only be available to a Lienholder who requests such New Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party who is assigning the New Lease and the estate created thereby shall provide to the Landlord notice of assignment and shall cause to be executed and delivered in a form reasonably acceptable to the Landlord an assumption agreement from the assignee pursuant to which said assignee assumes the duties, obligations, covenants, conditions and restrictions of the New Lease. Upon such assignment and assumption by the assignee, the assignor shall be released of all liability under the New Lease, and, upon request of the assignor, the Landlord shall execute and deliver to the assignor a release agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the assignor evidencing such release of the assignor from any liability under the New Lease; B. the New Lease shall be effective as of the date of termination of this Ground Lease (the &quot;New Lease Effective Date&quot;), and shall be effective for the remainder of the Term at the rent and upon all of the terms and provisions hereof. Upon the execution of a New Lease, the tenant thereunder shall pay to the Landlord, subject to the adjustments required below, any and all rent and all other sums payable to the Landlord by such tenant pursuant to the New Lease which accrued - 13 - during the period from the New Lease Effective Date to the date of execution and delivery of the New Lease (the &quot;New Lease Execution Date&quot;) plus any sums due hereunder by the Tenant prior to the New Lease Effective Date, less the net amount of all sums received by the Landlord from any subtenant in occupancy of any part or parts of the buildings or improvements built on the Property up to the New Lease Execution Date; C. subject to the terms of the second sentence of this Subsection 14.07(c), the party executing the New Lease as the tenant thereunder shall cure any non-monetary defaults under this Ground Lease within thirty (30) days after the later of: (i) taking possession of the Premises; and (ii) receipt of notice from the Landlord of all non-monetary defaults. In the event that any such non-monetary defaults cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days, such tenant shall commence to cure such non-monetary defaults within such thirty (30) day period and diligently and in good faith continue to cure such non-monetary defaults until completion; and D. following the termination of this Ground Lease and until any Lienholder has failed within sixty (60) days thereafter to demand a New Lease, the Landlord shall not alter or in any way demolish the improvements or any other improvements on the Premises.

The provisions of this Section 14.08 and Section 14.07 shall survive the termination, rejection or disaffirmance of this Ground Lease and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter to the same extent as if Sections 14.07 and 14.08 were a separate and independent contract made by the Landlord, the Tenant and the Lienholder. 14.09 SUBLEASES AND RENTS. After the termination of this Ground Lease and during the period thereafter during which any Lienholder shall be entitled to enter into a New Lease, the Landlord will not terminate any sublease or the rights of the subtenant under such a sublease unless such subtenant shall be in material default under such sublease. During such period the Landlord shall receive all base rent and other payments due from subtenants as agent of the Lienholder and shall deposit such rents and payments in a separate and segregated account in trust for the Premises and the Tenant, but may withdraw such sums, from time to time, to pay necessary operating expenses and carrying charges of the Premises, and, upon the execution and delivery of a New Lease, shall account to the tenant under the New Lease for the balance, if any, of the base rent, additional rents and other payment made under said subleases, and said tenant shall thereupon assign the base rent, additional rents and other payments due under said subleases to any Lienholder of the New Lease in the same manner as such rentals and other payments had been assigned to the Lienholder under this Ground Lease. Landlord may engage a reputable management firm of its choice to manage the Property and the reasonable expenses of such firm shall be a proper operating expense of the Property. 14.10 ASSIGNMENT.

The Landlord and the Tenant each agree to execute and deliver (and to execute a short form memorandum, if necessary, for recording purposes) any agreement reasonably necessary to effect any such amendment; provided, however, that any such amendment shall not in any way affect the Term or Rent or uses under this Ground Lease or otherwise, in any material respect, adversely affect any rights of the Landlord under this Ground Lease.

The Landlord and the Tenant shall indemnify and hold each other harmless against any and all claims, losses, liabilities and expenses which may be asserted against the other by any other broker, or person on the basis of any arrangements or agreements made or alleged to have been made by or on behalf of the indemnifying party in respect to this Ground Lease. 15.11 APPLICABLE LAW. This Ground Lease shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida and proper venue for any proceeding hereunder shall be Miami-Dade County. 15.12 LANDLORD'S LIEN AND SECURITY INTEREST. The Landlord subordinates its statutory landlord's lien rights with respect to the personal property, merchandise, inventory and trade fixtures of the Tenant brought onto the Premises and waives its statutory landlord's lien rights to the personal property, merchandise, inventory and trade fixtures of the tenants/subtenants of the Tenant brought onto the Premises. Further, the Landlord acknowledges this Ground Lease does not create a security interest for the use and benefit of the Landlord in and to the personal property, equipment, inventory or fixtures of the Tenant or tenant/subtenants of the Tenant. However, the Landlord does claim and possess a Security Interest as evidenced by financing statement(s) in the Tenant's subtenant leases which shall be subordinate and inferior to any Security Interest of any Lienholder. 15.13 CAPTIONS. The captions of this Ground Lease are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, limit or describe the scope or intent of this Ground Lease. 15.14 FACILITATION. Each party agrees to perform such further acts and to execute and deliver such further documents as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Ground Lease and are consistent therewith. 15.15 RADON GAS. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that, when it has accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities, may present health risks to persons who are - 16 - exposed to it over time. Levels of radon that exceed federal and state guidelines have been found in buildings in Florida. Additional information regarding radon and radon testing may be obtained from your county public health unit. 15.16 FORCE MAJEURE. In the event that either party to this Ground Lease shall be delayed or hindered in, or prevented from, the performance of any act required hereunder by reason of strikes, lock-outs, labor troubles, inability to procure materials, failure of power, restrictive governmental laws or regulations, riots, insurrection, war or other reason of a like nature which is not the fault of the party so delayed in performing acts required under the terms of the Ground Lease, then performance of such act shall be excused for the period of the delay, and the period for the performance of any such delayed act shall be extended for a period equivalent to the period of such delay. Provided, however, such force majeure shall not delay the payment of Net Minimum Rent by the Tenant to the Landlord for a cumulative period greater than ninety (90) days. 15.17 ACCORD AND SATISFACTION. No payment by the Tenant or receipt by the Landlord of a lesser amount than the Rent herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest stipulated Rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and the Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to the Landlord's right to recover the balance of such Rent or pursue any other remedies in this Ground Lease provided. 15.18 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL AND COUNTERCLAIMS. The Landlord and the Tenant each waive trial by jury in connection with proceedings or counterclaims brought by either of the parties against the other. In the event of suit by the Landlord to collect rent, the Tenant shall not interpose any counterclaim in such proceeding, provided, however, the Tenant may interpose a compulsory counterclaim in such suit. 15.19 HOLDING OVER. This Ground Lease shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the expiration of the Term, and any holding over by the Tenant after such expiration shall not constitute a renewal hereof or provide the Tenant with any rights hereunder except that the Tenant shall be deemed to be in possession of the Premises on a month-to-month tenancy commencing on the first day following the expiration of this Ground Lease and a tenant at sufferance of the Landlord. Any such tenancy shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein contained except that the monthly Rent shall be equal to one hundred fifty (150%) percent of the monthly Rent as of the date of expiration of the Term and said tenancy may be terminated at any time upon thirty (30) days' written notice by the Landlord to the Tenant or by the Tenant to the Landlord. If the Tenant fails to surrender the Premises upon expiration of this Ground Lease, despite demand to do so by the Landlord, the Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless the Landlord from any and all loss or liability as a result thereof. The acceptance of Rent under the provisions of this Section 15.19 shall not, however, be construed as a waiver by the Landlord of any rights of reentry as provided by law or as set forth in this Ground Lease, or any renewal hereof. The Tenant shall indemnify and save harmless the Landlord and its employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities or loss in connection with, wholly or in part, the Tenant's holding over. 15.20 CAPTIONS.

ARTICLE XVI LANDLORD'S RIGHT TO PERFORM TENANT'S COVENANTS 16.01 TENANT'S FAILURE TO PAY. If the Tenant shall at any time fail to pay any tax or assessment in accordance with the provisions of this Ground Lease, or to pay for or maintain any of the insurance policies provided for in this Ground Lease, or to make any other payment or perform any other act on its part to be made or performed under this Ground Lease, then after thirty (30) days' written notice to the Tenant (or, in case of any emergency on such notice, as may be reasonable under the circumstances) and without waiving or releasing the Tenant from any obligation of the Tenant hereunder, the Landlord may (but shall not be required to): A. pay any tax or assessment payable by the Tenant pursuant to the provisions of this Ground Lease; or B. pay for and maintain any of the insurance policies provided for in this Ground Lease; or C. make any other payment or perform any other act on the Tenant's part to be made or performed as in this Ground Lease provided; and D. enter upon the Premises for that purpose and take all such action thereon as may be necessary therefor. 16.02 REIMBURSEMENT OF THE LANDLORD. All sums paid by the Landlord and all costs and expenses incurred by the Landlord in connection with the performance of any such act (together with interest thereon at four (4%) percent per annum over and above the &quot;prime rate&quot; announced from time to time by THE WALL STREET JOURNAL as its &quot;prime rate&quot;, from the respective dates of the Landlord's making of each such payment or incurring of each such cost and expense) shall constitute Additional Rent payable by the Tenant on demand under this Ground Lease. ARTICLE XVII ENTRY ON PROPERTY BY LANDLORD Except in the case of an emergency, where only reasonable notice under the circumstances shall be required, the Tenant will permit the Landlord and its authorized representative(s) to enter the Premises, including any buildings built on the Property after reasonable, written notice, during normal business hours for the purpose of: (1) inspecting the buildings and Premises; and (2) making any necessary repairs thereto and performing any other work therein that may be necessary by reason of the Tenant's failure to make any such repairs or perform any such work or to commence the same within thirty (30) days after written notice from the Landlord. Nothing herein shall imply any duty or legal obligation on the part of the Landlord to do any such work, and the performance of such work by the Landlord shall not constitute a waiver of the Tenant's default in failing to perform the same. The Landlord may, during the progress of any such work, keep and store therein or elsewhere, all necessary materials, tools, supplies and equipment. The Landlord shall not be liable for inconvenience, annoyance, disturbance, loss of business or other damage of the Tenant or any subtenant by reason of making such repairs or the performance of any such work, or on account of - 18 - bringing materials, tools, supplies and equipment into or through the Premises during the course thereof and the obligation of the Tenant under this Ground Lease shall not be affected thereby. ARTICLE XVIII STATEMENTS At any time and from time to time, either party, on at least twenty (20) days' prior written request by the other party, will deliver to the party making such request a statement in writing certifying that this Ground Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there shall have been modifications that the same is in full force and effect as modified and stating the modifications) and the dates to which the rent and other charges have been paid and stating whether or not, to the best knowledge of the party executing such certificate, the party requesting such statement is in default in performance of any covenant, agreement or condition contained in this Ground Lease, and if so, specifying each such default of which the executing party may have knowledge. ARTICLE XIX RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL In the event the Landlord shall receive a BONA FIDE written offer from an independent, unrelated third party to purchase the Property or a portion thereof (hereinafter referred to as an &quot;Offer&quot;) during the term of this Ground Lease, and if the Landlord shall desire to accept the Offer, then, after accepting the Offer, which will contain a provision notifying said third party purchaser of the Tenant's right of first refusal hereunder, the Landlord shall deliver a photocopy of such Offer to the Tenant. The Tenant shall then have twenty (20) business days from the date of receipt of such offer within which to elect to purchase the Property or the portion thereof that is subject to the Offer upon the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Offer except that the closing date for the Tenant will be extended for a period equal to the number of days between the date the Landlord accepted said Offer and the date the Tenant actually received a copy of said Offer. The Tenant shall exercise the right granted to it hereunder by delivering written notice of its intent to purchase the Property or the portion thereof that is subject to the Offer, to the Landlord within the time period referred to above. In the event the Tenant shall elect to exercise the right granted to it hereunder, the closing of the transaction shall occur in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the Offer except as modified herein. In the event the Tenant shall not have exercised the right granted to it hereunder in the manner and within the time period provided for herein, the Landlord shall then be free to accept the Offer and to sell the Property or the portion thereof that is subject to the Offer, pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the Offer and the Tenant shall have no interest in or rights with respect to the Property or the portion thereof that is subject to the Offer. The Landlord, in its sole and absolute discretion, may at any time reject an Offer made to it, and any such rejection shall fully and completely terminate the Tenant's rights hereunder with respect to each such rejected Offer. If the Landlord accepts an Offer after the Tenant has elected not to accept such Offer, and the transaction contemplated by such Offer fails to close for any reason whatsoever, the Tenant's rights hereunder to notice of subsequent Offers and to elect to purchase the Property or a portion thereof shall remain in full force and effect.
