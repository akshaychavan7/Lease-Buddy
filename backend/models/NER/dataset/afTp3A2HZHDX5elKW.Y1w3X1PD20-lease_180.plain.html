Additional Rent: Together with the obligation to pay Basic Annual Rent, the Tenant is also obligated to pay Additional Rent during the term of the Lease. The failure to timely pay Additional Rent is a failure to timely pay rent under the provisions of all statutes and laws. i. Monthly Installment of Additional Rent: The Tenant is obligated to pay a Monthly Installment of Additional Rent on the Commencement Date and on the first day of every calendar month during the term of this Lease. The Monthly Installment of Additional Rent which the Tenant is obligated to pay is the Tenant's Proportionate Share.

(2) Adjusted Amount: The Landlord shall periodically review its estimate of the Common Expenses. If the Landlord determines that its estimate requires adjustment, the Landlord shall send Notice thereof to the Tenant, and from and after the mailing or delivery of such Notice to the Tenant, the Tenant is obligated to pay each Monthly Installment of Additional Rent in the amount set forth in the Notice from the Landlord. The Landlord has the right to adjust (by increase or decrease) the amount of the Monthly Installment of Additional Rent as often as the Landlord reasonably determines is necessary, and the Tenant is required to pay each Monthly Installment of Additional Rent in the amount set forth in the then most recent Notice from the Landlord stating the amount of the Monthly Installment of Additional Rent. (3) Reconciliation: During the term of this Lease each year the Landlord shall furnish the Tenant a statement which sets forth in reasonable detail the actual Common Expenses for the prior calendar year. (a) Greater than actual: If the Tenant paid greater than the Tenant's Proportionate Share of the actual Common Expenses in the prior calendar year, the difference shall be refunded by Landlord, or applied by Landlord to amounts than due, or to become due, from the Tenant, at the option of the Landlord. (b) Less than actual: If the tenant paid less than the Tenant's Proportionate Share of the actual Common Expenses in the prior calendar year, then the difference between what the Tenant paid and Tenant's Proportionate Share of the actual Common Expenses shall be due and payable to the Landlord as Additional Rent and shall be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord within 5 business days of demand. ii. Other Amounts Due under Lease: All amounts except Basic Annual Rent to be paid by Tenant under the Provisions Of This Lease are Additional Rent, and shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within 5 business days of demand thereof. iii. Payments by Landlord: If Landlord pays any money which is the obligation of the Tenant according to the Provisions Of This Lease, or if the Landlord incurs any expense, including reasonable attorney's fees, in the enforcement of the Landlord's rights under this Lease or the performance of any obligations otherwise imposed upon the Tenant under the Provisions Of This Lease, then such money paid and such expense incurred is Additional Rent and shall be paid to Landlord by Tenant within 5 business days of demand . iv. Tenant's Excessive Use: If in the reasonable judgment of the Landlord the Tenant's use of electricity, production of trash or garbage, or other acts or omissions on the part of Tenant cause a disproportionate increase in the Common Expenses, it is the responsibility of the Tenant to pay the entire amount attributed to such increase in the Common Expenses as Additional Rent, and Tenant shall pay same to Landlord upon each demand within 5 business days of the demand. 3. Security Deposit: The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord without interest thereon owing to Tenant, in a separate account or in any general property management account established by Landlord and may be commingled with other funds of the Landlord and other third parties. Each time the amount of the Security Deposit is diminished by Landlord's use, retention or application thereof, Tenant shall, within 3 days after Landlord's demand, deposit additional money with Landlord sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. The obligations to make deposits to restore the Security Deposit are obligations to make payments of Additional Rent. Landlord may use, apply or retain the Security Deposit to the extent required for the payment of any sum as to which Tenant is in default or for any sum which Landlord may expend by reason of Tenant's default on any of the Provisions Of This Lease. If Tenant shall comply with all of the Provisions Of This Lease, the Security Deposit shall be returned to Tenant after the end term of this Lease and after the delivery of possession of the Leased Premises to Landlord. Landlord has the right to transfer the Security Deposit to any successor to Landlord's interest in the Lease, and upon such transfer Landlord is hereby released by Tenant from all liability for the return of such Security Deposit. The Landlord's rights to recovery against the Tenant is not limited to the amount of the Security Deposit. 4. Notices: All Notices shall be sent to Landlord at the Landlord's address as set forth in the Specific Lease Provisions, or to such other address as the Landlord shall inform the Tenant in writing.

Notwithstanding any other statements in this Lease to the contrary, in no event shall the Tenant use the Leased Premises, or suffer or permit the use of the Leased Premises, in any manner such that the Leased Premises will be or become a place of public accommodation under the terms of Title III of the ADA, 42 USC ss.1281, et. seq., or the rules and regulations issued thereunder.

The Landlord may elect to maintain the air conditioning systems in the Leased Premises, and if it so elects, the cost of all such maintenance (including replacement if necessary) shall be part of the Common Expenses. If the Landlord does not elect to maintain the air conditioning systems, the maintenance thereof shall be the responsibility of the Tenant and the Tenant shall bear all expenses related thereto. Landlord shall not be required to commence any repair until a reasonable item after written Notice from the Tenant that such repair is necessary, and thereafter shall have a reasonable time to complete such repair, which shall in no event be less than the time period provided by Florida Statutes 83.201.

Tenant shall also promptly pay all charges for maintaining any such service, including any charges for repairing mechanical systems and for installing, repairing and setting meters. 12. Failure to Deliver Possession: Tenant recognizes that factors beyond the reasonable control of Landlord may prevent Landlord from delivering the Leased Premises to the Tenant on the Commencement Date, and Tenant is willing to accept that risk. In the event that the Landlord fails to deliver possession of the Leased Premises to the Tenant on the Commencement Date the Landlord shall have no liability whatsoever to Tenant for such failure or any direct or consequential damages arising therefrom, and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, however, there shall be no Basic Annual Rent or Additional Rent due hereunder until the Landlord is able to deliver possession to the Tenant. In the vent of a delay in delivery of possession to the Tenant, the Commencement Date shall be the date upon which possession is actually delivered to the Tenant, and such date shall be confirmed as otherwise set forth in this Lease. 13. Environmental Matters: a. No Environmental Violations: Tenant shall not at any time (i) cause, permit or suffer to occur any Environmental Violation in, on, under or above the Property or (ii) permit any person or entity occupying or using the Property or any part thereof under or through Tenant to cause, permit or suffer to occur any Environmental Violation. Tenant is responsible for cleaning up and remedying any Environmental Violation on the Leased Premises. b. Tenant's Obligations/Financial Assurances: If an Environmental Violation occurs or is found to exist, the Tenant is responsible for remedying the Environmental Violation and its clean up, including but not limited to all costs and expenses incident or related thereto. If in Landlord's reasonable judgment, the cost of remediation and clean up is likely to exceed $5,000.00 Tenant shall provide to Landlord, within ten (10) days after Landlord's request therefor, adequate financial assurances that Tenant will effect such remediation in accordance with the applicable Environmental Laws. Such financial assurances shall be a bond or letter of credit reasonable satisfactory to Landlord in form and substance and in an amount equal to or greater than Landlord's reasonable estimate of the anticipated cost of remedy and clean up. c. Compliance with All Laws: The Tenant is responsible for compliance with all Environmental Laws and is responsible for remedying any Environmental Violation and clean up. If Tenant fails to comply with all Environmental Laws or fails to remedy any Environmental Violation or fails to clean up, then Landlord shall have the right (but no obligation) to take any and all actions as Landlord shall deem necessary or advisable in order to cure such Environmental Violation and comply with all Environmental Laws, and all expenses and costs incurred by Landlord in so doing shall be Additional Rent. d. Notice to Landlord: Tenant shall notify Landlord immediately after becoming aware of any Environmental Violation (or alleged Environmental Violation) or noncompliance with any of the covenants contained in this part of the Lease entitled &quot;Environmental Matters&quot;. e. Survival: The obligations of Tenant under this part of the Lease entitled &quot;Environmental Matters&quot; shall survive the end of the term of this Lease. 14. Assignment/Subletting: This Lease may not be assigned by Tenant, and no part of the Leased Premises may be subleased by Tenant, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Landlord may condition the grant of such consent upon the Tenant's payment of all attorney's fees and costs incurred by the Landlord thereby, upon delivery of such information as the Landlord reasonably requests in relation thereto, and upon receipt of a guarantee and indemnification acceptable to Landlord. If there is an assignment or subleasing without the express written consent of Landlord, Landlord may collect Basic Annual Rent and Additional Rent from the assignee, subtenant or occupant and apply the net amount collected to the amounts due under this Lease; but such collection shall not be deemed a waiver of Landlord's right to forbid the assignment or sublease and it shall not be deemed to be the acceptance by Landlord of the assignee, subtenant or occupant as a Tenant hereunder, or as a release of performance of the obligations of Tenant. Each time that the Tenant submits a request for the consent of the Landlord to permit the Tenant to assign or sublease, the Landlord has the option during the 90 day period following such request to end the term of this Lease as of a date stated by Landlord, and Landlord has no liability to the Tenant if the Landlord enters into a lease or other agreement with the proposed subtenant or assignee prior to, upon, or after such declaration by the Landlord. 15.
