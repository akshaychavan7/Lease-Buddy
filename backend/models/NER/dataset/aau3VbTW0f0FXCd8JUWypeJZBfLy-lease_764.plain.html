          <p id="s1p33">3. (a) The Bank shall not, directly or indirectly, extend or renew any credit to or for the benefit of any borrower, including any related interest of the borrower, who is obligated to the Bank in any manner on any extension of credit or portion thereof that has been charged off by the Bank or classified, in whole or in part, “loss” in the Report of Examination or in any subsequent report of examination, as long as such credit remains uncollected.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">(b) The Bank shall not, directly or indirectly, extend or renew any credit to or for the benefit of any borrower, including any related interest of the borrower, whose extension of credit has been classified “doubtful” or “substandard” in the Report of Examination or in any subsequent report of examination, without the prior approval of the board of directors. The board of directors shall document in writing the reasons for the extension of credit or renewal, specifically certifying that: (i) the extension of credit is necessary to protect the Bank’s interest in the ultimate collection of the credit already granted or (ii) the extension of credit is in full compliance with the Bank’s written loan policy, is adequately secured, and a thorough credit analysis has been performed indicating that the extension or renewal is reasonable and justified, all necessary loan documentation has been properly and accurately prepared and filed, the extension of credit will not impair the Bank’s interest in obtaining repayment of the already outstanding credit, and the board of directors reasonably believes that the extension of credit or renewal will be repaid according to its terms. The written certification shall be made a part of the minutes of the board of directors meetings, and a copy of the signed certification, together with the credit analysis and related information that was used in the determination, shall be retained by the Bank in the borrower’s credit file for subsequent supervisory review. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “related interest” is defined as set forth in section 215.2(n) of Regulation O of the Board of Governors (12 C.F.R. § 215.2(n)).</p>
