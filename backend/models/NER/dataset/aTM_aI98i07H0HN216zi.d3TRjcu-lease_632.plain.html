We have also assumed, without verification, the accuracy as to factual matters of the representations and warranties of the parties in each Transaction Document and that the parties have complied and will comply with the provisions of the Transaction Documents relevant to the opinions expressed herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p50">With respect to the matters set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of the preceding paragraph as they apply to each of the Companies (except as stated herein with respect to the Companies), we have relied, with your consent and without independent investigation, on the opinion of Susan J. Thomas, Secretary of each of the Companies and Associate General Counsel, Global Structured Finance, of Ford Credit (the “In-House Opinion”), addressed to you and dated the date hereof. With respect to the matters set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of the preceding paragraph as they apply to the Issuer, we have relied, with your consent and without independent investigation, on the opinions of Richards, Layton &amp; Finger P.A., Delaware counsel to the Issuer and the Owner Trustee (the “RLF Opinions”), each addressed to you and dated the date hereof. To the extent that the opinions set forth herein rely upon the In-House Opinion or the RLF Opinions, the opinions set forth herein are subject to any limitations, qualifications, assumptions and exceptions specified in such opinions.</p>
          <p id="s1p51">Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:</p>
          <p id="s1p52">1. Each of the Basic Documents to which Ford Credit is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of Ford Credit, enforceable against Ford Credit in accordance with its terms.</p>
          <p id="s1p53">2. Each of the Basic Documents to which any Titling Company is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of such Titling Company, enforceable against such Titling Company in accordance with its terms.</p>
          <p id="s1p54">5</p>
          <p id="s1p55">3. Each of the Basic Documents to which any Holding Company is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of such Holding Company, enforceable against such Holding Company in accordance with its terms.</p>
          <p id="s1p56">4. Each of the Basic Documents (other than the Trust Agreement) to which the Depositor is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Depositor, enforceable against the Depositor in accordance with its terms.</p>
          <p id="s1p57">5. Each of the Basic Documents to which the Issuer is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Issuer, enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms.</p>
          <p id="s1p58">6. The 2012-A Exchange Note has been duly authorized by the related Titling Companies and, when duly executed and delivered by such Titling Companies, authenticated by the Administrative Agent and delivered against payment therefor, will constitute the legal, valid and binding joint and several obligation of the related Titling Companies, enforceable against such Titling Companies in accordance with its terms, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Credit and Security Agreement and the Exchange Note Supplement.</p>
          <p id="s1p59">7. The Notes have been duly authorized by the Issuer and, when duly executed and delivered by the Issuer, authenticated by the Indenture Trustee and delivered against payment therefor, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer, enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.</p>
          <p id="s1p60">8. Upon the issuance and delivery thereof by the applicable Titling Company in accordance with the related Titling Company Agreement and the terms of the Transaction Notices, each Collateral Specified Interest Certificate was duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the applicable Titling Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Titling Company, enforceable against such Titling Company in accordance with its terms, and will be entitled to the benefits of the related Titling Company Agreement.</p>
          <p id="s1p61">9. The execution and delivery by each of the Companies and the Issuer of the Transaction Documents and the Transaction Notices to which it is a party, and the compliance by each of the Companies and the Issuer with the terms and provisions of such agreements, including the issuance of the 2012-A Exchange Note and the Notes, will not contravene any provision of any Applicable Law of the State of New York, the State of Delaware or the United States of America.</p>
          <p id="s1p62">10. No Governmental Approval (other than the filing of UCC financing statements with respect to (a) the sale or transfer of the 2012-A Exchange Note by Ford Credit to the Depositor pursuant to the First-Tier Sale Agreement, (b) the sale or transfer of the 2012-A Exchange Note by the Depositor to the Issuer pursuant to the Second-Tier Sale Agreement and (c) the grant of a security interest in the 2012-A Exchange Note by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture), which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect, is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, the execution or delivery of the</p>

          <p id="s1p64">Transaction Documents to which it is a party and each of the Transaction Notices that it has delivered by each of the Companies or the Issuer, or the enforceability of any of the Transaction Documents (other than the Trust Agreement) to which it is a party against each of the Companies or the Issuer, as applicable.</p>
          <p id="s1p65">11. The Registration Statement and any amendments thereto are effective under the Securities Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and not withdrawn, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened and not terminated.</p>
          <p id="s1p66">12. The offer, sale and delivery of the 2012-A Exchange Note by the Titling Companies to Ford Credit in the manner contemplated in the Credit and Security Agreement does not require registration under the Securities Act.</p>
          <p id="s1p67">13. The offer, sale and delivery of the Class A-1 Notes and the Class B Notes by the Depositor to the Class A-1 Note Purchasers and the Class B Note Purchasers, respectively, in the manner contemplated in the Class A-1 Note Purchase Agreement and the Class B Note Purchase Agreement, respectively, does not require registration under the Securities Act; provided, that we express no opinions as to any subsequent resale of the Class A-1 Notes or the Class B Notes.</p>
          <p id="s1p68">14. None of the Titling Companies, the Holding Companies, the Depositor or the Issuer is required to be registered as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).</p>
          <p id="s1p69">15. The Class A-1 Notes, when duly executed, authenticated and delivered against payment by the Class A-1 Purchasers, will constitute “Eligible Securities” as such term is defined in Rule 2a-7(a)(12) under the Investment Company Act, so long as the Class A-1 Notes have a rating from the Requisite NRSROs (as defined in Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act) in one of the two highest short-term rating categories.</p>
          <p id="s1p70">16. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and neither the Credit and Security Agreement nor the Trust Agreement is required to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.</p>
          <p id="s1p71">17. The 2012-A Exchange Note, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes, the Class A-4 Notes, the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the other Basic Documents conform in all material respects with their descriptions in the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Final Prospectus Supplement. The Class A-1 Notes and the Class A-1 Note Purchase Agreement conform in all material respects with their descriptions in the Preliminary Class A-1 Offering Memorandum and the Final Class A-1 Offering Memorandum. The Class B Notes and the Class B Note Purchase Agreement conform in all material respects with their descriptions in the Preliminary Class B Offering Memorandum and the Final Class B Offering Memorandum.</p>
          <p id="s1p72">7</p>
          <p id="s1p73">18. The statements contained in the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the Final Prospectus Supplement, the Preliminary Class A-1 Offering Memorandum, the Final Class A-1 Offering Memorandum, the Preliminary Class B Offering Memorandum and the Final Class B Offering Memorandum, under the heading “ERISA Considerations”, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of law and legal conclusions, and subject to the qualifications therein, have been prepared or reviewed by us and are correct in all material respects.</p>
          <p id="s1p74">The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:</p>
          <p id="s1p75">(a) The enforceability of the Basic Documents may be limited to the extent that any section thereof relates to the submission to the subject matter jurisdiction of, or the waiver of venue or inconvenient forum objections as they relate to, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or the New York State courts.</p>
          <p id="s1p76">(b) The enforceability of the Basic Documents referred to in paragraphs 1 through 5 above may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general equity principles.</p>
          <p id="s1p77">(c) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision purporting to provide indemnification or contribution relating to matters under federal or state securities laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p78">(d) Exculpatory provisions, waivers and provisions regarding arbitration of disputes may be limited on public policy grounds.</p>
          <p id="s1p79">(e) We express no opinion as to any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification which may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p80">(f) We express no opinion herein as to the creation, attachment, perfection or priority of any security interests which are purported to be created under the Indenture.</p>
          <p id="s1p81">(g) We express no opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on the Transaction Documents or any transactions contemplated thereby.</p>
          <p id="s1p82">(h) In rendering the opinions in paragraph 13, we have assumed (1) the accuracy of the representations and warranties (other than as to legal conclusions) and compliance with the covenants by (A) the parties to the Class A-1 Note Purchase Agreement and the Class B Note Purchase Agreement and (B) the investors in the Class A-1 Notes and the Class B Notes which are deemed to be made by such investors as described in the Class A-1 Offering Memorandum and the Class B Offering Memorandum, respectively, (2) that investors to whom the Class A-1 Note Purchasers initially place the Class A-1 Notes receive a copy of the Class A-1</p>
          <p id="s1p83">8</p>
          <p id="s1p84">Offering Memorandum and (3) that investors to whom the Class B Note Purchasers initially place the Class B Notes receive a copy of the Class B Offering Memorandum.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">(i) To the extent any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of the Transaction Documents, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon New York General Obligation Law §§ 5-1401, 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction, other than the courts of the State of New York, in which enforcement of such provisions, or of a judgment upon an agreement containing such provisions, is sought.</p>
          <p id="s1p86">(j) We call to your attention that the choice of New York law on the basis of Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligation Law is only relevant insofar as litigation is brought to enforce the Transaction Documents in the courts of the State of New York, and we have assumed that there is basis for jurisdiction in such courts.</p>
          <p id="s1p87">(k) We express no opinion on the enforceability of any provision in a Transaction Document purporting to prohibit, restrict or condition the assignment of rights under such Transaction Document to the extent such restriction on assignability is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
          <p id="s1p88">(l) We note that Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act imposes restrictions on investment by money market funds in Eligible Securities, including that the fund’s board of directors determine that the investment present minimal credit risks and that certain portfolio diversification and maturity limitations be satisfied and our opinion in paragraph 15 does not address any issues beyond satisfaction of the definition of Eligible Securities.</p>
          <p id="s1p89">We are members of the bar of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion as to any laws other than the Applicable Laws of the State of New York and the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States of America.</p>
