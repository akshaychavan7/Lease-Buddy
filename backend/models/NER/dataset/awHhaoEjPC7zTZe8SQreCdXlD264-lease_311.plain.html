          <p id="s1p9">Tenant shall also have the nonexclusive right to use, on a non-reserved basis (subject to this Section below), during the Lease Term and any extension thereof the parking spaces within Phase 1 (defined below) (without imposition of a parking fee for the use of the parking spaces) at a ratio for each Building equal to three and eighty six one-hundredths (3.86) spaces per one thousand (1,000) Deemed Building Square Footage (rounded down to the nearest whole space), together with the Amenities Building and the other areas within the Project (defined below) designated by Landlord as common area for the use of the Building from time to time (“Common Area”) including but not limited to landscaping, sidewalks, service areas and other common facilities designated by Landlord for the use of the Buildings.

During any period when Tenant does not lease all of the rentable space in the buildings located within Phase 2 from time to time,</p>

Tenant shall have the right to mark fifteen (15) non-handicapped parking spaces near each Building, in a location reasonably acceptable to Landlord, for Tenant’s visitors (which spaces shall be a portion of Tenant’s parking allocation set forth above). During any period when Landlord is under contract with any Amenities Building vendor, Landlord shall have the right to reserve not more than ten (10) parking spaces within Phase 1 for itself, its contractors, Amenities Building vendors and others designated by Landlord from time to time; but during any period when Landlord is not under contract with any Amenities Building Vendor and Tenant is operating the Amenities Building as described below, use of the parking area by Landlord and its contractors and other designated users shall be on a non-reserved as needed basis. As used in this Lease, “Phase 1” shall mean the Buildings, Amenities Building, the approximately eight and eight-tenths (8.8) acre parcel of land upon which the Buildings and Amenities Building are located (the “Land”), the parking structure located upon the Land (the “Parking Structure”) and the other improvements now located or hereafter constructed on the Land from time to time. As used in this Lease, “Project” shall mean Phase 1, subject to expansion of the Project as provided below. Unless expressly provided otherwise in this Lease, the term Premises as used in this Lease shall include the Tenant Improvements (defined in Section 6.B below).</p>

          <p id="s1p13">So long as Tenant leases all of the rentable space in the Buildings, the Amenities Building café and gym shall each be operated by a vendor selected by Tenant and approved by Landlord (each being a “Tenant’s Vendor” and collectively the “Tenant’s Vendors”), Landlord’s approval not to be unreasonably withheld, and shall be available for use solely by Tenant, its subtenants and their respective employees. Each Tenant’s Vendor shall provide its services pursuant to a written contract entered into directly between Tenant and such vendor (each a “Vendor Contract” and collectively the “Vendor Contracts”). The term of each Vendor Contract shall not extend beyond the Lease Term, and shall contain an early termination right pursuant to which such contract shall be terminable on not less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) days notice from either Tenant or Landlord, which right shall not be subject to change without Landlord’s approval, which approval may be withheld in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion. All other terms and conditions of the Vendor Contracts shall be subject to Landlord’s approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.</p>
          <p id="s1p14">If Tenant ceases to lease all of the rentable space in the Buildings, each Party shall have the right to terminate either or both of the Vendor Contracts by delivering not less than sixty (60) nor more than ninety (90) days written notice of termination to the applicable vendor and to the other Party. Until such time as a Vendor Contract is terminated, Tenant shall continue to operate the facility subject to such contract, and if Tenant no longer leases all of the rentable space in the Buildings all other tenants and their subtenants of Phase 1, and their respective employees, shall have equal access to such facility on a non-discriminatory basis, without charge by Tenant or the applicable vendor except for any charge imposed by the café vendor for the consumption of food and beverage items on a non-discriminatory basis. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, if Tenant no longer leases all of the rentable space in the Buildings and other tenants in Phase 1 are using the Amenities Building, then a prorata portion (based on relative rentable square feet of space leased) of the monthly charge owed to a Tenant’s Vendor under its Vendor Contract shall be paid by Landlord to Tenant each month while such Vendor Contract remains in effect, prorated for partial months, not later than thirty (30) days after written demand for such payment and evidence of the amount owed is delivered to Landlord. If a Vendor Contract is terminated and Tenant no longer leases all of the rentable space in the Buildings, Landlord shall exert commercially reasonable efforts to hire a substitute vendor on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Landlord (which may be, but is not required to be, the Tenant’s Vendor) to operate the applicable facility, the</p>

          <p id="s1p16">cost of which shall be included in Reimbursable Operating Costs (defined in Section 9.D). Landlord shall have no obligation or right to hire a vendor for the Amenities Building café or fitness facility during any period when Tenant leases all of the rentable space in the Buildings or a Vendor Contract remains in effect for such facility. If at any time during the Lease Term Tenant does not lease all of the rentable space in the Buildings, then Landlord shall have the right to allow other Phase 1 tenants and subtenants, and their respective employees, to use the Amenities Building, in which event the Building’s Allocable Share of the deemed square footage of the Amenities Building shall be equitably adjusted by Landlord to take into account the deemed square footage of the premises leased by such other Phase 1 tenants (as reasonably determined by Landlord), and the deemed rentable square footage of the Premises shall be adjusted accordingly to reflect the adjustment to each Building’s Allocable Share of the Amenities Building deemed square footage. During any period when Tenant does not lease all of the rentable area in the Buildings, use of the Amenities Building shall be subject to such rules and regulations and hours of operation designated by Landlord from time to time. Regardless of who hires the vendor for the fitness center, prior to Tenant or its subtenants or their respective employees using the fitness center, Tenant shall cause such person desiring to use the fitness center to sign an informed consent waiver and release of liability in a form prepared by Landlord. Landlord shall be entitled to prohibit anyone from using the fitness center if such person fails or refuses to execute such informed consent waiver and release of liability. Landlord shall have no obligation whatsoever to enact or enforce rules and regulations governing the cafe and fitness center or make reservations thereof, and Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord with respect to same. Landlord’s costs of owning, operating, maintaining, cleaning, repairing and restoring the Amenities Building (other than the initial cost incurred by Landlord to build the Amenities Building and install permanent fixtures therein and to install exercise equipment in the Gym) shall be included as part of Reimbursable Operating Costs. Subject to the waivers set forth in Section 10.D below, Tenant shall be responsible for all damage to the Amenities Building and its fixtures, equipment and furnishings resulting from Tenant, its subtenants or their respective employees’ use of the Amenities Building, ordinary wear and tear excepted. The Amenities Building is part of the Common Area. There shall be no charge to Tenant, its subtenants or their respective employees for the use of the fitness center (other than the inclusion of costs incurred by Landlord with respect to the fitness center and the rest of the Amenities Building as part of Reimbursable Operating Costs and inclusion of the deemed rentable square footage of the Amenities Building as part of the deemed rentable square footage assigned to the Building), but during any period when Landlord is under contract with the café vendor for the Amenities Building use of the cafe will be subject to charges imposed by the cafe operator from time to time. During any period when Landlord contracts with a vendor for operation of the café or fitness center, Landlord shall consult with Tenant regarding the cafe menu or fitness center classes, as applicable, but the final decision on such matters shall be within Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion. All loose furniture in the café or outdoor courtyard (that is, furniture that is not permanently affixed to the Building) shall be provided by Tenant at Tenant’s sole cost throughout the Lease Term; provided however that if at any time during the Lease Term Tenant leases less than all of the rentable space in the Buildings, Tenant shall have the right to remove its loose furniture from the café or outdoor courtyard provided Tenant gives Landlord not less than thirty (30) days prior notice of its intent to remove such furniture, so that Landlord can make arrangements to provide other furniture for such areas.</p>
          <p id="s1p17">Landlord shall have the right, in its reasonable discretion, from time to time, to do the following, provided that the same do not unreasonably interfere with Tenant’s use of the Premises or the Amenities Building or materially increase the obligations or materially decrease the rights of Tenant under this Lease (except however that costs with respect to same shall be governed by other applicable provisions of this Lease) and provided that the Amenities Building is not eliminated as a Project amenity: (a) [Intentionally deleted]; (b) close temporarily any of the Common Area for maintenance and repair purposes or to prevent a public dedication thereof; (c) [Intentionally deleted]; (d) use the Common Area while engaged in making additional improvements, repairs or alterations to the Buildings or the Project allowed or required by this Lease; (e) erect, use, and maintain pipes, wires and conduits in and through the Premises; and (f) do and perform any other acts, alter or expand or make any other changes in, to or with respect to the Common Area and the Project</p>

          <p id="s1p19">(other than the Buildings, except as required for Landlord to perform its obligations under this Lease or to comply with Laws) as Landlord may, in its reasonable discretion, deem to be appropriate. Landlord reserves the absolute right to effect such other tenancies in the other Project buildings (if any) as Landlord in the exercise of its sole business judgment shall determine to best promote the interests of Landlord, subject to Sections 19.E, 19.F and 19.G below. Tenant has not relied on the fact, nor has Landlord represented, that any specific tenant or type or number of tenants shall occupy any space in the other Project buildings, or that any specific tenant or type of tenant shall be excluded from occupying any space in the other Project buildings.</p>
          <p id="s1p20">Landlord and Tenant have agreed to use the square footage numbers set forth in this Lease as the basis of calculating the rent due under this Lease and Tenant’s Allocable Share (defined in Section 9.E below), and the rent due under this Lease and Tenant’s Allocable Share shall not be subject to revision if the actual square footages are more or less than as stated in this Lease, except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Lease (for example, in the event of a partial taking of the Project as described in Section 17 below, or in the event a Phase 2 building tenant is granted the right to use the Amenities Building as described in this Section above)). No representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, is given to Tenant with respect to the square footage of the Premises, Buildings, Amenities Building or any other portion of the Project or the square footage or acreage of the Land or Phase 2 Land (defined below). Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant if the square footages and acreage described in this Lease differ from the actual square footages or acreage.</p>
          <p id="s1p21">Landlord currently owns certain real property across Lawson Lane comprised of approximately seven and fifty five one-hundredths (7.55) acres (the “Phase 2 Land”), which is currently entitled for the development of two (2) office buildings and related improvements. However, subject to Tenant’s rights under Sections 19.E, 19.F and 19.G below, (i) there is no assurance that Landlord will develop the Phase 2 Land, or that if develops the Phase 2 Land it will be developed as currently entitled, and (ii) in no event shall Landlord have any liability to Tenant if all or any portion of the Phase 2 Land is not developed or is developed in a manner differently than as currently entitled. If, however, Landlord does develop all or any portion of the Phase 2 Land, the Phase 2 Land and improvements thereon may be incorporated into the Project by Landlord, determined in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion, and shall thereafter constitute “Phase 2” of, and be part of, the Project, subject to Tenant’s rights under Sections 19.E, 19.F and 19.G below.</p>
          <p id="s1p22">During any construction on the Phase 2 Land, Tenant shall abide by, and cause its agents, employees, contractors, invitees, licensees, guests and customers to abide by, all safety and construction rules and regulations of Landlord or its general contractor. Tenant acknowledges that during the course of construction upon the Phase 2 Land, loud noises and/or dust may be emitted from the site of such construction. Notwithstanding that Tenant’s normal business operations may be disturbed or interfered with during the period of construction due to loud noises, dust or other construction-related activities, Tenant’s Base Monthly Rent and other amounts due under this Lease shall not be abated as a result of such construction and, during the period of construction on the Land or Phase 2 Land, Tenant shall continue to timely perform all of its obligations under the Lease then accruing. The preceding notwithstanding, Landlord shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to minimize, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, any material interference that the construction on the Land or Phase 2 Land may have on Tenant’s business operations in the Premises and the emission of dust while construction work is being performed and in no event shall such construction prevent 24/7 access to the Premises. Such commercially reasonable efforts, as such term is used in the immediately preceding sentence, shall not require Landlord to undertake construction on weekends or evenings or require Landlord to install any soundproofing in the Building or Amenities Building or institute dust control measures beyond those required by the City. Tenant hereby waives any right to terminate this Lease due to any such construction activities undertaken in accordance with the terms of this Lease with respect to construction on the Land or Phase 2 Land.</p>

Base Monthly Rent shall be due in advance on or before the first day of each calendar month during the Lease Term, except that if the Commencement Date is not the first (1st) day of the calendar month, Base Monthly Rent for the first (1) partial month of the Lease term shall be due on the Commencement Date, and the six (6) months of free rent shown in the rent schedule above shall apply only to the first (1st) six (6) full calendar months of the Lease Term. Notwithstanding that Base Monthly Rent for the first (1st) six (6) full calendar months of the Lease Term is Zero Dollars ($0.00), Reimbursable Operating Costs and all other sums due under this Lease, other than Base Monthly Rent (but otherwise including without limitation management fees pursuant to Section 20.N, based on an assumed Base Monthly Rent amount of Nine Hundred Seventy Thousand One Hundred Fifty Seven Dollars and Sixty Five Cents ($970,157.65)), shall be due for such six (6) full calendar month period. All sums payable by Tenant under this Lease shall be paid to Landlord in lawful money of the United States of America, without offset or deduction and except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease without prior notice or demand, at the address specified in Section 1 of this Lease or at such place or places as may be designated in writing by Landlord during the Lease Term. Base Monthly Rent for any period less than a calendar month (including the first partial calendar month of the Lease Term if the Commencement Date is not on the first day of a calendar month) shall be a pro rata portion of the monthly installment based on the number of days in the partial calendar month; provided that if this Lease terminates due to Tenant’s default, Tenant shall not be relieved of the obligation to pay future accruing rent, and the provisions of Section 14 shall control. Concurrently with Tenant’s execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum of Nine Hundred Seventy Thousand One Hundred Fifty Seven Dollars and Sixty Five Cents ($970,157.65) as a deposit to be applied on the Commencement Date against the Base Monthly Rent due for the seventh (7th) full calendar month of the Lease Term.</p>

          <p id="s1p94">Late Charge:</p>
          <p id="s1p95">Tenant hereby acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Base Monthly Rent and other sums due hereunder will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which is extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include but are not limited to: administrative, processing, accounting, and late charges which may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any contract, revolving credit, mortgage, or trust deed covering the Premises. Accordingly, if any installment of Base Monthly Rent or other sum due from Tenant is not received by Landlord or Landlord’s designee within five (5) days after it is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a late charge equal to five (5%) percent of such overdue amount, which late charge shall be due and payable on the same date that the overdue amount was due. The parties agree that such late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late payment by Tenant, excluding interest and attorneys fees and costs. If any Base Monthly Rent or other sum due from Tenant remains delinquent for a period in excess of thirty (30) days then, in addition to such late charge, Tenant shall pay to Landlord interest on any rent that is not paid when due at the Agreed Interest Rate (defined in</p>
          <p id="s1p96">-10-</p>
          <p id="s1p97">Section 14.B) from the date such amount became due until paid. Acceptance by Landlord of such late charge or interest shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default with respect to such overdue amount nor prevent Landlord from exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder. In the event that a late charge is payable hereunder, whether or not collected, for three (3) consecutive installments of Base Monthly Rent, then the Base Monthly Rent, property management fees and Reimbursable Operating Costs shall automatically become due and payable quarterly in advance, rather than monthly, notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, until Tenant has thereafter timely paid, on before the due date, Base Monthly Rent, Reimbursable Operating Costs and property management fees for a twelve (12) consecutive full calendar month period, at which time Base Monthly Rent, Reimbursable Operating Costs and property management fees shall revert back to being payable monthly (subject however to reverting to quarterly payment if thereafter a late charge is payable hereunder, whether or not collected, for three (3) consecutive installments of Base Monthly Rent). In no event shall this provision for a late charge be deemed to grant to Tenant a grace period or extension of time within which to pay any amount due under this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be entitled to one (1) written notice and five (5) day cure period each calendar year before the first late charge for such calendar year shall accrue. No notice or additional cure period shall be required or apply for the second or any subsequent late charge during the calendar year.</p>

          <p id="s1p100">A.</p>
          <p id="s1p101">Amount and Purpose:</p>
          <p id="s1p102">Not later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, Tenant shall provide Landlord an irrevocable standby letter of credit (as replaced or amended pursuant to this Section 5, the “Letter of Credit”) in the amount of Nine Hundred Seventy Thousand One Hundred Fifty Seven Dollars and Sixty Five Cents ($970,157.65) in a form, containing terms, issued by a lending institution, and drawable in a location all reasonably acceptable to Landlord (the Letter of Credit and all proceeds thereof, and all other sums paid to Landlord in substitution of the foregoing, being referred to as the “Security Deposit”). Landlord hereby approves JP Morgan Chase as an acceptable issuer of the Letter of Credit, so long as there is no material negative change in such issuer’s credit rating or ability to meet its obligations. If Tenant defaults beyond applicable notice and cure periods with respect to any provisions of the Lease, including but not limited to (i) the provisions relating to payment of Base Monthly Rent or other charges in default, or any other amount which Landlord may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of Tenant’s default, or (ii) breach of any of Tenant’s obligations under this Section 5, Landlord shall be entitled to draw the full amount of the Letter of Credit or any portion thereof at any time by certifying the occurrence of such default to the issuer; thereafter, as to any cash remaining from the drawdown of the Letter of Credit and application of the amounts drawn to amounts owned to Landlord, such portion of the Security Deposit shall be in the form of cash held by Landlord. Tenant’s failure to timely comply with its obligations under this Section 5 shall constitute a material default of Tenant, for which no notice or opportunity to cure shall apply or be required before Landlord is entitled to draw the full amount of the Letter of Credit or any portion thereof, time being of the essence as to Tenant’s obligations under this Section 5. The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for the faithful performance by Tenant of every term, covenant and condition of this Lease applicable to Tenant, and not as prepayment of rent. Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, and without waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligation under this Lease, use, apply or retain the whole or any part of the Security Deposit reasonably necessary for the payment of any amount which Landlord may spend by reason of Tenant’s default or as necessary to compensate Landlord for any loss or damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of Tenant’s default, including without limitation loss of future rents due under this Lease upon termination of this Lease due to a default by Tenant and other damages recoverable under California Civil Code Section 1951.2. Landlord shall not be deemed a trustee of the Security Deposit or any other funds held by Landlord, and Landlord shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit</p>
          <p id="s1p103">-11-</p>
          <p id="s1p104">or any such other funds separate from its general funds. The Security Deposit and such other funds shall not bear interest for the benefit of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p105">B.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">Requirements of Letter of Credit:</p>
          <p id="s1p107">Tenant shall keep the Letter of Credit in effect during the entire Lease Term, as the same may be extended, plus a period of four (4) weeks following the Expiration Date (the “Outside LOC Expiration Date”). At least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of any Letter of Credit, the term thereof shall be renewed or extended for a period of at least one (1) year until the Outside LOC Expiration Date. If the issuer of the Letter of Credit becomes insolvent, is closed or is placed in receivership, or if Landlord is notified that the Letter of Credit will not be honored, or if there is a material negative change in the issuer’s credit rating or ability to meet its obligations, then within seven (7) business days after demand from Landlord, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a new Letter of Credit issued by a lending institution acceptable to Landlord in Landlord’s reasonable discretion, and otherwise meeting the requirements of this Section 5. In the event Landlord draws against the Letter of Credit and applies any portion of the proceeds thereof to the amounts owed to Landlord, Tenant shall replenish the remaining Security Deposit (by cash, additional letter of credit or replacement letter of credit meeting the requirements of this Section 5) such that the aggregate amount of Security Deposit available to Landlord at all times during the Lease Term is the amount of the Security Deposit originally required, as the same may be required to be increased as provided above. If at any time while a Letter of Credit is held as a Security Deposit, Tenant is a Debtor (as defined in Section 101(13) of the Bankruptcy Code) under any case or filing, then, anything in this Section 5 to the contrary notwithstanding, Landlord shall not be required to give Tenant written notice of and/or opportunity to cure or grace period to cure any default under this Lease prior to Landlord drawing upon the Letter of Credit following Tenant’s failure to perform any of its obligations under this Lease. The Security Deposit shall be returned to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the Expiration Date and surrender of the Premises to Landlord in the condition required by this Lease, less any amount deducted in accordance with this Section 5, together with Landlord’s written notice itemizing the amounts and purposes for such deduction; provided however that if at the end of such thirty (30) day period there are any uncured breaches by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease and the cost of cure or extent of damage as a result has not yet been ascertained by Landlord, then such thirty (30) day period shall be extended as reasonably necessary for Landlord to ascertain the cost of cure and extent to which Landlord has been damaged as a result thereof. Tenant hereby waives California Civil Code Section 1950.7, or any similar law now or hereafter in effect (including, without limitation, any federal law) to the extent the same has the effect of limiting the circumstances under which Landlord would be allowed to use or apply the Security Deposit or amount that could be so used or applied, or imposing a deadline for the return of the Security Deposit. In the event of termination of Landlord’s interest in this Lease, Landlord shall deliver the Letter of Credit or cash Security Deposit to Landlord’s successor in interest in the Premises that is bound by this Section 5 and thereupon be relieved of further responsibility with respect to the Letter of Credit or cash Security Deposit; provided, however, that if Tenant fails to timely perform its obligations under the next sentence, Landlord shall have the right, upon request of Landlord’s successor, to draw on the Letter of Credit on behalf of Landlord’s successor. Upon termination or transfer of Landlord’s interest in the Lease, within five (5) days after request by Landlord or Landlord’s successor, Tenant shall either cause the Letter of Credit to be amended to name Landlord’s successor as the party entitled to draw down on the Letter of Credit and deliver such amendment to the requesting party, or shall obtain and deliver to the requesting party a new Letter of Credit naming Landlord’s successor as the party entitled to draw on the Letter of Credit and otherwise meeting the requirement of this Section 5. Landlord shall have the right to pledge the Letter of Credit or cash Security Deposit or otherwise grant a security interest therein to Landlord’s lenders, and shall have the right to deliver the Letter of Credit or all or any portion of any cash Security Deposit to Landlord’s lenders in connection therewith, provided the Letter of Credit or cash Security Deposit shall only be used in accordance with, and shall continue to be governed by, the terms and provisions of this Section 5. At Landlord’s election, within ten (10) days after request by Landlord, Tenant shall either cause the Letter of Credit to be amended to name Landlord’s lenders as the beneficiary or as a co-</p>

          <p id="s1p109">beneficiary with Landlord, and/or as a co-signer of any certification presented for a draw down of the Letter of Credit, and to incorporate other changes to the Letter of Credit reasonably requested by Landlord or Landlord’s lenders, or shall obtain a new Letter of Credit to effectuate such changes and otherwise meeting the requirements of this Section 5. If a new Letter of Credit is delivered to Landlord as required by this Section 5.B, the old Letter of Credit shall be promptly returned to Tenant. If Landlord or a designated lender rightfully attempts to draw on the Letter of Credit but does not receive the full amount requested in cash, Tenant shall within five (5) days after demand from Landlord, deposit with Landlord cash in the amount of the deficiency, provided that the total amount of the unapplied Security Deposit held by Landlord (whether in the form or cash or letter or credit or combination thereof) shall not exceed the total amount of Security Deposit required by this Section 5.</p>

If Tenant fails to notify Landlord in writing of any work required to bring the Premises into the condition described in the immediately prior sentence before the end of the ninety (90) day period required by the immediately prior sentence, Landlord shall have no further obligation to remedy such deficiency, except that to the extent such work is covered by warranties remaining in effect Landlord shall pursue enforcement of such warranties. The existence of any such deficiency shall not cause an extension of or delay in the Commencement Date. Notwithstanding this Section above, Landlord shall not have any obligation to modify, upgrade or do any other work to bring the Building into compliance with applicable laws, codes and regulations (including, without limitation, the ADA) to the extent such work is required because any portion of the Tenant Improvements include improvements that are not standard office improvements (as reasonably determined by Landlord).</p>

Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to Substantially Complete Landlord’s Work by August 15, 2015, subject in each case to extension in the event of and equal to any delays in completion caused by a Tenant Delay (defined below); provided however that in no event shall Landlord be required to perform such work during non-business hours or on weekends or holidays. In no event shall Landlord’s failure to complete Landlord’s Work by any particular date cause this Lease to be void or voidable or subject Landlord to any liability as a result thereof; except that (i) if the Amenities Building Work has not been completed by August 15, 2015 for any reason other than a Tenant Delay (defined below), or (ii) if the Collaborative Area Work has not been completed by August 15, 2015 for any reason other than a Tenant Delay, then the Commencement Date shall be extended one (1) day for each such day of delay in completion.</p>

When Tenant’s final plans and specifications for the Tenant Improvements have been approved by Landlord and the City, such plans and specifications shall be identified in an exhibit which shall be attached to this Lease as Exhibit “B”. Landlord’s Work shall not constitute Tenant Improvements under this Lease. The architect and general contractor involved in the design and construction of the Tenant Improvements shall be subject to Landlord’s prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Landlord hereby approves of Tenant’s use of Permian Builders as a General Contractor and ArcTec, Inc. as an architect. All Tenant Improvements shall be constructed by Tenant in accordance with the plans and specification approved by Landlord, and shall be consistent with Class A construction and quality provided however, that the foregoing shall not require Tenant to comply with any particular LEED or similar voluntary green building certification except to the extent required by the City or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction. All Tenant Improvements are subject to Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

The Work Allowance shall be paid by Landlord to the third parties entitled to payment in accordance with this Section 6.C below. During the course of design and construction of the Tenant Improvements, but not more than once in any calendar month, if Tenant desires a disbursement of the Work Allowance, Tenant and Tenant’s General Contractor shall deliver to Landlord the following (the “Disbursement Documentation”): (i) a written request for disbursement, setting forth the amount requested for disbursement (“Disbursement Request”); (ii) a schedule of values allocating costs to the various portions of the Tenant Improvements for which disbursement is sought, in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, and which shall substantiate that the full amount requested for disbursement has been incurred or expended by Tenant for those Tenant Improvements for which the Work Allowance may be utilized; (iii) evidence of costs incurred of all amounts owed to the applicable third party, in form reasonably acceptable to Landlord, (iv) conditional lien releases, in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, from the General Contractor and all subcontractors, material suppliers and other persons or entities providing work or materials for which the current Disbursement Request relates, (v) unconditional lien releases, in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, from the General Contractor and all subcontractors, material suppliers and other persons or entities providing work or materials for which prior disbursements were made from the Work Allowance, to the extent not already delivered to Landlord; and (vi) invoices, vouchers, statements, affidavits and/or other documents in a form reasonably acceptable to Landlord which substantiate and justify the disbursement requested.

In this regard, “normal wear and tear” shall be construed to mean wear and tear caused to the Premises by the natural aging process which occurs in spite of prudent application of commercially reasonable standards (from a landlord’s perspective) for maintenance, repair, replacement, and janitorial practices, and does not include items of neglected or deferred maintenance. In any event, Tenant shall cause the following to be done prior to the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease (whichever</p>
          <p id="s1p144">-16-</p>
          <p id="s1p145">is earlier) to the extent Tenant is not required to remove any of the following pursuant to other provisions of this Lease: (i) all interior walls shall be cleaned, (ii) all tiled floors shall be cleaned, (iii) all carpets shall be cleaned, (iv) all broken, marred, stained or nonconforming acoustical ceiling tiles shall be replaced, (v) all cabling placed above the ceiling by Tenant or Tenant’s contractors shall be removed, (vi) [intentionally deleted], (vii) the HVAC system shall be serviced by a reputable and licensed service firm and left in “good operating condition and repair”, which condition shall also be so certified by such firm, and (viii) the plumbing and electrical systems and lighting shall be placed in good order and repair (including replacement of any burned out, discolored or broken light bulbs, ballasts, or lenses). On or before the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease (whichever is earlier), Tenant shall remove all its personal property and trade fixtures from the Premises. All property and trade fixtures not so removed shall be deemed to have been abandoned by Tenant. As to Alterations for which Landlord’s consent was not obtained, Tenant shall ascertain from Landlord not more than one (1) year and not less than ninety (90) days before the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease (whichever is earlier) whether Landlord desires to have any Alterations made by Tenant (as defined in Section 8 below) removed and the Premises or any parts thereof restored to the condition existing prior to the making of such Alteration, with any upgrades or revisions required to comply with all applicable building codes and other Laws in effect at the time of such removal and restoration to the extent such compliance is necessitated by the removal, repair and restoration work, or to cause Tenant to surrender all Alterations in place to Landlord. In addition, if at the time Tenant obtains Landlord’s consent to any Alterations Landlord advises Tenant that any Alterations must be removed, then Tenant shall be required to surrender the Premises on the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the Lease (whichever is earlier) with such Alterations removed and the Premises restored to the condition existing prior to the making of such Alteration, with any upgrades or revisions required to comply with all applicable building codes and other Laws in effect at the time of such removal and restoration to the extent such compliance is necessitated by the removal, repair and restoration work; but if at the time Tenant obtains Landlord’s consent to an Alteration Landlord fails to advise Tenant that such Alteration must be removed then Tenant shall not be required to remove such Alteration. Tenant’s repair and restoration obligation shall include causing the Premises to be brought into compliance with all applicable building codes and other Laws in effect at the time of the removal, repair and restoration to the extent such compliance is necessitated by the removal, repair and restoration work. The foregoing provisions relating to Alterations for which Landlord’s consent was not obtained shall in no event be construed as giving Tenant the right to do any Alterations without Landlord’s consent (except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 8 below). Notwithstanding this Section 7.A above, in no event shall Tenant be required to remove any elements of the Tenant Improvements that are typical of an open interior office plan. For purposes of this Lease, an open interior office plan means (i) offices and conference rooms (not including the EBC (defined below)), with not more than fifty percent (50%) in the aggregate of the Deemed Building Square Footage on each floor of a Building being offices that are partitioned, enclosed or built out (other than open workspace cubicles which are not hard wall construction) or conference rooms that are partitioned, (ii) not more than five percent (5%) of the Deemed Building Square Footage on each floor of a Building being offices on the exterior window line (which window line offices shall be included in the calculation of the fifty percent (50%) aggregate threshold described in item (i) immediately above), and (iii) one (1) executive briefing center (“EBC”) in only one (1) of the Buildings, which EBC is not more than twenty percent (20%) of the Deemed Building Square Footage in such Building.</p>

If Tenant holds over after the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease with Landlord’s consent, such holding over shall be construed as a month to month tenancy, at one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base Monthly Rent for the month preceding the Expiration Date or termination of this Lease (whichever occurs earlier) (without regard to temporary abatements then in effect) in addition to all other rent due under this Lease, and shall otherwise be on the terms and conditions of this Lease, except for the following: those provisions relating to the Lease Term to the extent inconsistent with a month to month tenancy, any provisions requiring Landlord to perform any Landlord’s Work or install any Tenant Improvements or otherwise relating to the delivery of the Premises to Tenant, or pay any work allowances, space planning allowance or grant any free rent or other concessions and any options or rights to extend or renew this Lease, which provisions shall be of no further force and effect. Notwithstanding this Section 7.B above, if Tenant surrenders the Premises to Landlord but it is not in the condition required by this Lease, Tenant shall be deemed in holdover without Landlord’s consent only so long as it would reasonably take for Landlord to perform such work as is necessary to render the Premises in the required condition. All hard and soft costs incurred by Landlord in connection with such work shall be paid for by Tenant to Landlord not later than thirty (30) days after demand for payment is delivered to Tenant, which obligation shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. This Section 7.B shall survive the termination or expiration of the Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p154">General Provisions:</p>
          <p id="s1p155">Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 8.A, Tenant shall not make, or suffer to be made, any alteration or addition to the Premises (“Alterations”), or any part thereof, without obtaining Landlord’s prior written consent and delivering to Landlord the proposed architectural and structural plans for all such Alterations at least fifteen (15) days prior to the start of construction. All Tenant Improvements shall also constitute “Alterations” under this Lease. If such Alterations affect the structure of the Building, Tenant additionally agrees to reimburse Landlord its reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in reviewing Tenant’s plans. After obtaining Landlord’s consent, Tenant shall not proceed to make such Alterations until Tenant has obtained all required governmental approvals and permits, and if the costs of the Alterations will exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate and at the time of the proposed Alterations Tenant does not have cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments, in the aggregate, of Seven Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($750,000,000) or more, then Tenant must also provide Landlord reasonable security, in form reasonably approved by Landlord, to protect Landlord against mechanics’ lien claims, before commencing such work. Tenant agrees to provide Landlord (i) not less than fifteen (15) days prior written notice of the anticipated and actual start-date of the work, (ii) a complete set of half-size (15” X 21”) vellum as-built drawings, and (iii) a certificate of occupancy, or other final government approval if the City does not</p>

All Alterations shall be constructed by a licensed general contractor reasonably acceptable to Landlord in compliance with all applicable Laws including, without limitation, all building codes, Sustainability Requirements and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended from time to time. Upon the Expiration Date or termination of this Lease (whichever occurs earlier), all Alterations, except movable furniture and trade fixtures, shall become a part of the realty and belong to Landlord, except to the extent Tenant is required to remove Alterations pursuant to this Section or Section 7.A above. Alterations which are not to be deemed trade fixtures include heating, lighting, electrical systems, air conditioning, walls, carpeting, or any installation which has become an integral part of the Premises. All Alterations shall be maintained, replaced or repaired by Tenant at its sole cost and expense. In no event shall Landlord’s approval of, or consent to, any architect, contractor, engineer or other consultant or professional, any Alterations, or any plans, specifications and drawings for any Alterations constitute a representation or warranty by Landlord of (i) the accuracy or completeness of the plans, specifications, drawings and Alterations or the absence of design defects or construction flaws therein, or the qualification of any person or entity, or (ii) compliance with applicable Laws, and Tenant agrees that Landlord shall incur no liability by reason of such approval or consent. Once any Alterations begin, Tenant shall diligently and continuously pursue their completion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may, without Landlord’s prior written consent, make non-structural Alterations to the Premises which do not affect the structure, roof or Building systems and are not visible from outside the Building, provided that (i) such Alterations do not exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) aggregate in a calendar year, and (ii) Tenant otherwise complies with the provisions of this Lease relating to Alterations. Tenant’s trade fixtures, furniture, office equipment (including servers and related equipment) and other personal property installed in the Premises (“Tenant’s Property”) shall at all times be and remain the property of Tenant (unless deemed abandoned as provided elsewhere in this Lease), and may be removed by Tenant at any time during the Lease Term provided that Tenant repairs all damage caused by such removal, except as provided in Section 2 above as it relates to Tenant’s loose furniture in the café or outdoor courtyard.</p>

          <p id="s1p160">Tenant shall keep the Premises free from all liens arising out of work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by Tenant or claimed to have been performed for or furnished to Tenant. In the event Tenant fails to discharge any such lien within fifteen (15) days after receiving notice of the filing, Landlord shall immediately be entitled to discharge the lien at Tenant’s expense and all resulting costs incurred by Landlord, including reasonable attorney’s fees shall be due immediately from Tenant as additional rent.</p>

Except as expressly provided in Section 6.A above, Tenant, at Tenant’s sole expense shall comply with all such Governmental Regulations applicable to the Premises or the Tenant’s use of the Premises and shall make all repairs, replacements, alterations, or improvements necessary to comply with said Governmental Regulations. The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Tenant in any action or proceeding against Tenant (whether Landlord be a party thereto or not) that Tenant has violated any such law, regulation or other requirement in its use of the Premises shall be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant. Tenant’s obligations pursuant to this Section 8.C shall include, without limitation, maintaining and restoring the Premises and making structural and nonstructural alterations and additions to the Premises, Building and Common Area in compliance and conformity with all Laws and recorded documents to the extent required because of Tenant’s</p>

Landlord’s approval of any Alteration or other act by Tenant shall not be deemed to be a representation by Landlord that said Alteration or act complies with applicable Laws, and Tenant shall remain solely responsible for said compliance.</p>

In addition to and without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, Tenant shall ensure that its contractors procure and maintain in full force and effect during the course of construction a “broad form” commercial general liability and property damage policy of insurance naming Landlord, any property manager designated by Landlord and Landlord’s lenders and any affiliates of Landlord that are designated by Landlord from time to time as additional insureds. The minimum limit of coverage of the aforesaid policy shall be in the amount of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) per occurrence and Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) annual aggregate, and shall contain a severability of interest clause or a cross liability endorsement. If Commercial General Liability Insurance or other form with a general aggregate limit is used, either the general aggregate limit shall apply separately to this project/location or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence limit. In no event shall the amount or type of insurance maintained or required to be maintained by Tenant or any of its contractors under this Lease in any way limit Tenant’s liability under this Lease, including without limitation any indemnification, defense or hold harmless provision in favor of Landlord under this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p182">Notwithstanding this Section 9.B above, if Tenant determines that any Building components located in or servicing the Premises which Tenant is required to repair (other than Tenant Improvements or Alterations or work required of Tenant to comply with applicable Laws pursuant to Section 8.C) are in need of material repair or replacement, and (i) the cost of such repair replacement is in excess of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000), and (ii) the material repair or replacement constitutes a capital cost under generally accepted accounting principles, then Tenant shall notify Landlord of same in writing. If Tenant notifies Landlord of the foregoing pursuant to the prior sentence, then Landlord shall cause such repair or replacement (whether an item is repaired or replaced shall be determined by Landlord in its reasonable discretion) to be made, subject to reimbursement by Tenant as follows: The entire cost incurred by Landlord with respect to such work, together with interest thereon at the Agreed Interest Rate, shall be amortized over the useful life of the capital repair or replacement, as reasonably determined by Landlord in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the monthly amortized cost (and interest thereon) shall be a Reimbursable Operating Cost to be paid by Tenant under this Lease until the earlier of the Expiration Date or the date that the entire cost of such work and interest thereon has been reimbursed to Landlord.</p>

Landlord shall have the right to periodically provide Tenant with a written estimate of Reimbursable Operating Costs for the next twelve (12) months and Tenant shall thereafter, until Landlord revises such estimate, pay to Landlord as</p>

The Annual Statement shall be certified by an authorized officer of Landlord to be correct. If the Annual Statement shows that Tenant’s payments of estimated Reimbursable Operating Costs exceeded Tenant’s actual obligation in respect of such calendar year, Landlord shall accompany said Annual Statement with a payment to Tenant of the amount of such excess. If the Annual Statement shows that Tenant’s payments of estimated Reimbursable Operating Costs were less than its actual obligation in respect of such calendar year, Tenant shall pay said difference to Landlord within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of the Annual Statement.</p>
          <p id="s1p188">If Tenant disputes the amount or characterization of any item contained in the Annual Statement then Tenant shall give written notice thereof to Landlord not later than ninety (90) days after the Annual Statement is delivered to Tenant. Tenant shall then have the right to cause Landlord's records upon which the Annual Statement is based to be audited by an independent nationally recognized certified public accounting firm. Such auditor shall require the consent of Landlord to enter upon Landlord's offices to inspect Landlord's books which consent shall be granted in subject to Landlord's reasonable scheduling, confidentiality and security requirements. Except as provided below, the fee for any audit conducted on Tenant's behalf shall be borne solely by Tenant. In no event shall the fee for any audit be computed on a contingency fee basis or be otherwise dependent upon the findings of such audit, and Tenant shall demonstrate to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction the non-contingent nature of the contract between Tenant and such auditor. Tenant shall not have any right to withhold any payment pending resolution of such dispute or audit, and payment by Tenant of any sum or sums in dispute shall not be deemed to be a waiver of Tenant’s right to audit or contest the Annual Statement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Lease. Landlord shall cooperate with such audit and shall provide Landlord’s books and records reasonably requested and relative to the audit which shall be conducted during regular business hours at the office where Landlord maintains its books and records, at no cost to Landlord except as expressly provided below. If after such audit the parties do not agree on the audit findings then the dispute shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to Section 20.E below. If, as a result of Tenant's inspection of Landlord's books or the findings of the third party independent audit of Landlord's records and review, an error is discovered in the Annual Statement, Landlord shall revise the Annual Statement accordingly and any overpayment by Tenant shall be refunded by Landlord to Tenant not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by Landlord of written demand for payment, and any underpayment shall be paid by Tenant not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by Tenant of written demand for payment. If Tenant does not notify Landlord of a dispute within ninety (90) days after receipt of any Annual Statement, Tenant shall be deemed to have accepted such Annual Statement and waived its right to dispute the Annual Statement or conduct an audit with respect to the Annual Statement. Landlord's records and any information provided by Landlord to auditors pursuant to this Section, and the results of any such audit, shall be kept confidential by Tenant and its auditors, and shall not be made available by the auditors or Tenant to any other person or entity except to Tenant’s parent or affiliates and outside legal and financial representatives and except in any dispute resolution proceeding between the parties relating to such audit. If requested by Landlord, Tenant and its auditor shall, prior to any such audit, execute and deliver to Landlord a confidentiality agreement prepared by Landlord, reasonably acceptable to Tenant. If the final audit discloses an error in Landlord’s determination of the Reimbursable Operating Costs in excess of five percent (5%) in Landlord’s favor (i.e. the Annual Statement overstated Reimbursable Operating Costs by more than five percent (5%)), then all reasonable out-of-pocket costs of the audits shall be borne by Landlord; otherwise the cost of the audits shall be borne by Tenant.</p>

Reimbursable Operating Costs shall include, but not be limited to, the following to the extent the obligation therefor is not that of Tenant under the provisions of Section 9.B above: (i) common area utilities, including water, power, telephone, heating, lighting, air conditioning, ventilating, Amenities Building utilities, and Building utilities to the extent not separately metered to the Building; (ii) common area maintenance and service agreements for the Buildings, Amenities Building and/or Project and the fixtures and equipment therein, including without limitation, common area janitorial services, alarm and security services (if provided), exterior window cleaning, fees of the operators of the Amenities Building if Landlord hires such operators pursuant to Section 2 above, and maintenance of the sidewalks, landscaping, waterscape, parking areas, driveways, service areas, mechanical rooms, elevators, Amenities Building, and the building exteriors; (iii) insurance premiums and costs, including without limitation, the premiums and cost of All Risk property coverage (including Business Interruption), Liability coverage, Environmental Liability coverage and if elected by Landlord, earthquake insurance applicable to the Buildings or Project subject to the cost limitations set forth in Section 10 below; (iv) repairs, replacements and general maintenance (excluding repairs and general maintenance paid by proceeds of insurance or by Tenant or other third parties other than as Reimbursable Operating Costs, and repairs or alterations attributable solely to tenants of the Buildings or Project other than Tenant), including without limitation those relating the Amenities Building and the fixtures and equipment therein (repair, replacements and maintenance of the exercise equipment, and other furniture and furnishings provided by Landlord (if any) to be expensed and not treated of capital costs, but replacement of base building systems, to the extent considered capital costs pursuant to GAAP, to be treated as capital costs); (v) all real estate taxes and assessment installments or other impositions or charges which may be levied on the Buildings or Project, upon the occupancy of the Buildings or Project and including any substitute or additional charges which may be imposed during, or applicable to the Lease Term including real estate tax increases due to a sale, transfer or other change of ownership of the Buildings or Project, as such taxes are levied or appear on the City and County tax bills and assessment rolls; (vi) costs of complying with Sustainability Requirements; (vii) deductibles under insurance policies, except for earthquake deductibles to the extent in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000); (viii) the wages and benefits of all employees devoting time on operating or managing the Project, provided that as to any employee who does not devote substantially all of his or her employed time to the Project, that employee’s wages and benefits shall be prorated to reflect the time spent on operating or managing the Project as opposed time spent on matters unrelated to operating and managing the Project, (ix) capital expenditures if required by Laws, or to repair or replace existing capital items, or to increase efficiencies and save costs in the Building(s) to the extent not in excess of the cost of such savings, all of which shall be amortized over their useful lives as reasonably determined by Landlord in accordance with GAAP, together with interest on the unpaid portion of such expenditure at the Agreed Interest Rate, and (x) any of items (i) through (viii) in Section 9.B above to the extent Landlord has assumed with respect thereto the obligation for cleaning, maintenance repair or replacement. Landlord shall have no obligation to provide guard services or other security measures for the benefit of the Project, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Landlord, at its sole option, from providing security measures for the Project. Notwithstanding Landlord’s election to provide security measures for the Project, Tenant assumes all responsibility for the protection of Tenant and Tenant’s Agents from acts of third parties. This is a “Net” Lease, meaning that Base Monthly Rent is paid to Landlord absolutely net of all costs and expenses, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease. The provision for payment of Reimbursable Operating Costs by means of monthly payment of Tenant’s Allocable Share of the Buildings and/or Project costs is intended to pass on to Tenant and reimburse Landlord for all costs of operating and managing the Buildings and/or Project, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease.

Should any equipment or machinery utilized in supplying the services listed herein as being Landlord’s obligation break down or for any cause cease to function properly, upon receipt of written notice from Tenant of any deficiency or failure of any services, Landlord shall use reasonable diligence to repair the same promptly, but Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease and shall have no claim for rebate of rent or damages on account of any interruptions in service occasioned thereby or resulting therefrom. Tenant waives the provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1941 and 1942 concerning the Landlord’s obligation of tenantability and Tenant’s right to make repairs and deduct the cost of such repairs from the rent, and any similar Law now or hereafter in effect. Landlord shall not be liable for a loss of or injury to person or property, however occurring, through or in connection with or incidental to furnishing, or its failure to furnish, any of the foregoing.</p>

          <p id="s1p209">Landlord agrees to purchase and keep in force All Risk insurance (or its equivalent or industry replacement) in an amount equal to the replacement cost of the Buildings and Parking Structure (excluding any Tenant Improvements and Alterations that are not typical or customary for offices uses (“Specialized Tenant Improvements”) and other than Alterations for which Landlord’s consent is not obtained). In addition, Landlord may elect to purchase insurance coverage for perils including earthquake, flood and/or terrorist acts, in amounts and with deductibles reasonably determined by Landlord. Earthquake insurance premiums incurred by Landlord and included in Reimbursable Operating Costs shall not exceed Sixteen Thousand Dollars ($16,000) per month (the “Earthquake Premium Cap”) for the first (1st) year of the Lease Term. The Earthquake Premium Cap shall be subject to increase annually commencing on the first anniversary of the Commencement Date and every anniversary thereafter in the event of an increase in the Consumer Price Index (each such anniversary date being an “Adjustment Date”). The basis for computing the adjustment shall be the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistic’s Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, All Items, 1982-84=100, for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose area (“Index”). The Index most recently published preceding the Commencement Date shall be considered the “Base Index” for the first adjustment. Thereafter, the index most recently published preceding the previous Adjustment Date shall be considered the “Base Index.” If the Index most recently published preceding the Adjustment Date (“Comparison Index”) is greater than the Base Index, the then-payable Earthquake Premium Cap shall be increased by multiplying the then-applicable Earthquake Premium Cap by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Comparison Index and the denominator of which is the Base Index. Notwithstanding any subsequent actual increase or decrease in the Index, the increase in the Earthquake Premium Cap for any Adjustment Date shall never be more than four percent (4%) of the Earthquake Premium Cap in effect immediately before such adjustment. In no event shall the Earthquake Premium Cap decrease due to a decrease in the Index. Landlord may also maintain a policy of (i) commercial general liability insurance insuring Landlord (and such others designated by Landlord) against liability for personal injury, bodily injury, death and damage to property occurring or resulting from an occurrence in, on or about the Premises or Project in an amount as Landlord determines is reasonably necessary for its protection, (ii) rental loss insurance covering a minimum of twelve (12) months and (iii) Environmental Impairment/Pollution Liability coverage. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord as additional rent, within thirty (30) days after written invoice to Tenant, Tenant’s Allocable Share of the amount of any deductible under such policy (subject to the cap on earthquake deductibles described in Section 9.D), provided that if damage is confined to the Premises, Tenant shall pay the entire deductible to Landlord (subject to the cap on earthquake deductibles described in Section 9.D). It is understood and agreed that Tenant’s obligation to pay insurance premiums under this Section 10.B will be prorated to reflect the Commencement Date and Expiration Date.</p>

Said insurance shall provide All Risk coverage (or its equivalent or industry replacement) equal to the replacement cost of said property. The property insurance provided by Tenant as required by this paragraph shall be carried in favor of Landlord and Tenant as their respective interests may appear and shall provide that any loss to Alterations shall be adjusted with and be payable to both Landlord and Tenant. Tenant shall deliver a copy of the policy and renewal certificate to Landlord. Tenant agrees, at its sole cost, to obtain and maintain throughout the Lease Term Commercial General Liability insurance for occurrences within the Project with a combined single limit of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00), worker’s compensation insurance in compliance with statutory requirements, and Employer’s Liability with a limit of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00). Tenant may meet the Commercial General Liability and Employer’s Liability insurance requirements described in the prior sentence with an excess liability insurance policy, so long as the full amount of coverage required above is provided. Tenant’s liability insurance shall be primary insurance containing a cross-liability endorsement, and shall provide coverage on an “occurrence” rather than on a “claims made” basis. All such insurance shall provide for</p>

Tenant shall provide a waiver of subrogation in favor of Landlord, Landlord’s affiliates and property manager for worker’s compensation and employer’s liability. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of the certificates of such insurance evidencing the coverage required of Tenant prior to the earlier of the first Commencement Date or first entry to ready any portion of the Premises for Tenant’s occupancy, and within five (5) days after renewal of such policies, but in no event later than five (5) days after the scheduled expiration of such policies. If any policy required of Tenant is cancelled, terminated or reduced in coverage, Tenant shall notify Landlord of such changes not later than five (5) business days after Tenant becomes aware of such change. Notwithstanding the above, Landlord retains the right to have Tenant provide other forms of insurance which may be reasonably required to cover future risks. In no event shall the types or limits of any insurance policies maintained or required to be maintained under this Lease by Tenant or its contractors limit Tenant’s liability under this Lease, including without limitation Tenant’s indemnification, defense and hold harmless obligations.</p>

In the event that a tax is placed, levied, or assessed against Landlord and the taxing authority takes the position that Tenant cannot pay and discharge its Allocable Share of such tax on behalf of Landlord, then at Landlord’s sole election, Landlord may increase the Base Monthly Rent by the exact amount of such tax and Tenant shall pay such increase. If by virtue of any application or proceeding brought by Landlord, there results a reduction in the assessed value of the Premises during the Lease Term, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord a fee consistent with the fees charged by a third party appeal firm for such services.</p>

          <p id="s1p260">In the event of any default by Tenant beyond applicable notice and cure periods, then in addition to other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, Landlord shall have the immediate option to terminate this Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder by giving written notice of such intention to terminate. In the event Landlord elects to so terminate this Lease, Landlord may recover from Tenant all the following: (i) the worth at time of award of any unpaid rent which had been earned at the time of such termination; (ii) the worth at time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss for the same period that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the Lease Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease, or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom; including the following: (x) expenses for repairing, altering or remodeling the Premises for purposes of reletting, (y) broker’s fees, advertising costs or other expenses of reletting the Premises, and (z) costs of carrying the Premises such as taxes, insurance premiums, utilities and security precautions; and (v) at Landlord’s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted by applicable California law. The term “rent”, as used in this Lease, is defined as the minimum monthly installments of Base Monthly Rent and all other sums required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, all such other sums being deemed as additional rent due hereunder. As used in (i) and (ii) above, “worth at the time of award” shall be computed by allowing interest at a rate equal to the greater of the following (the “Agreed Interest Rate”) (i) the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco plus five (5%) percent per annum, as of the twenty-fifty (25th) day of the month immediately preceding Tenant’s default, on advances to member banks under Section 13 and 13(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, as now in effect or hereafter from time to time amended, or (ii) ten percent (10%) per annum. As used in (iii) above, “worth at the time of award” shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one (1%) percent. Any obligation Landlord may have to mitigate damages upon a termination due to Tenant’s default shall not include the obligation to relet the Premises if Landlord has other comparable available space within the Building or Project.</p>

          <p id="s1p274">Landlord may accept Tenant’s payments without waiving any rights under this Lease, including rights under a previously served notice of default. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than any installment of rent due shall be deemed as other than payment on account of the amount due. If Landlord accepts payments after serving a notice of default, Landlord may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Tenant any further notice or demand. Furthermore, Landlord’s acceptance of rent from the Tenant when the Tenant is holding over without express written consent does not convert Tenant’s tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month to month tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Lease shall be implied by any failure of Landlord to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision, even if that violation continues or is repeated. Any waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease must be in writing. Such waiver shall affect only the provision specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Landlord shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof by Landlord. No act or conduct of Landlord, including, without limitation, the acceptance of keys to the Premises, shall constitute acceptance of the surrender of the Premises by Tenant before the Expiration Date. Only written notice from Landlord to Tenant of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance of surrender of the Premises. Landlord’s consent to or approval of any act by Tenant which requires Landlord’s consent or approvals shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary Landlord’s consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Tenant. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant, or a mutual cancellation thereof, shall not work a merger and shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate all or any existing subleases or subtenants, or may, at the option of Landlord, operate as an assignment to Landlord of any or all such subleases or subtenants</p>

          <p id="s1p285">In the event of Landlord’s failure to perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Lease, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of such failure and shall give Landlord thirty (30) days to cure or commence to cure such failure prior to any claim for breach or resultant damages, provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such that it cannot reasonably be cured within the 30-day period, Landlord shall not be deemed in default if it commences within such period to cure, and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion. In addition, upon any such failure by Landlord, Tenant shall give notice by registered or certified mail to any person or entity with a security interest in the Premises (“Mortgagee”) that has provided Tenant with notice of its interest in the Premises, and shall provide Mortgagee a reasonable opportunity to cure such failure, including such time to obtain possession of the Premises by power of sale or judicial foreclosure or appointment of a receiver, if such should prove necessary to effectuate a cure. Tenant agrees that each of the Mortgagees to whom this Lease has been assigned is an express third-party beneficiary hereof. Tenant waives any right under California Civil Code Section 1950.7 or any other present or future law relating to the collection of any payment or deposit from Mortgagee or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale of Mortgagee’s interest unless Mortgagee or such purchaser shall have actually received and not refunded the applicable payment or deposit. Tenant further waives all rights to terminate this Lease and to vacate the Premises on Landlord’s default under this Lease, the Parties having agreed that Tenant’s remedies in the event of a Landlord default shall be limited to those expressly set forth in this Lease. Tenant’s sole remedy on Landlord’s default is an action for damages or injunctive or declaratory relief; provided, however, Landlord and the Landlord Related Parties shall not be liable to Tenant for any consequential damages suffered or incurred by Tenant on account of Landlord’s default including, without limitation, on account of lost profits or the interruption of Tenant’s business. Tenant hereby agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for injury to Tenant’s business or any loss of income therefrom or for damage to the goods, wares, merchandise, or other property of Tenant, Tenant’s employees, invitees, customers, or any other person in or about the Premises or the Project, nor shall Landlord be liable for injury to the person of Tenant, Tenant’s employees, agents, contractors, or any other person in or about the Premises or Project, whether such damage or injury is caused by or results from fire, steam, electricity, gas, water, or rain, or from the breakage, leakage, obstruction, or other defects of pipes, sprinklers, wires, appliances, plumbing, air conditioning, or lighting fixtures, or from any other cause, whether said damage or injury results from conditions arising upon the Premises or upon other portions of the Project or from other sources or places and regardless of whether the cause of such damage or injury or the means of repairing the same is inaccessible to Tenant. Landlord shall not be liable for any damages arising from any act or neglect of any other tenant, occupant, or user of the Project, nor from the failure of Landlord to enforce the provisions of any other lease of the Project.</p>

Tenant shall have recourse only to the interest of Landlord in the Premises and current net rent proceeds therefrom (after deduction of all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Project, including debt service) for the satisfaction of the obligations of Landlord and shall not have recourse to any other assets of Landlord for the satisfaction of such obligations.</p>

Except to the extent due to the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or a breach of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, Tenant shall indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord and hold Landlord and the Landlord Related Parties harmless from and against all claims, liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, actions, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including</p>

Further, in the event Landlord is made party to any litigation due to the acts or omission of Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, Tenant shall indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold Landlord and the Landlord Related Parties harmless from and against all claims, liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, actions, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with such litigation.</p>

Such damage or destruction shall not annul or void this Lease; however, Tenant shall be entitled to a proportionate reduction of Base Monthly Rent while repairs are being made, such proportionate reduction to be based upon the extent to which the repairs interfere with Tenant’s business in the Premises, as reasonably determined by Landlord. In no event shall Landlord be required to replace or restore Alterations for which Landlord’s consent was not obtained, Specialized Tenant Improvements or Tenant’s trade fixtures or personal property.</p>

          <p id="s1p301">Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16.A above, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair or restore a Building in which any portion of the Premises is located if any of the following occur: (i) if Landlord estimates the repairs cannot be made in three hundred sixty (360) days from the date of receipt of all governmental approvals necessary under applicable Laws, as reasonably determined by Landlord, (ii) if the holder of the first deed of trust or mortgage encumbering the Building elects not to permit the insurance proceeds payable upon damage or destruction to be used for such repair or restoration, (iii) the damage or destruction is not fully covered by the insurance maintained by Landlord, (iv) the damage or destruction occurs in the last twenty four (24) months of the Lease Term (taking into consideration all Options then exercised by Tenant), or (v) Tenant is in default pursuant to the provisions of Section 14 above; or (vi) Tenant has vacated the Premises in such Building for more than ninety (90) days before the casualty. In any such event Landlord may elect either to (i) complete the repair or restoration, or (ii) terminate this Lease as to only the damaged or destroyed Building by providing Tenant written notice of its election within sixty (60) days following the damage or destruction. If Landlord elects to repair or restore, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease as to just the one (1) Building pursuant to the prior sentence, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease as to both of the Buildings, by delivering written notice of Tenant’s election not later than twenty (20) days after Tenant was notified of Landlord’s termination election. If Tenant fails to deliver its written election to terminate the Lease as to both Buildings pursuant to the prior sentence within the required twenty (20) day period, then Tenant shall be deemed to have elected not to terminate this Lease as to both Buildings pursuant to the prior sentence. Tenant shall also have the right to terminate this Lease in the event either (1) Landlord estimates the repairs cannot be made in the three hundred sixty (360) days from the date of receipt of all governmental approvals necessary under applicable Laws, as</p>

Tenant hereby waives the benefits and rights provided to Tenant by the provisions of Civil Code Sections 1932 and 1933, or any similar Law now or hereafter in effect. If this Lease terminates as the result of any damage or destruction to Premises, all property insurance proceeds relating to Alterations maintained by Tenant shall be the sole property of Landlord, Tenant shall have no right to such proceeds, and Tenant shall fully cooperate with Landlord in collecting such proceeds, or if such proceeds have been paid to Tenant, Tenant shall pay such proceeds to Landlord not later than seven (7) business days after the Expiration Date or termination of this Lease (whichever is earlier), which obligations shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord not later than seven (7) business days after the Expiration Date or termination of this Lease (whichever is earlier) an amount equal to the deductible under Tenant’s property insurance, which obligation shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease. If Tenant fails to maintain the property insurance required by this Lease, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord, not later than seven (7) business days after the Expiration Date or termination of this Lease (whichever is earlier) an amount equal to what the proceeds would have been had Tenant maintained the insurance required by this Lease, plus the deductible that would have applied if such insurance had been in place.</p>

          <p id="s1p305">CONDEMNATION:</p>

Further, in the event of such partial taking, Landlord shall have the option to terminate this Lease as of the Vesting Date. If all of the Premises or such part thereof be taken so that there does not remain a portion susceptible for occupation hereunder, this Lease shall terminate on the Vesting Date. If part or all of the Premises be taken, all compensation awarded upon such taking shall go to Landlord, and Tenant shall have no claim thereto; except Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant, without cost to Landlord, to recover compensation for the unamortized cost of any Specialized Tenant Improvements and Alterations paid for by Tenant and not reimbursed through the Work Allowance or for Tenant’s moving costs. If there is a taking of any parking areas within Phase 1, substitute parking cannot be provided within Phase 1 by means of restriping the remaining existing parking areas within Phase 1, and Landlord does not provide replacement parking within Phase 2 or other property adjacent to Phase 1 or Phase 2, then the parking allocated to Tenant under this Lease shall be proportionately reduced. However, if the parking allocated to Tenant under this Lease is reduced by more than ten percent (10%) or there is a taking of more than fifteen percent (15%) of a Building, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease effective as of the Vesting Date or thirty (30) days after Tenant delivers its termination notice to Landlord, whichever is later. If any part of the Premises is taken but this Lease is not terminated, then Landlord shall, to the extent not prohibited by Laws and condemnation proceeds are sufficient to do so, repair any damage to the Premises caused by such taking to a condition reasonably suitable for Tenant’s continued operations. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedures Section 1265.130 and any similar Law now or hereafter in effect, and the provisions of this Section 17 shall govern in the case of a taking.</p>

In the event Tenant desires to effectuate a Transfer, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord (i) executed counterparts of any agreement and of all ancillary agreements with the proposed transferee, (ii) current financial statements of the transferee covering the preceding three (3) years, (iii) the nature of the proposed transferee’s business to be carried on in the Premises, (iv) a statement outlining all consideration to be given on account of the Transfer, and (v) a current financial statement of Tenant. Landlord may condition its approval of any Transfer on receipt of a certification from both Tenant and the proposed transferee of all consideration to be paid to Tenant in connection with such Transfer. At Landlord’s request, Tenant shall also provide additional information reasonably required by Landlord to determine whether it will consent to the proposed Transfer. Landlord shall have a fifteen (15) day period following receipt of all the foregoing within which to notify Tenant in writing that Landlord elects to: (i) other than with respect to a Permitted Transfer, terminate this Lease as to the portion of the Premises proposed to be transferred, if the portion of the Premises proposed for Transfer, together with any portion of the affected Building then subject to another Transfer, is for more than fifty percent (50%) (cumulatively, for the proposed Transfer and all other Transfers then in effect and made within the thirty six (36) month period before Tenant’s request for consideration of the proposed Transfer) of the rentable square footage of such Building, and the Transfer then under consideration is for more than seventy five percent (75%) of the remaining Lease Term (not taking into account Option Terms which have not yet commenced); (ii) permit Tenant to Transfer such space to the named transferee on the terms and conditions set forth in the notice; or (iii) refuse consent. If Landlord should fail to notify Tenant in writing of such election within the fifteen (15) day period, Landlord shall be deemed to have elected option (iii) above (i.e. refused consent); provided, however that if after such fifteen (15) day period Tenant delivers another written notice to Landlord requesting consent to the proposed Transfer together with the information required to be submitted in connection with the Transfer, such notice states that it is a second notice as to which if Landlord does not respond within seven (7) business days Landlord will be deemed to have granted its consent, and Landlord has confirmed to Tenant that Landlord received such second notice and the submitted Transfer information, then if Landlord fails to respond to Tenant within seven (7) business days after delivery of the second notice and Landlord’s confirmation of receipt Landlord shall be deemed to have consented to the proposed Transfer. In the event Landlord elects option (i) above, this Lease shall expire with respect to such part of the Premises which is the subject of the proposed Transfer on the date upon which the proposed Transfer was to commence, and from such date forward, Base Monthly Rent shall be adjusted based on the proportion that the rentable area of the Premises remaining (taking into account its allocable share of the Amenities Building square footage) bears to the total rentable area of the Premises (taking into account its allocable share of the Amenities Building Square footage) before exercise of Landlord’s election to terminate, and Tenant’s Allocable Share of all other costs and charges shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 9.E based upon the remaining rentable area of the Premises. In the event Landlord does not elect option (i) above, Landlord’s consent to the proposed Transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided and upon the condition that: (i) the proposed transferee is engaged in a business that is limited to the use expressly permitted under this Lease; (ii) the proposed transferee is a company with sufficient financial worth and management ability to undertake the financial obligation of this Lease in the case of an assignment (or in the case of a Transfer of less than all of Tenant’s interest in this Lease or a sublease, the financial obligations under such Transfer) and Landlord has been furnished with reasonable proof thereof; (iii) the proposed transfer agreement, if it is a sublease, conforms to the requirements of Section 18.I below or if it is an assignment, is in a form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; (iv) the proposed Transfer will not result in there being greater than one (1) subtenants or other occupants (not including employees) on any floor within a Building at any time during the Lease Term; (v) Tenant reimburses Landlord on demand for all reasonable costs that may be incurred by Landlord in connection with said Transfer, including the costs of making investigations as to the acceptability of the proposed transferee and legal costs incurred in connection with</p>

In the event all or any one of the foregoing conditions are not satisfied (without limiting other factors that may be considered or conditions that may be imposed by Landlord in connection with a requested Transfer), Landlord shall be considered to have acted reasonably if it withholds its consent. Tenant shall not hypothecate, mortgage, pledge or otherwise encumber Tenant’s interest in this Lease or the Premises or otherwise use the Lease as a security device in any manner without the consent of Landlord, (all of the foregoing being an “Hypothecation”) which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord on demand for any reasonable costs that may be incurred by Landlord in connection with an Hypothecation, including legal costs incurred in connection with the granting or denial of any requested consent. Landlord’s consent to one or more Transfers or Hypothecations shall not operate to waive Tenant’s obligation to obtain Landlord’s consent to other Transfers or Hypothecations nor constitute consent to an assignment or other Transfer following foreclosure of any permitted lien, mortgage or other encumbrance. If Tenant is a corporation, limited liability company, unincorporated association, partnership or other legal entity, the sale, assignment, cancellation, surrender, exchange, conversion or any other transfer or hypothecation of any stock, membership or other ownership interest in such entity (whether occurring at one time or over a period of time) in the aggregate of more than fifty percent (50%) (determined cumulatively) shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease; in the case of a partnership, any withdrawal or substitution (whether occurring at one time or over a period of time) of any partners owning fifty percent (50%) or more (cumulatively) of the partnership, or the dissolution of the partnership shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease; provided that, subject to Section 18.D below, the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall not apply to a transfer of stock in a corporation whose stock is publicly traded on a public stock exchange. If Tenant is an entity, any sale of all or substantially all of its assets shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease. If Tenant is a corporation whose stock is not publicly traded on a public stock exchange, any dissolution, merger, consolidation or reorganization of Tenant shall be deemed a Transfer. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the provision of this Section 18 are not unreasonable standards or conditions for purposes of Section 1951.4 of the California Civil Code, as amended from time to time, under bankruptcy laws, or for any other purpose.</p>

          <p id="s1p316">Assignment or Subletting Consideration:</p>
          <p id="s1p317">Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that fifty percent (50%) of any rent or other economic consideration (including without limitation, payments for trade fixtures and personal property in excess of the fair market value thereof, stock, warrants, and options) in excess of the Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder (after deducting therefrom Reasonable Transfer Costs (defined below)) (i) realized by Tenant in connection with any Transfer by Tenant, and/or (ii) realized by a subtenant or any other person or entity (other than Tenant) (any such subtenant, person or entity being a “Subsequent Transferor”) in connection with a sublease, assignment or other Transfer by such Subsequent Transferor, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord promptly after such amounts are paid to Tenant or a Subsequent Transferor, regardless of the amount of sub-rent the Subsequent Transferor pays to Tenant or any prior Subsequent Transferor. As used in this Section 18.B, “Reasonable Transfer Costs” shall mean the following costs, to the extent reasonably incurred in connection with the Transfer in question: (i) advertising costs and brokerage commissions payable to unaffiliated third parties, (ii) reasonable legal fees incurred by Tenant in connection with such Transfer, (iii) tenant improvement costs incurred by Tenant solely in connection with such Transfer, and (iv) the Unamortized TI Costs (defined below) to the extent attributable to the portion of the Premises subject to the Transfer. As used in this Lease, “Unamortized TI Costs” shall mean the then remaining (as of the date of Transfer) unamortized portion of the Work Allowance Costs to the extent not paid for through the Work Allowance, with the Work Allowance Costs not paid for through the Work Allowance being amortized over the initial one hundred forty four (144) months of the Lease Term and evenly allocated over the Deemed Buildings Square Footage. In the case of a Transfer other than an assignment of Tenant’s entire interest in the Lease and Premises, the Unamortized TI Costs shall</p>

          <p id="s1p319">be included in Reasonable Transfer Costs on a monthly amortization basis over the then remaining amortization period and shall not be fully deducted upon the occurrence of the Transfer. Tenant’s obligation to pay over Landlord’s portion of the consideration constitutes an obligation for additional rent hereunder. The above provisions relating to Landlord’s right to terminate the Lease and relating to the allocation of excess rent are independently negotiated terms of the Lease which constitute a material inducement for the Landlord to enter into the Lease, and are agreed by the Parties to be commercially reasonable. No Transfer by Tenant shall relieve it of any obligation under this Lease. Any Transfer which conflicts with the provisions of this Lease shall be voidable by Landlord at any time following such Transfer.</p>

Notwithstanding any Transfer and the acceptance of rent or other sums by Landlord from any transferee, Tenant and any guarantor shall remain fully liable for the payment of Base Monthly Rent and additional rent due, and to become due hereunder, for the performance of all the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions contained in this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed and for all acts and omissions of any transferee or any other person claiming under or through any transferee that shall be in violation of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, and any such violation shall be deemed a violation by Tenant. Tenant shall indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord and hold Landlord and the Landlord Related Parties harmless from and against all claims, liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, actions, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees) resulting from any claims that may be made against Landlord by the proposed transferee or by any real estate brokers or other persons claiming compensation in connection with the proposed Transfer.</p>

In addition, in the event that after such acquisition Tenant does not prepare audited financial statements, then in addition to the financial statements required to be delivered by Tenant hereunder, each entity required to execute the Lease Guaranty shall provide Landlord its audited financial statements at the times and in the manner required of Tenant hereunder.

Tenant may sublease all or part of the Premises or assign all of its interest in this Lease to (i) any corporation or legal entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the original Tenant to this Lease by means of an ownership interest of more than fifty percent (50%); (ii) a successor corporation or legal entity which results from a merger, consolidation or other reorganization in which Tenant is not the surviving corporation or legal entity, so long as the surviving corporation or legal entity has a net worth at the time of such assignment or sublease that is equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such transaction; and (iii) a corporation or legal entity which purchases or otherwise acquires all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Tenant so long as the surviving corporation or legal entity has a net worth at the time of such assignment or sublease that is equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such transaction.

          <p id="s1p351">Landlord grants to Tenant, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 19 two (2) options (each an “Option” and collectively the “Options”) to extend the Lease Term for an additional term (each an “Option Term”). Each Option Term shall be for a period of sixty (60) months and shall be exercised, if at all, by written notice to Landlord no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to the date the Lease Term would expire but for such exercise but no later than nine (9) months prior to the date the Lease Term would expire but for such exercise, time being of the essence for the giving of such written notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for Tenant’s exercise of an Option under this Lease to be effective, if any lease entered into by Tenant pursuant to Sections 19.E, 19.F or 19.G or any other lease entered into or assumed by Tenant for any other portion of the Project or Phase 2 (each of such other leases being an “Additional Lease”) has an expiration date that is within ten (10) months after the Expiration Date of this Lease, then the tenants under such Additional Leases must concurrently with Tenant exercise their corresponding options to extend the term of the Additional Leases if there are any remaining unexercised options under such Additional Leases. In addition, if an Additional Lease has an expiration date that is within ten (10) months before the Expiration Date of this Lease, and the tenant under such Additional Lease did not exercise an available option to extend the term of the Additional Lease, then all Options under this Lease as to which an Option Term has not commenced shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. If Tenant exercises an Option, all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease shall apply except for the grant of additional Options pursuant to this Section 19, except for Tenant’s right with respect to the lease of additional space within the Project pursuant to Sections 19.E, 19.F and 19.G below and except for tenant improvements, improvement allowances, space planning allowance or relocation allowances, free rent or other leasing concessions and inducements, and provided that Base Monthly Rent for the Premises payable by Tenant during the Option Term shall be the Fair Market Rental as hereinafter defined. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if Tenant or the tenant under any Additional Lease is in monetary or material non-monetary default beyond any applicable cure period under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease either at the time Tenant exercises the Option, or (ii) if the net worth of Tenant or the net worth or any other tenant under an Additional Lease, as reported in their most recent financial statements shows insufficient financial worth to undertake the financial obligations under this Lease or the Additional Lease, as applicable, determined in Landlord’s reasonable discretion, then Landlord shall have, in addition to all of Landlord’s other rights and remedies provided in this Lease, the right to terminate the Option upon notice to Tenant, in which event the Lease Term shall not be extended pursuant to this Section 19.A. As used herein, the term “Fair Market Rental” is defined as the rental and all other monetary payments, including any escalations and adjustments thereto (including without limitation Consumer Price Indexing) that Landlord could obtain during the Option Term from a third party desiring to lease the Premises, based upon the (i) current use and other allowed uses of the Premises, as determined by the rents then obtainable for new leases of space comparable in age and quality to the Premises in the same real estate submarket as the Building and (ii) the credit standing and financial stature of the Tenant, and taking into account the quality or condition of the Premises (but only if the Premises has been maintained and repaired by Tenant in accordance with this Lease) and tenant improvement allowances. In setting Fair Market Rental, the appraisers shall be instructed that the following concessions obtainable for new space shall not be taken into account in determining Fair Market Rental, there shall be no offset or adjustment for the following costs which Landlord will not incur in the event Tenant exercises its option, and that the appraisers’ determination shall not be discounted due to the fact that such costs will not be incurred by Landlord in connection with the Option Term: (i) brokerage commissions, (ii) relocation allowances, or (iii) vacancy costs.</p>

If Tenant does not timely send Landlord a notice as provided in the previous sentence, Tenant shall be deemed to have disagreed with Landlord’s determination of Fair Market Rental and to have elected to resolve the disagreement as provided in Section 19.C below. If Tenant elects to resolve the disagreement as provided in Section 19.C below and such procedures are not concluded prior to the commencement date of the Option Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Base Monthly Rent the Fair Market Rental as determined by Landlord in the manner provided above. If the Fair Market Rental as finally determined pursuant to Section 19.C is greater than Landlord’s determination, Tenant shall pay Landlord the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and the actual Base Monthly Rent due as so determined in this Section 19 within thirty (30) days after such determination. If the Fair Market Rental as finally determined in Section 19.C is less than Landlord’s determination, the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and the actual Base Monthly Rent due as so determined pursuant to this Section 19 shall be credited against the next installments of Base Monthly Rent due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder.</p>

If within the 30-day consultation period referred to above, Landlord and Tenant cannot reach agreement as to Fair Market Rental, each party shall select one appraiser to determine Fair Market Rental. Each such appraiser shall arrive at a determination of Fair Market Rental and submit their conclusions to Landlord and Tenant within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the 30-day consultation period described above. If only one appraisal is submitted within the requisite time period, it shall be deemed as Fair Market Rental. If both appraisals are submitted within such time period and the two (2) appraisals so submitted differ, the two (2) appraisers shall meet and see if they can come to agreement on the Fair Market Rental, and if the two (2) appraisers cannot agree then they shall immediately select a third appraiser who shall, within thirty (30) days after this selection to choose which of the appraisals made by the initial two (2) appraisers is closest to the Fair Market Rental, and such closest appraisal as determined by the third (3rd) appraiser shall be the Fair Market Rental. All appraisers specified pursuant to this Section 19.C shall be members of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers with not less than ten (10) years experience appraising office and industrial properties in the Santa Clara Valley. Each party shall pay the cost of the appraiser selected by such party and one-half of the cost of the third appraiser.</p>

Despite any other provision of this Lease, the total liability for interest payments shall not exceed the limits, if any, imposed by the usury laws of the State of California. Any interest paid in excess of those limits shall be refunded to Tenant by application of the amount of excess interest paid against any sums outstanding in any order that Landlord requires. If the amount of excess interest paid exceeds the sums outstanding, the portion exceeding those sums shall be refunded in cash to Tenant by Landlord. To ascertain whether any interest payable exceeds the limits imposed, any non-principal payment (including late charges) shall be considered to the extent permitted by law to be an expense, fee or premium rather than interest.</p>

Within seven (7) business days after Landlord’s written request, Tenant shall execute any commercially reasonable documents required by Landlord or the Holder to make this Lease subordinate to any lien of the Encumbrance. If Tenant fails to do so, then in addition to such failure constituting a default by Tenant, it shall be deemed that this Lease is so subordinated to such Encumbrance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 20.T, Tenant hereby attorns and agrees to attorn to any entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Premises at any sale or other proceeding or pursuant to the exercise of any other rights, powers or remedies under such Encumbrance. Landlord represents that the Building is not subject to any Encumbrance as of the Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the subordination of this Lease to any future Encumbrance shall be conditioned upon the delivery from any such future lenders or ground lessors of the Premises of a written agreement in commercially reasonable form which provides that in the event of termination of any such lease or upon the foreclosure of any such mortgage or deed of trust, Holder agrees to recognize Tenant’s rights under this Lease as long as Tenant is not then in default beyond applicable notice and cure periods and containing such other provisions reasonably required by Landlord or such Holder.</p>
