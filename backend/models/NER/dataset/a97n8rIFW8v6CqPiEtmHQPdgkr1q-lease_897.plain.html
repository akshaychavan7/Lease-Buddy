          <p id="s1p139">(C) NAI must serve notice of any default by BNPPLC hereunder upon any Leasehold Mortgagee for which NAI has received written notification from BNPPLC of the Leasehold Mortgagee’s address for such notice. No notice of a default by BNPPLC will be deemed effective until it is so served. Any Leasehold Mortgagee will have the right to correct or cure any such default within the same period of time after receipt of such notice as is given to BNPPLC under this Ground Lease to correct or cure defaults, plus an additional period of thirty days thereafter. NAI will accept performance by any Leasehold Mortgagee of any covenant, condition or agreement on BNPPLC’s part to be performed hereunder with the same force and effect as though performed by BNPPLC.</p>
          <p id="s1p140">(D) If this Ground Lease should terminate by reason of a disaffirmance or rejection of this Ground Lease by BNPPLC or any receiver, liquidator or trustee for the property of BNPPLC, or by any governmental authority which had taken possession of the business or property of BNPPLC by reason of the insolvency or alleged insolvency of BNPPLC, then:</p>
          <p id="s1p141">(1) NAI must give notice thereof to each Leasehold Mortgagee for which NAI has received written notification from BNPPLC of the Leasehold Mortgagee’s address for</p>
          <p id="s1p142">Ground Lease - Page 8</p>
          <p id="s1p143">such notice; and upon request of any Leasehold Mortgagee made within sixty days after NAI has given such notice, NAI must enter into a new ground lease of the Leased Property with such Leasehold Mortgagee for the remainder of the Ground Lease Term, at the same Ground Lease Rent and on the same terms and conditions (including subparagraph 11(E)) as are contained in this Ground Lease (a “ New Ground Lease”).</p>
          <p id="s1p144">(2) The estate of the Leasehold Mortgagee, as lessee under the New Ground Lease, will have priority equal to the estate of BNPPLC hereunder. That is, there will be no charge, lien or burden upon the Leased Property prior to or superior to the estate granted by such New Ground Lease which was not prior to or superior to the estate of BNPPLC under this Ground Lease as of the date immediately preceding the termination of this Ground Lease. To the extent, however, that the other Operative Documents are in effect at the time of execution of such New Ground Lease, the New Ground Lease will be made expressly subject to the other Operative Documents.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if NAI receives requests to enter into a New Ground Lease from more than one Leasehold Mortgagee because of the expiration or termination of this Ground Lease, NAI will be required to enter into only one New Ground Lease, and the New Ground Lease will be to the requesting Leasehold Mortgagee who holds the highest priority lien or interest in BNPPLC’s leasehold estate in the Land. If the liens or security interests of two or more such requesting Leasehold Mortgagees which shared the highest priority just prior to the termination of this Ground Lease, the New Ground Lease will name all such Leasehold Mortgagees as co-tenants thereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p146">(E) If BNPPLC has agreed with any Leasehold Mortgagee that such Leasehold Mortgagee’s consent will be required to any modification or early termination of this Ground Lease by BNPPLC, and if NAI has been notified in writing of such agreement, such consent will be required for such Leasehold Mortgagee to be bound by any such modification or early termination of this Ground Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">(F) No Leasehold Mortgagee will assume any liability under this Ground Lease either by virtue of its Leasehold Mortgage or by any subsequent receipt or collection of rents or profits generated from the Leased Property, unless and until the Leasehold Mortgagee acquires BNPPLC’s leasehold estate in the Leased Property at foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">(G) Although the foregoing provisions concerning Leasehold Mortgages and Leasehold Mortgagees will be self operative, NAI agrees to include, in addition to the items specified in Paragraph 9, confirmation of the foregoing with respect to any Leasehold Mortgagee or prospective Leasehold Mortgagee in any statement delivered to such Leasehold Mortgagee which is provided to a pursuant to Paragraph 9.</p>
          <p id="s1p149">Ground Lease - Page 9</p>
          <p id="s1p150">11 . NAI represents, warrants and covenants as follows: Other Representations, Warranties and Covenants of NAI</p>
          <p id="s1p151">(A) Condition of the Property. The Land described in Exhibit A is the same as the land described in the Title Policy and is shown on both the Plat and the Condominium Map, copies of which were delivered to BNPPLC at the request of NAI. Unit 4 is located as shown on the Condominium Map, and all material improvements on the Land as of the Effective Date are as shown on the Plat or the Condominium Map. There are no easements or encroachments (including Permitted Encumbrances) which extend over or within the boundaries of Unit 4. No part of Unit 4 is within a flood plain as designated by any governmental authority. Existing Improvements, if any, are free from latent or patent defects or deficiencies that, either individually or in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect the use or occupancy of the Improved Property as permitted by the Lease or could reasonably be anticipated to cause injury or death to any person. When the construction contemplated by the Construction Agreement is complete in accordance with plans approved as described therein, the Improved Property and use thereof permitted by the Lease will comply in all material respects with all Applicable Laws, including laws regarding access and use by disabled persons and local zoning ordinances. Adequate provision has been made (or can be made at a cost that is reasonable in connection with future development of the Land) for the Land to be served by electric, gas, storm and sanitary sewers, sanitary water supply, telephone and other utilities required for the use thereof. All streets, alleys and easements necessary to serve the Improved Property for the construction contemplated by the Construction Agreement or uses permitted by the Lease have been completed and are serviceable or will be completed and made serviceable as part of the construction contemplated by the Construction Agreement. No extraordinary circumstances (including any use of the Land as a habitat for endangered species) exist that would materially and adversely affect such construction or uses of the Improved Property. The Improvements, when constructed as contemplated in the Construction Agreement, will be useable for their intended purpose without the need to obtain any additional easements, rights-of-way or concessions from any third party or parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p152">(B) Environmental Representations. Except as otherwise disclosed in the Environmental Report, to the knowledge of NAI: (i) no Hazardous Substances Activity has occurred prior to the Effective Date; (ii) no owner or operator of the Improved Property has reported or been required to report any release of any Hazardous Substances on or from the Leased Property pursuant to any Environmental Law; and (iii) no owner or operator of the Leased Property has received from any federal, state or local governmental authority any warning, citation, notice of violation or other communication regarding a suspected or known release or discharge of Hazardous Substances on or from the Leased Property or regarding a suspected or known violation of Environmental Laws concerning the Leased Property. Further, NAI represents, to its knowledge, that the Environmental Report taken as a whole is not misleading or inaccurate in any material respect.</p>
          <p id="s1p153">Ground Lease - Page 10</p>
          <p id="s1p154">(C) Current Status of Title to the Land. NAI holds good and indefeasible title to the Land, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, other than the Permitted Encumbrances and any Liens Removable by BNPPLC.</p>
          <p id="s1p155">(D) Title Insurance. Without limiting NAI’s obligations under the preceding subparagraph, contemporaneously with the execution of this Ground Lease NAI must provide to BNPPLC a title insurance policy or binder committing the applicable title insurer to issue a title insurance policy, without the payment of further premiums (as the case may be, the “Title Policy”) in the amount of no less than $61,000,000, in form and substance satisfactory to BNPPLC (including comprehensive, survey, variable rate, access, and such other endorsements as may be requested by BNPPLC), written by one or more title insurance companies satisfactory to BNPPLC and insuring BNPPLC’s leasehold estate under the Ground Lease and its fee estate in the Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p156">(E) Title to Improvements. The leasehold estate created in favor of BNPPLC by this Ground Lease will extend to and include the rights to use and enjoy any and all Improvements of whatever nature at any time and from time to time located on the Land. Thus, throughout the term of this Ground Lease, BNPPLC and its sublessees, assignees, licensees and concessionaires will be entitled to use and enjoy such Improvements — to the exclusion of NAI as the lessor hereunder, but subject to NAI’s rights under the Operative Documents (including the Lease) so long as they remain in effect — as if the lessee hereunder was the owner of the Improvements. Further, although any Improvements which remain on the Land when this Ground Lease expires or is terminated will revert to NAI, it is also understood and agreed that the lessee hereunder may at any time and from time to time — after NAI ceases to have possession of the Leased Property pursuant to the Construction Agreement or as tenant under the Lease and prior to the expiration or termination of this Ground Lease — remove all or any Improvements from the Land without the consent of NAI and without any obligation to NAI or its Affiliates to provide compensation or to construct other Improvements on or about the Land. Any Improvements removed as provided in the preceding sentence will be considered severed from the Land and thereupon become personal property of the lessee hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p157">(F) Defense of Adverse Title Claims. If any encumbrance or title defect whatsoever affecting the Improved Property, other than Permitted Encumbrances or Liens Removable by BNPPLC, is claimed or discovered (including Liens against any part of or interest in the Improved Property which are not Fully Subordinated or Removable) or if any legal proceedings are instituted with respect to any such claimed or discovered encumbrance or title defect, NAI must give prompt notice thereof to BNPPLC and at NAI’s own cost and expense will promptly remove any such encumbrance and cure any such defect and will take all necessary and proper steps for the defense of any such legal proceedings, including the employment of counsel, the</p>
          <p id="s1p158">Ground Lease - Page 11</p>
          <p id="s1p159">prosecution or defense of litigation and the release or discharge of all adverse claims. If NAI fails to promptly remove any encumbrance or cure any title defect as required by the preceding sentence, BNPPLC (whether or not named as a party to legal proceedings with respect thereto) may take such additional steps as in its judgment may be necessary or proper to remove such encumbrance or cure such defect or for the defense of any such attack or legal proceedings or the protection of BNPPLC’s leasehold or other interest in the Improved Property, including the employment of counsel, the prosecution or defense of litigation, the compromise or discharge of any adverse claims made with respect to the Improved Property, the removal of prior liens or security interests, and all expenses (including Attorneys’ Fees) so incurred of every kind and character will be a demand obligation owing by NAI.</p>
          <p id="s1p160">For purposes of this subparagraph 11(B), NAI will be deemed to be acting promptly to remove any encumbrance or to cure any title defect, other than a Lien which NAI or any of its Affiliates has granted or authorized, so long as NAI is in good faith by appropriate proceedings contesting the validity and applicability of the encumbrance or defect, and pending such contest NAI will not be deemed in default under this subparagraph because of the encumbrance or defect, provided that NAI must satisfy the following conditions and requirements:</p>
          <p id="s1p161">(1) NAI must diligently prosecute the contest to completion in a manner reasonably satisfactory to BNPPLC.</p>
          <p id="s1p162">(2) NAI must immediately remove the encumbrance or cure the defect upon a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that it is valid and applicable to the Improved Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p163">(3) NAI must in any event conclude the contest and remove the encumbrance or cure the defect and pay any claims asserted against BNPPLC or the Improved Property because of such encumbrance or defect, all prior to (i) the date any criminal charges may be brought against BNPPLC or any of its directors, officers or employees because of such encumbrance or defect or (ii) the date any action is taken or threatened against BNPPLC or any property owned by BNPPLC (including BNPPLC’s leasehold estate under this Ground Lease) by any governmental authority or any other Person who has or claims rights superior to BNPPLC because of the encumbrance or defect. Also, with respect to a contest of any encumbrance or defect discovered or claimed before the Designated Sale Date, NAI must conclude the contest and remove the encumbrance or cure the defect and pay any claims asserted against BNPPLC or the Improved Property because of such encumbrance or defect, all prior to the Designated Sale Date, unless on the Designated Sale Date NAI or an Affiliate of NAI or any Applicable Purchaser purchases the Improved Property pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for a net price to BNPPLC (when taken together with any additional payments made by NAI pursuant to Paragraph 1(a)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement, in the case of a purchase by an Applicable Purchaser) equal to the Lease Balance.</p>
          <p id="s1p164">Ground Lease - Page 12</p>
          <p id="s1p165">(G) Prohibition Against Consensual Liens on the Leased Property. NAI will not, without the prior consent of BNPPLC, create, place or authorize, or through any act or failure to act, acquiesce in the placing of, any deed of trust, mortgage or other Lien, whether statutory, constitutional or contractual against or covering the Land or Improvements or any part thereof (other than Permitted Encumbrances and Liens Removable by BNPPLC). It is understood and agreed, however, that any Liens which are Fully Subordinated or Removable will constitute Permitted Encumbrances and thus will not be prohibited by this provision.</p>
          <p id="s1p166">(H) Compliance With Permitted Encumbrances. NAI must comply with and cause to be performed all of the covenants, agreements and obligations imposed upon NAI or the owner of the Leased Property by the Permitted Encumbrances.</p>
          <p id="s1p167">(I) Compliance With Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, the use of the Improved Property permitted by the Lease complies, or will comply after readily available permits are obtained, in all material respects with all Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p168">(J) Modification of Permitted Encumbrances. NAI will not enter create any new Permitted Encumbrance or enter into, initiate, approve or consent to any modification of any Permitted Encumbrance that would create or expand or purport to create or expand obligations or restrictions which would encumber the Leased Property or any Improvements constructed thereon without the prior consent of BNPPLC; provided, this provision will not limit any right of the NAI Parties to modify any Lien that is Fully Subordinated or Removable and will remain Fully Subordinated or Removable after the modification. Whether BNPPLC must give any such consent requested by NAI prior to the Designated Sale Date will be governed by subparagraph 4(C) of the Closing Certificate.</p>
          <p id="s1p169">(K) Performance and Preservation of the Permitted Encumbrances for the Benefit of BNPPLC. Not only prior to the expiration or termination of other Operative Documents, but thereafter throughout the term of this Ground Lease, NAI must comply with and perform the obligations imposed by the Permitted Encumbrances upon NAI or upon any owner of the Land and do whatever is required to preserve the rights and benefits conferred or intended to be conferred by the Permitted Encumbrances, as necessary to prevent any claim against or forfeiture of any of the Improved Property and to facilitate the construction and use of any Improvements on the Land after the Turnover Date by BNPPLC and its successors, assigns and subtenants under this Ground Lease. Further, NAI hereby agrees for itself and its Affiliates, as the owner of the Land and any other land now owned or hereafter acquired by NAI or its Affiliates, which is encumbered or benefitted by the Permitted Encumbrances, to assume liability for and to indemnify BNPPLC and other Interested Parties and to defend and hold them harmless from and against all Losses (including Losses caused by any decline in the value of the Leased Property or</p>
          <p id="s1p170">Ground Lease - Page 13</p>
          <p id="s1p171">of the Improvements) that they would not have incurred or suffered but for:</p>
          <p id="s1p172">(1) any breach by NAI of its obligations under the preceding sentence,</p>
          <p id="s1p173">(2) any termination of any benefit to the owner, users or occupants of the Land or Improvements conferred by the Permitted Encumbrances if NAI agreed to the termination or the termination resulted from a breach of any Permitted Encumbrance by NAI or its Affiliates, or</p>
          <p id="s1p174">(3) any restrictions imposed by or asserted under any Permitted Encumbrance upon any transfer after (but only after) the Turnover Date by BNPPLC of any interests it may then have in the Leased Property or in any Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p175">NAI’s obligations under this subparagraph 11(K) will be binding upon any successor or assign of NAI or its Affiliates with respect to the Land and other properties encumbered or benefitted by the Permitted Encumbrances, and such obligations will survive any sale of NAI’s interest in the Leased Property to BNPPLC because of BNPPLC’s exercise of the Contingent Purchase Option.</p>
          <p id="s1p176">(L) Cooperation by NAI and its Affiliates.</p>
          <p id="s1p177">(1) After the Turnover Date, if neither NAI nor an Applicable Purchaser has purchased BNPPLC’s interest in the Improved Property pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and if a use of the Improved Property by BNPPLC or any new Improvements or any removal or modification of Improvements proposed by BNPPLC would violate any Permitted Encumbrance or Applicable Law unless NAI or any of its Affiliates, as an owner of adjacent land or otherwise, gave its consent or approval thereto or agreed to join in a modification of a Permitted Encumbrance, then NAI must give and cause its Affiliates to give such consent or approval or join in such modification.</p>
          <p id="s1p178">(2) After the Turnover Date, if neither NAI nor an Applicable Purchaser has purchased BNPPLC’s interest in the Improved Property pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and if any Permitted Encumbrance or Applicable Law requires the consent or approval of NAI or any of its Affiliates or of the city or county in which the Improved Property is located or of any other Person to an assignment of any interest in the Improved Property by BNPPLC or by any of its successors or assigns, NAI will without charge give and cause its Affiliates to give such consent or approval and will cooperate in any way reasonably requested by BNPPLC to assist BNPPLC to obtain such consent or approval from the city, county or other Person.</p>
          <p id="s1p179">(3) NAI’s obligations under this subparagraph 11(L) will be binding upon any successor or assign of NAI or its Affiliates with respect to the Land and other properties</p>
          <p id="s1p180">Ground Lease - Page 14</p>
          <p id="s1p181">encumbered or benefitted by the Permitted Encumbrances, and such obligations will survive (a) any sale of the Improved Property by BNPPLC, other than to NAI or an Applicable Purchaser under the Purchase Agreement, for the benefit of BNPPLC’s assignees, and (b) any sale of NAI’s interest in the Leased Property to BNPPLC because of BNPPLC’s exercise of the Contingent Purchase Option.</p>
          <p id="s1p182">(M) Condominium Instruments. Without limiting the provisions the preceding subparagraphs 11(K) and 11(L), Ground Lessor agrees as follows with regard to the Condominium Declaration and other Condominium Instruments:</p>
          <p id="s1p183">(1) This Ground Lease will be superior to any and all liens granted in the Condominium Declaration, or arising to secure any obligations created by the Condominium Declaration (including judgment liens which may secure damages because of any failure of the Owner of Unit 4 to satisfy its obligations under the Condominium Instruments).</p>
          <p id="s1p184">(2) As the Owner of Unit 4, NAI will on a timely basis pay any assessments or other amounts required of the Owner of Unit 4 by the Condominium Instruments and take any other action required of the Owner of Unit 4 by the Condominium Instruments, including the filing of any new maps required by the Condominium Declaration after the completion of construction of Improvements over the land designated as Unit 4. In no even will BNPPLC be required to make any such payment or take any such action, nor will BNPPLC suffer any loss of rights or interests under this Ground Lease because of any failure of NAI to do so.</p>
          <p id="s1p185">(3) Before this Ground Lease expires or is terminated, without the prior written consent of BNPPLC in each case: (A) no rules or regulations will be imposed pursuant to the Condominium Declaration that would limit or restrict the rights which BNPPLC would enjoy under this Ground Lease or the other Operative Documents if the Condominium Declaration did not exist; (B) no amendment to any of the Condominium Instruments will be made which would terminate or limit the rights or easements appurtenant to Unit 4 thereunder or expand the obligations of any owner or occupant of the Land thereunder; (C) no liens will be granted or permitted against the Common Elements unless they are expressly subject and subordinate to (i) the rights and easements appurtenant to Unit 4 under the Condominium Declaration, and (ii) the rights and interests of BNPPLC under this Ground Lease and the other Operative Documents; (D) the rights of the Declarant under the Condominium Declaration will not be transferred to anyone other than the Owner of Unit 4; and (D) no conveyance of the fee estate in Unit 4 will be made without a transfer of all rights of the Declarant to the same transferee ( i.e., the new Owner of Unit 4). Further, until this Ground Lease expires or is terminated, this Ground Lease and the other Operative Documents will control in the event of any</p>
          <p id="s1p186">Ground Lease - Page 15</p>
          <p id="s1p187">conflict between the Condominium Declaration and the terms and conditions of this Ground Lease or the other Operative Documents.</p>
          <p id="s1p188">(4) After the Turnover Date: (a) BNPPLC will be entitled to attend and receive notice of any meeting the Owners required or permitted by the Condominium Instruments, and BNPPLC will be entitled to cast a vote in any vote of the Owners required or permitted by the Condominium Instruments, as if BNPPLC were the Owner of Unit 4. (b) Further, if the Owner of Unit 4 breaches any obligations imposed upon it by the Condominium Instruments, BNPPLC will have the right to receive notice of such breach and the right, but not the obligation, to cure such breach, as if BNPPLC itself were the Owner of Unit 4. (c) Also, the rights of BNPPLC and its invitees to use parking and driveways within the Additional Leased Premises (as defined in Exhibit A) will be superior to the rights granted to others by the Condominium Declaration; and BNPPLC may, as it from time to time deems necessary, identify any or all parking areas within the Additional Leased Premises as “reserved” or take other reasonable steps to assure preferred access to such parking by occupants of the Improvements which comprise Unit 4.</p>
          <p id="s1p189">(5) BNPPLC will not be restricted or limited by anything in the Condominium Instruments in the demolition, construction, alteration repair, replacement, use or operation of Improvements. Further, BNPPLC will not be required by reason of the Condominium Instruments to obtain any consent or approval for any such demolition, construction, alteration, use or operation or for any related submissions (including site plans) to Wake County or other governmental authorities.</p>
          <p id="s1p190">(6) The rights of BNPPLC under this Ground Lease or any other Operative Documents to control and to receive and retain or apply insurance or condemnation proceeds with respect to the Property will control over any conflicting provisions of the Condominium Instruments.</p>
          <p id="s1p191">(7) BNPPLC will not be bound by or required to participate in any arbitration by reason of any arbitration provisions or other provisions in the Condominium Instruments.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">The agreements of NAI in this subparagraph 11(M) are made by NAI, not only as the current owner of the Ground Leased Premises (as defined in Exhibit A), but also as the current Owner of all Units created by the Condominium Declaration, and with the understanding that all of such agreements will be binding upon all future Owners so long as this Ground Lease remains in force.</p>
          <p id="s1p193">(N) Omissions. None of NAI’s representations or warranties contained in this Ground</p>
          <p id="s1p194">Ground Lease - Page 16</p>
          <p id="s1p195">Lease or in any other document, certificate or written statement furnished to BNPPLC by or on behalf of NAI contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein (when taken in their entireties) not misleading.</p>
          <p id="s1p196">(O) Insurance and Casualty. In the event any of the Leased Property is destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, windstorm, hail or by any other casualty against which insurance is maintained or required hereunder, (i) BNPPLC may make proof of loss, (ii) each insurance company concerned is hereby authorized and directed to make payment for such loss directly to BNPPLC for application as required by Paragraph 4, and (iii) BNPPLC’s consent must be obtained for any settlement, adjustment or compromise of any claims for loss, damage or destruction under any policy or policies of insurance.</p>
          <p id="s1p197">(P) Condemnation. All proceeds of condemnation awards or proceeds of sale in lieu of condemnation with respect to the Leased Property and all judgments, decrees and awards for injury or damage to the Leased Property will be paid to BNPPLC and applied as provided in Paragraph 4 above. BNPPLC is hereby authorized, in the name of NAI, to execute and deliver valid acquittances for, and to appeal from, any such judgment, decree or award concerning condemnation of any of the Leased Property. BNPPLC will not be, in any event or circumstances, liable or responsible for failure to collect, or to exercise diligence in the collection of, any such proceeds, judgments, decrees or awards.</p>
          <p id="s1p198">(Q) Further Assurances. NAI must, on request of BNPPLC, (i) promptly correct any defect, error or omission which may be discovered in the contents of this Ground Lease or in any other instrument executed in connection herewith or in the execution or acknowledgment thereof; (ii) execute, acknowledge, deliver and record or file such further instruments and do such further acts as may be necessary, desirable or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Ground Lease and to subject to this Ground Lease any property intended by the terms hereof to be covered hereby including specifically, but without limitation, any renewals, additions, substitutions, replacements or appurtenances to the Leased Property; (iii) execute, acknowledge, deliver, procure and record or file any document or instrument deemed advisable by BNPPLC to protect BNPPLC’s rights in and to the Leased Property against the rights or interests of third persons; and (iv) provide such certificates, documents, reports, information, affidavits and other instruments and do such further acts as may be necessary, desirable or proper in the reasonable determination of BNPPLC to enable BNPPLC or any Leasehold Mortgagee to comply with the requirements or requests of any agency or authority having jurisdiction over them.</p>
          <p id="s1p199">12 . Ground Lease Defaults</p>
          <p id="s1p200">(A) Definition of Ground Lease Default. Each of the following events will be deemed</p>
          <p id="s1p201">Ground Lease - Page 17</p>
          <p id="s1p202">to be a “ Ground Lease Default” by BNPPLC under this Ground Lease:</p>
          <p id="s1p203">(1) A failure by BNPPLC to pay when due any installment of Ground Lease Rent due hereunder if such failure continues for sixty days after BNPPLC receives notice thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p204">(2) A failure by BNPPLC to comply with any term, provision or covenant of this Ground Lease (other than as described in the other clauses of this subparagraph 13(A)) if such failure is not cured prior to the earlier of (A) ninety days after notice thereof is sent to BNPPLC, or (B) the date any writ or order is issued for the levy or sale of any property owned by NAI or its Affiliates (including the leasehold created by this Ground Lease) because of such failure or any criminal action is instituted against BNPPLC or any of its directors, officers or employees because of such failure; provided, however, that so long as no such writ or order is issued and no such criminal actions is instituted, if such failure is susceptible of cure but cannot with reasonable diligence be cured within such ninety day period, and if BNPPLC has promptly commenced to cure the same and thereafter prosecutes the curing thereof with reasonable diligence, the period within which such failure may be cured will be extended for such further period as is necessary to complete the cure.</p>
          <p id="s1p205">(B) Remedy. Upon the occurrence of a Ground Lease Default which is not cured within any applicable period expressly permitted by subparagraph 13(A), NAI’s sole and exclusive remedies will be to sue BNPPLC for the collection of any amount due under this Ground Lease, to sue for the specific enforcement of BNPPLC’s obligations hereunder, or to enjoin the continuation of the Ground Lease Default, provided, however, no limitation of NAI’s remedies contained herein will prevent NAI from exercising rights expressly provided in other Operative Documents or from recovering any reasonable costs NAI may incur to mitigate its damages by curing a Ground Lease Default that BNPPLC has failed to cure itself (so long as the cure by NAI is pursued in a lawful manner and the costs NAI seeks to recover do not exceed the actual damages to be mitigated). NAI may not terminate this Ground Lease or BNPPLC’s right to possession under this Ground Lease, except as expressly provided in the Operative Documents. Any judgment which NAI may obtain against BNPPLC for amounts due under this Ground Lease may be collected only through resort of a judgement lien against BNPPLC’s interest in the Leased Property and any Improvements.

          <p id="s1p271">As used in this Exhibit:</p>
          <p id="s1p272">(1) “ Additional Leased Premises” means the land surrounding and adjacent to Unit 4, depicted on the site plan attached to and made a part of this Exhibit as the area shaded in gray, which includes parking lots, driveways and other areas within the larger area designated as Common Elements in the Condominium Declaration.

All land within those outer boundaries, other than Unit 4, is included in the Additional Leased Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p273">(2) “ Condominium Declaration” means the Declaration of Condominium for NetApp RTP Phase I Condominium recorded in Book 012647, Page 01310, Wake County, North Carolina Registry.</p>
          <p id="s1p274">(3) “ Condominium Map” means the plat provided to BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (“BNPPLC”) by Network Appliance, Inc. (“NAI”) attached to and made a part of this Exhibit. (The Condominium Map has also been filed in the Book of Maps CM2007, Page 444A1, Wake County, North Carolina Registry.)</p>
          <p id="s1p275">(4) “ Unit 4” means the land designated and described in the Condominium Declaration as Unit 4 and is shown on the Condominium Map and site plan attached to and made a part of this Exhibit.</p>
          <p id="s1p276">TOGETHER WITH, easements appurtenant to the Ground Lease Premises (the “ Appurtenant Easements”) under, over and across adjacent parcels (“Adjacent Parcels”) which are owned by NAI or the Association (as defined in the Condominium Declaration) for the purposes described below and on and subject to the express terms and conditions set forth below;</p>

          <p id="s1p278">Association for the purposes described below and on and subject to the express terms and conditions set forth below.</p>
          <p id="s1p279">The Appurtenant Easements will be for the following purposes:</p>
          <p id="s1p280">1. The construction (including expansion or replacement), use, maintenance and repair of utility lines under, over and across the Adjacent Parcels and related equipment (including lines or equipment for water, sanitary sewer, electricity, phone and gas) (collectively, the “ Utility Lines”) to serve improvements constructed from time to time on the Ground Lease Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p281">2. Access and parking over and in paved driveways and parking lots or garages now or hereafter located on the Adjacent Parcels (“ Driveways and Parking Areas”).</p>
          <p id="s1p282">3. The encroachment, support, maintenance, repair and replacement of any buildings constructed on Unit 4 as shown on the Condominium Map during the period that BNPPLC owns or leases Unit 4.</p>
          <p id="s1p283">The Appurtenant Easements will be subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
          <p id="s1p284">A. The Appurtenant Easements for Utility Lines will be limited to:</p>
          <p id="s1p285">(1) those Utility Lines, if any, existing on the first date upon which any instrument is recorded which gives notice of the Appurtenant Easements;</p>
          <p id="s1p286">(2) those Utility Lines, if any, constructed by or at the request of NAI itself;</p>
          <p id="s1p287">(3) any other Utility Lines reasonably necessary for the use of improvements constructed or expected to be constructed as provided in the Construction Agreement dated as of the date of this Ground Lease between NAI and BNPPLC (whether constructed for BNPPLC or otherwise) (and in the case of Utility Lines permitted only because of this clause (3), such Utility Lines must be installed in a location that does not run through or under any then existing building or structured garage on the Adjacent Parcels); and</p>
          <p id="s1p288">(4) replacements (including replacements that may increase utility capacity) for any Utility Lines permitted under the preceding clauses (1) through (3).</p>
          <p id="s1p289">B. Any Utility Line on any Adjacent Parcel may be relocated to another</p>
          <p id="s1p290">Exhibit A to Ground Lease - Page 2</p>
          <p id="s1p291">location on the same Adjacent Parcel by the owner of such parcel and at its sole cost and expense, so long as the relocation is done in a good and workmanlike manner that does not and will not impose any significant or unexpected interruption of utility services or additional costs upon the owner or occupants of the Ground Lease Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p292">C. The use of Driveways and Parking Areas by the owner of the Ground Lease Premises and its tenants and other invitees will not exceed that reasonably required to provide buildings constructed on the Ground Lease Premises with parking that both (i) meets local zoning and other legal requirements, and (ii) when taken together with any permanent, concrete parking spaces from time to time constructed on the Ground Lease Premises, causes the Parking Ratio (as defined below) for building(s) constructed upon Unit 4 to equal the average Parking Ratio for all buildings constructed upon all Units created by the Condominium Declaration (collectively, the “ Parking Requirements”). As used in the preceding sentence, “Parking Ratio” means, for any building, the percentage computed by dividing of the number of parking spaces on the Additional Leased Premises or on the Adjacent Tracts which are available to the occupants of such building, divided by the useable square footage of such building.</p>
          <p id="s1p293">D. NAI and its successors and assigns as the owners of Adjacent Parcels will always maintain a number of parking spaces on the Adjacent Parcels which is no less than the sum of (1) the spaces required to meet Parking Requirements for buildings on the Ground Lease Premises, and (2) the spaces required to satisfy zoning or other parking requirements for other buildings on or served by parking on the Adjacent Parcels.</p>
          <p id="s1p294">The Reserved Easement will be for the following purposes:</p>
          <p id="s1p295">1. The construction (including expansion and replacement), use, maintenance and repair of any structured parking garage on any portion of the Additional Leased Premises (but not any part of Unit 4) and related equipment (including lines or equipment for electricity) (collectively, a “ Structured Garage”) as deemed necessary or helpful by the Association to serve improvements constructed from time to time on both Unit 4 and any one or more other Units (as defined in the Condominium Declaration) designated by the Association prior to the construction of the Structured Garage (whether one or more, the “Other Units”); and</p>
          <p id="s1p296">2. Access across paved driveways now or hereafter located on the Additional Leased Premises, including access to loading docks which serve and are part of the building designated as “Building 3” on the Condominium Map.</p>
          <p id="s1p297">The Reserved Easement will be subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
          <p id="s1p298">A. The construction (including expansion or replacement) of any Structured</p>
          <p id="s1p299">Exhibit A to Ground Lease - Page 3</p>
          <p id="s1p300">Garage will be not exceed the size or scope required, as proposed in good faith by the Association and approved by Ground Lessee (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld), to provide Unit 4 and Other Units with parking that both (i) meets local zoning and other legal requirements, and (ii) when taken together with any permanent, concrete parking spaces from time to time constructed and available for use on the Adjacent Tracts, is sufficient to meet the reasonable projected parking needs of the owners and occupants of Unit 4 and the Other Units (collectively, the “ Association’s Proposed Parking Requirements”). If, however, the Association does propose, and the tenant under this Ground Lease does approve, the construction of a Structured Garage to meet the Association’s Proposed Parking Requirements, then the Association may undertake such construction pursuant to the Reserved Easement; and in the case of any such construction commenced after the Turnover Date, the Ground Lessee must join with the owners of Other Units to reimburse to the Association all actual, out-of-pocket costs of design and construction in accordance with a schedule of reimbursements imposed by the Association to facilitate the construction.</p>
          <p id="s1p301">B. Before the Turnover Date, Ground Lessee will have no obligation for any such reimbursements to the Association. After the Turnover Date, such reimbursements will be allocated among the Ground Lessee and each owner of Other Units in proportion to the square footage of their respective buildings to be served by the Structured Garage; subject, however, to any reasonable determination of the Association that (1) some other allocation of the cost would be more equitable, (2) is made before construction commences and contemporaneously with the Association’s determination that construction of a Structured Garage is required to meet the Association’s Proposed Parking Requirements, and (3) is made at a time when none of the parties affected by such determination has voting control of the Association.</p>
          <p id="s1p302">B. Prior to the Turnover Date, Ground Lessee will have no obligation to pay or reimburse the costs of operating or maintaining any Structured Garage. However, after the Turnover Date and construction of any Structured Garage by the Association, the cost of operating and maintaining it (including property taxes) will be allocated among the Ground Lessee and the owners of Other Units in the same proportion as the original costs of construction pursuant to the preceding paragraph.</p>
          <p id="s1p303">C. The Reserved Easement will not preclude any construction by the Ground Lessee, at its own expense, of any Structured Garage on the Additional Leased Premises if ever the Ground Lessee itself should determine that a Structured Garage is needed to meet the parking needs of the occupants of Unit 4.</p>

          <p id="s1p341">Exhibit B to Ground Lease - Page 2</p>
          <p id="s1p342">Exhibit C</p>
          <p id="s1p343">CONTINGENT PURCHASE OPTION</p>
          <p id="s1p344">Subject to the terms of this Exhibit, BNPPLC shall have an option (the “ Option”) to buy NAI’ fee interest in the Leased Property at any time during the term of this Ground Lease after (but only after) any breach by NAI under the Purchase Agreement, provided NAI does not cure the breach within any time permitted for cure by the express provisions of the Purchase Agreement, for a purchase price (the “Option Price”) to NAI equal to fair market value.</p>
          <p id="s1p345">For the purposes of this Exhibit, “fair market value” means (and all appraisers and other persons involved in the determination of the Option Price will be so advised) the price that would be agreed upon between a willing buyer, under no compulsion to buy, and a willing seller, under no compulsion to sell, for unimproved land comparable in size and location to the Land, exclusive of any Improvements but assuming that there is no higher and better use for such land than as a site for improvements of comparable size and utility to the Improvements, at the time of BNPPLC’s exercise of the Option and taking into consideration the condition of the Land, the encumbrances affecting the title to the Land and all applicable zoning, land use approvals and other governmental permits relating to the Land at the time of the exercise of the Option.</p>
          <p id="s1p346">If BNPPLC exercises the Option, which BNPPLC may do by notifying NAI that BNPPLC has elected to buy NAI’ interest in the Leased Property as provided herein, then:</p>
          <p id="s1p347">(1) To the extent, if any, required as a condition imposed by law to the conveyance of the fee interest in the Leased Property to BNPPLC, NAI shall promptly at its expense do whatever is necessary and possible (including, without limitation, cooperating with BNPPLC in seeking any zoning variances requested by BNPPLC) to obtain approvals of a new recorded plat or lot line adjustments. Should it be determined that it is not possible to satisfy any such condition imposed by law, neither NAI nor BNPPLC shall be required to consummate any purchase pursuant to this Exhibit, and this Ground Lease will continue as if BNPPLC had not exercised the Option.</p>
          <p id="s1p348">(2) Upon BNPPLC’s tender of the Option Price to NAI, NAI will convey good and indefeasible title to the fee estate in the Land and its interest in all other Leased Property to BNPPLC by general warranty deed and assignment subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances, to any claims of BNPPLC or Liens Removable by BNPPLC, and (to the extent still in force) to the Lease and the Purchase Agreement.</p>
          <p id="s1p349">(3) BNPPLC’s obligation to close the purchase shall be subject to the following terms and conditions, all of which are for the benefit of BNPPLC: (a) BNPPLC shall have been furnished with evidence satisfactory to BNPPLC that NAI can convey title as required by the preceding subparagraph; (b) nothing shall have occurred or been discovered after BNPPLC exercised the Option that could significantly and adversely affect title to the Leased Property or BNPPLC’s use thereof, (c) all of the</p>
          <p id="s1p350">representations of NAI in this Ground Lease shall continue to be true as if made effective on the date of the closing and, with respect to any such representations which may be limited to the knowledge of NAI or any of NAI’ representatives, would continue to be true on the date of the closing if all relevant facts and circumstances were known to NAI and such representatives, and (d) BNPPLC shall have been tendered the deed and other documents which are described in this Exhibit as documents to be delivered to BNPPLC at the closing of BNPPLC’s purchase.</p>
          <p id="s1p351">(4) Closing of the purchase will be scheduled on the first Business Day following thirty days after the Option Price is established in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Exhibit and after any approvals described in subparagraph (1) above are obtained, and prior to closing BNPPLC’s occupancy of the Leased Property shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Ground Lease, including the terms setting forth BNPPLC’s obligation to pay rent. Closing shall take place at the offices of any title insurance company reasonably selected by BNPPLC to insure title under the title insurance policy described below.</p>
          <p id="s1p352">(5) Any transfer taxes or notices or registrations required by law in connection with the sale contemplated by this Exhibit will be the responsibility of NAI.</p>
          <p id="s1p353">(6) NAI will deliver a certificate of nonforeign status to BNPPLC at closing as needed to comply with the provisions of the U.S. Foreign Investors Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA) or any comparable federal, state or local law in effect at the time.</p>
          <p id="s1p354">(7) NAI will also pay for and deliver to BNPPLC at the closing an owner’s title insurance policy in the full amount of the Option Price, issued by a title insurance company designated by BNPPLC (or written confirmation from the title company that it is then prepared to issue such a policy), and subject only to standard printed exceptions which the title insurance company refuses to delete or modify in a manner acceptable to BNPPLC and to Permitted Encumbrances.</p>
          <p id="s1p355">(8) NAI shall also deliver at the closing all other documents or things reasonably required to be delivered to BNPPLC or by the title insurance company to evidence NAI’ ability to transfer the Leased Property to BNPPLC.</p>
          <p id="s1p356">If NAI and BNPPLC do not otherwise agree upon the amount of the Option Price within twenty days after BNPPLC exercises the Option, the Option Price shall be determined in accordance with the following procedure:</p>
          <p id="s1p357">(a) NAI and BNPPLC shall each appoint a real estate appraiser who is familiar with properties in the vicinity of the Land and who has not previously acted for either party. Each party will make the appointment no later than ten</p>
          <p id="s1p358">Exhibit C to Ground Lease - Page 2</p>
          <p id="s1p359">days after receipt of notice from the other party that the appraisal process described in this Exhibit has been invoked. The agreement of the two appraisers as to the Option Price will be binding upon NAI and BNPPLC. If the two appraisers cannot agree upon the Option Price within ten days following their appointment, they shall within another ten days agree upon a third real estate appraiser. Immediately thereafter, each of the first two appraisers will submit his best estimate of the appropriate Option Price (together with a written report supporting such estimate) to the third appraiser and the third appraiser will choose between the two estimates. The estimate of Option Price chosen by the third appraiser as the closest to the prevailing monthly fair market value will be binding upon NAI and BNPPLC. Notification in writing of the Option Price shall be made to NAI and BNPPLC within fifteen days following the selection of the third appraiser.</p>
          <p id="s1p360">(b) If appraisers must be selected under the procedure set out above and either BNPPLC or NAI fails to appoint an appraiser or fails to notify the other party of such appointment within fifteen days after receipt of notice that the prescribed time for appointing the appraisers has passed, then the other party’s appraiser will determine the Option Price. All appraisers selected for the appraisal process set out in this Exhibit will be disinterested, reputable, qualified real estate appraisers with the designation of MAI or equivalent and with at least 5 years experience in appraising properties comparable to the Land.</p>
          <p id="s1p361">(c) If a third appraiser must be chosen under the procedure set out above, he will be chosen on the basis of objectivity and competence, not on the basis of his relationship with the other appraisers or the parties to this Ground Lease, and the first two appraisers will be so advised. Although the first two appraisers will be instructed to attempt in good faith to agree upon the third appraiser, if for any reason they cannot agree within the prescribed time, either NAI and BNPPLC may require the first two appraisers to immediately submit its top choice for the third appraiser to the then highest ranking officer of the Dallas, Texas Bar Association who will agree to help and who has no attorney/client or other significant relationship to either NAI or BNPPLC. Such officer will have complete discretion to select the most objective and competent third appraiser from between the choice of each of the first two appraisers, and will do so within ten days after such choices are submitted to him.</p>
          <p id="s1p362">(d) Either NAI or BNPPLC may notify the appraiser selected by the other party to demand the submission of an estimate of Option Price or a choice of a third appraiser as required under the procedure described above; and if the submission of such an estimate or choice is required but the other party’s appraiser fails to comply with the demand within fifteen days after receipt of such</p>
          <p id="s1p363">Exhibit C to Ground Lease - Page 3</p>
          <p id="s1p364">notice, then the Option Price or choice of the third appraiser, as the case may be, selected by the other appraiser (i.e., the notifying party’s appraiser) will be binding upon NAI and BNPPLC.</p>
          <p id="s1p365">(e) NAI and BNPPLC shall each bear the expense of the appraiser appointed by it, and the expense of the third appraiser and of any officer of the Dallas, Texas Bar Association who participates in the appraisal process described above will be shared equally by NAI and BNPPLC.</p>
          <p id="s1p366">Exhibit C to Ground Lease - Page 4</p>
          <p id="s1p367">Exhibit D</p>
          <p id="s1p368">DETERMINATION OF FAIR RENTAL VALUE</p>
          <p id="s1p369">Each annual payment of Ground Lease Rent will equal the Fair Rental Value, computed as of the most recent Rental Determination Date when such payment becomes due. As used in this Exhibit, “ Rental Determination Date” means the (1) the Effective Date, (2) the earliest anniversary of the Effective Date to follow the Turnover Date by more than thirty days, and (3) after the second Rental Determination Date described in clause (2), each fifth anniversary of the preceding Rental Determination Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p370">As of the Effective Date ( i.e., the first Rental Determination Date), the parties have agreed that Fair Rental Value is the dollar amount set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Ground Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p371">If NAI and BNPPLC have not agreed upon Fair Rental Value as of any subsequent Rental Determination Date within one hundred eighty days after the such date, then Fair Rental Value will be determined as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p372">(a) NAI and BNPPLC shall each appoint a real estate appraiser who is familiar with rental values for properties in the vicinity of the Land and who has not previously acted for either party. Each party will make the appointment no later than ten days after receipt of notice from the other party that the appraisal process described in this Exhibit has been invoked. The agreement of the two appraisers as to Fair Rental Value will be binding upon NAI and BNPPLC.

          <p id="s1p373">(b) If appraisers must be selected under the procedure set out above and either BNPPLC or NAI fails to appoint an appraiser or fails to notify the other party of such appointment within fifteen days after receipt of notice that the prescribed time for appointing the appraisers has passed, then the other party’s appraiser will determine the Fair Rental Value.
