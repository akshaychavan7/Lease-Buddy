          <p id="s1p25">WHEREAS, in recognition of their common goal to maintain the financial soundness of Heritage Commerce Corp, San Jose, California (“Heritage”), a registered bank holding company, and its subsidiary bank, Heritage Bank of Commerce, San Jose, California (the “Bank”), a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, Heritage, the Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the “Reserve Bank”), and the State of California Department of Financial Institutions (the “Department”) have mutually agreed to enter into this Written Agreement (the “Agreement”); and</p>
          <p id="s1p26">1</p>
          <p id="s1p27">WHEREAS, on February 17, 2010, Heritage’s and the Bank’s boards of directors, at duly constituted meetings, adopted resolutions authorizing and directing Walter Kaczmarek and Walter Kaczmarek to consent to this Agreement on behalf of Heritage and the Bank, respectively, and consenting to compliance with each and every applicable provision of this Agreement by Heritage, the Bank, and their institution-affiliated parties, as defined in sections 3(u) and 8(b)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the “FDI Act”) (12 U.S.C. §§ 1813(u) and 1818(b)(3)).</p>
          <p id="s1p28">NOW, THEREFORE, Heritage, the Bank, the Reserve Bank, and the Department agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p29">Source of Strength</p>
          <p id="s1p30">1. The board of directors of Heritage shall take appropriate steps to fully utilize Heritage’s financial and managerial resources, pursuant to section 225.4(a) of Regulation Y of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board of Governors”) (12 C.F.R. § 225.4(a)), to ensure that the Bank complies with this Agreement and any other supervisory action taken by the Bank’s federal regulators or the Department.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">Credit Risk Management</p>
          <p id="s1p32">2. Within 60 days of this Agreement, the Bank shall submit to the Reserve Bank and the Department an acceptable written plan to strengthen credit risk management practices. The plan shall, at a minimum, address, consider, and include:</p>
          <p id="s1p33">(a) Procedures to limit and manage concentrations of credit that are consistent with the Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices, dated December 12, 2006 (SR 07-1);</p>
          <p id="s1p34">2</p>

          <p id="s1p38">3. The Bank shall not, directly or indirectly, extend, renew, or restructure any credit to or for the benefit of any borrower, including any related interest of the borrower, whose loans or other extensions of credit are criticized in the report of the examination of the Bank conducted by the Reserve Bank that commenced on August 17, 2009 (the “Report of Examination”) or in any subsequent report of examination, without the prior approval of a majority of the full board of directors or a designated committee thereof. The board of directors or its committee shall document in writing the reasons for the extension of credit, renewal, or restructuring, specifically certifying that: (i) the Bank’s risk management policies and practices for loan workout activity are acceptable; (ii) the extension of credit is necessary to improve and protect the Bank’s interest in the ultimate collection of the credit already granted and maximize its potential for collection; (iii) the extension of credit reflects prudent underwriting based on reasonable repayment terms and is adequately secured; and all necessary loan documentation has been properly and accurately prepared and filed; (iv) the Bank has performed a comprehensive credit analysis indicating that the borrower has the willingness and ability to repay the debt as supported by an adequate workout plan, as necessary; and (v) the board of directors or its designated committee reasonably believes that the extension of credit will not impair the Bank’s interest in obtaining repayment of the already outstanding credit and that the extension of credit or renewal will be repaid according to its terms. The written certification shall be made a part of the minutes of the</p>
          <p id="s1p39">3</p>
          <p id="s1p40">meetings of the board of directors or its committee, as appropriate, and a copy of the signed certification, together with the credit analysis and related information that was used in the determination, shall be retained by the Bank in the borrower’s credit file for subsequent supervisory review. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “related interest” is defined as set forth in section 215.2(n) of Regulation O of the Board of Governors (12 C.F.R. § 215.2(n)).</p>
          <p id="s1p41">4. (a) Within 60 days of this Agreement, the Bank shall submit to the Reserve Bank and the Department an acceptable written plan designed to improve the Bank’s position through repayment, amortization, liquidation, additional collateral, or other means on each loan or other asset in excess of $2 million, including other real estate owned (“OREO”), that (i) is past due as to principal or interest more than 90 days as of the date of this Agreement; (ii) is on the Bank’s problem loan list; or (iii) was adversely classified in the Report of Examination. In developing the plan for each loan, the Bank shall, at a minimum, review, analyze, and document the financial position of the borrower, including source of repayment, repayment ability, and alternative repayment sources, as well as the value and accessibility of any pledged or assigned collateral, and any possible actions to improve the Bank’s collateral position.</p>

          <p id="s1p48">(b) The Bank shall maintain a sound process for determining, documenting, and recording an adequate ALLL in accordance with regulatory reporting instructions and relevant supervisory guidance, including the Interagency Policy Statements on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, dated July 2, 2001 (SR 01-17 (Sup)) and December 13, 2006 (SR 06-17).</p>

The program shall include policies and procedures to ensure adherence to the ALLL methodology and provide for periodic reviews and updates to the ALLL methodology, as appropriate.

Any deficiency found in the ALLL shall be remedied in the quarter it is discovered, prior to the filing of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, by additional provisions. The board of directors shall maintain written documentation of its review, including the factors considered and conclusions reached by the Bank in determining the adequacy of the ALLL. During the term of this Agreement, the Bank shall submit to the Reserve</p>

          <p id="s1p53">6. Within 60 days of this Agreement, Heritage and the Bank shall submit to the Reserve Bank and the Department an acceptable joint written plan to maintain sufficient capital at Heritage on a consolidated basis, and the Bank as a separate legal entity on a stand-alone basis. The plan shall, at a minimum, address, consider, and include:</p>
