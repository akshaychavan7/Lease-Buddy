          <p id="s1p894">This schedule provides the details of the Development Program, revised from that which was submitted as part of Elmworth's Development Plan dated June 24 2008. The first table is an updated Table 1-1 which outlines the minimum work required prior to specific deadlines. This table has been revised for prevailing economic and operational conditions. The second is a schedule of estimated annual capital expenditures.</p>
          <p id="s1p895">The total well count of ten has not changed from the Development Plan as originally submitted. Three of those wells had already been drilled prior to the effective date, during the period in which the Development Plan was being approved by the Department of Energy, leaving seven wells to be drilled within the first five years of the lease. The change from Elmworth's original submission is the need for an additional year to drill the remaining Kennetcook wells, and two additional years for the remaining outlying wells.</p>
          <p id="s1p896">Two more wells will be drilled in the Kennetcook area before the second anniversary of the lease or the end of Phase I, approximately March 2011, and the remaining 5 wells will be drilled in the outlying areas before the 5th anniversary, or end of Phase II, approximately March 2014.</p>
          <p id="s1p897">If wells are drilled sooner than outlined in the schedule, they will count towards the final tally of wells required under this program.</p>
