          <p id="s1p239">(d) all easements, development rights and other rights appurtenant to the Land or the Leased Improvements; and</p>

SS 3 but for its removal from navigation for use in gaming or other business operations and/or any modifications made thereto to facilitate dockside gaming or other business operations, and, in each case, all appurtenances thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p241">The Leased Property is leased subject to all covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements and other matters of any nature affecting the Leased Property or any portion thereof as of the Commencement Date and such subsequent covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements and other matters as may hereafter arise in accordance with the terms of this Lease or as may otherwise be agreed to in writing by Landlord and Tenant, whether or not of record, including any matters which would be disclosed by an inspection or accurate survey of the Leased Property or any portion thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p242">Except as more specifically provided in the following paragraph, to the extent Landlords ownership of any Leased Property or any portion thereof (including any improvement (including any Capital Improvement) or other property) that does not constitute real property within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.856-3(d), which would otherwise be owned by Landlord and leased to Tenant pursuant to this Lease, could cause Landlord REIT to fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust (within the meaning of Section 856(a) of the Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto), then a portion of such property shall automatically instead be owned by Propco TRS LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is a taxable REIT subsidiary (within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto) of Landlord REIT (the Propco TRS), to the extent necessary such that Landlords ownership of such Leased Property does not cause Landlord REIT to fail to</p>
          <p id="s1p243">2</p>
          <p id="s1p244">qualify as a real estate investment trust, provided, there shall be no adjustment in the Rent as a result of the foregoing. In such event, Landlord shall cause the Propco TRS to make such property available to Tenant in accordance with the terms hereof; however, Landlord shall remain fully liable for all obligations of Landlord under this Lease and shall retain sole decision-making authority for any matters for which Landlords consent or approval is required or permitted to be given and for which Landlords discretion may be exercised under this Lease. The terms and conditions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to the casino at the Southern Indiana Leased Property, which shall be governed by, among other things, the following paragraph and the final paragraph of the definition of Rent set forth in Section 1.2 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p245">Furthermore, Tenant acknowledges that the casino at the Southern Indiana Leased Property is currently located on a barge which Tenant intends to relocate in the near future to a portion of the Leased Property currently consisting of vacant land adjacent to the hotel located at such Leased Property. In the event that an Accountant mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant determines at any time that the relative values of the portions of the Southern Indiana Leased Property that constitute real property within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.856-3(d) on the one hand, and the portions that do not constitute real property on the other hand, could reasonably be expected to cause Landlord REIT to fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust (within the meaning of Section 856(a) of the Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto), the minimum portion of assets of the Southern Indiana Leased Property necessary to rectify such failure shall automatically instead be owned by a taxable REIT subsidiary (within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto) that owns solely such assets (Southern Indiana Barge TRS) and, in such event, Landlord shall cause the Southern Indiana Barge TRS to make such property available to Tenant in accordance with the terms hereof; however, Landlord shall remain fully liable for all obligations of Landlord under this Lease and shall retain sole decision-making authority for any matters for which Landlords consent or approval is required or permitted to be given and for which Landlords discretion may be exercised under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p246">1.2 Single, Indivisible Leas. This Lease constitutes one indivisible lease of the Leased Property and not separate leases governed by similar terms. The Leased Property constitutes one economic unit, and the Rent and all other provisions have been negotiated and agreed upon based on a demise of all of the Leased Property to Tenant as a single, composite, inseparable transaction and would have been substantially different had separate leases or a divisible lease been intended. Except as expressly provided in this Lease for specific, isolated purposes (and then only to the extent expressly otherwise stated), all provisions of this Lease apply equally and uniformly to all components of the Leased Property collectively as one unit. The Parties intend that the provisions of this Lease shall at all times be construed, interpreted and applied so as to carry out their mutual objective to create an indivisible lease of all of the Leased Property and, in particular but without limitation, that, for purposes of any assumption, rejection or assignment of this Lease under 11 U.S.C. Section 365, or any successor or replacement thereof or any analogous state law, this is one indivisible and enon-severable lease and executory contract dealing with one legal and economic unit and that this Lease must be assumed, rejected or assigned as a whole with respect to all (and only as to all) of the Leased Property. The Parties may elect to amend this Lease from time to time to modify the boundaries of the Land, to exclude one or more components or portions thereof, and/or to include one or more additional</p>
          <p id="s1p247">3</p>
          <p id="s1p248">components as part of the Leased Property, and any such future addition to the Leased Property shall not in any way change the indivisible and nonseverable nature of this Lease and all of the foregoing provisions shall continue to apply in full force. Furthermore, under certain circumstances as more particularly provided in this Lease below, one or more of the Facilities hereunder may, subject to the provisions of this Lease, be removed from this Lease and the corresponding portion of the Leased Property will no longer be part of the Leased Property and such reduction of the Leased Property shall not in any way change the indivisible and nonseverable nature of this Lease and all of the foregoing provisions shall continue to apply in full force with respect to the balance of the Leased Property. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 1.2 is not intended to and shall not be deemed to limit, vitiate or supersede anything contained in Section 41.17 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p249">1.3 Ter. The mTerm of this Lease shall commence on the Commencement Date and expire on the Expiration Date (i.e., the Term shall consist of the Initial Term plus all Renewal Terms, to the extent exercised as set forth in Section 1.4 below, subject to any earlier termination of the Term pursuant to the terms hereof). The initial stated term of this Lease (the Initial Term) shall commence on October 6, 2017 (the Commencement Date) and expire on October 31, 2032 (the Initial Stated Expiration Date). The Stated Expiration Date means the Initial Stated Expiration Date or the expiration date of the most recently exercised Renewal Term, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p250">1.4Renewal Term.s The Term of this Lease may be extended for four (4) separate Renewal Terms of five (5) years each if (a) at least twelve (12), but not more than eighteen (18), months prior to the then current Stated Expiration Date, Tenant (or, pursuant to Section 17.1(e), a Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee) delivers to Landlord a Renewal Notice stating that it is irrevocably exercising its right to extend this Lease for one (1) Renewal Term; and (b) no Tenant Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date Landlord receives the Renewal Notice or on the last day of the then current Term (other than a Tenant Event of Default that is in the process of being cured by a Permitted Leasehold Mortgagee in compliance in all respects with Section 17.1(d) and Section 17.1(e)). Subject to the provisions, terms and conditions of this Lease, upon Tenants timely delivery to Landlord of a Renewal Notice, the Term of this Lease shall be extended for the then applicable Renewal Term. During any such Renewal Term, except as specifically provided for herein, all of the provisions, terms and conditions of this Lease shall remain in full force and effect. After the last Renewal Term, Tenant shall have no further right to renew or extend the Term. If Tenant fails to validly and timely exercise any right to extend this Lease, then all subsequent rights to extend the Term shall terminate.</p>
          <p id="s1p251">1.5Maximum Fixed Rent Ter.m Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Term with respect to any Excluded Renewal Property shall expire as of the end of the Renewal Term immediately prior to the Renewal Term that would cause the Term to extend beyond the expiration of the Maximum Fixed Rent Term (after taking into account Maximum Fixed Rent Term extensions, if any, pursuant to clause (c)(iv) of the definition of Rent), in which event the applicable Excluded Renewal Property shall revert to Landlord and no longer shall be included in the Leased Property hereunder, and all Tenants Property pertaining to such Excluded Renewal Property (including any Gaming Licenses relating thereto) shall remain owned by Tenant.</p>

          <p id="s1p665">(i) Rent during the initial seven (7) Lease Years and Rent thereafter for the duration of the Initial Term shall be allocated as specified in Schedule 5 hereto and such allocations of Rent and Base Rent shall represent Tenants accrued liability on account of the use of the Leased Property during the Initial Term. Landlord and Tenant agree that such allocations are intended to constitute a specific allocation of fixed rent within the meaning of Treasury Regulation SS 1.467-1(c)(2)(ii)(A) to the applicable period and in the respective amounts set forth in Schedule 5 hereto. Landlord and Tenant agree, for purposes of federal income tax returns filed by it (or on any income tax returns on which its income is included), (i) to accrue rental income and rental expense, respectively during the Initial Term in the amounts equal to the Rent for a given period plus or minus the amount set forth under the caption Section 467 Rent Adjustment in Schedule 5 hereto, and (ii) to deduct interest expense and accrue interest income, respectively, in the amounts set forth under the caption Section 467 Interest in Schedule 5 hereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p666">(ii) Initial Base Rent shall be allocated among the Leased Property identified on Schedule as set forth on 5-ASchedule . On each Escalator Adjustment Date, the Escalator shall be applied to each allocated Base Rent amount, and the aggregate of such allocated amounts, each as increased by the Escalator, shall constitute Base Rent for the applicable Lease Year. Adjustments of Base Rent occurring at the commencement of the eighth (8th) Lease Year and the eleventh (11th) Lease Year shall be determined on an individual Leased Property basis, by calculating seventy percent (70%) or eighty percent (80%), respectively, of total Rent for the applicable prior Lease Year with respect to each such Leased Property, and then aggregating such resulting amounts to determine total adjusted Base Rent. Similarly, Variable Rent shall be determined on an individual Leased Property basis, by applying the formula for Variable Rent (as set forth in the definition of Rent above) to each individual Leased Property and the Net Revenue attributable thereto, and then aggregating such resulting amounts to determine total adjusted Variable Rent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining Base Rent and Variable Rent as described in this 5-ASection 3.1(e)(ii), no cap or floor shall apply to the calculations on an individual Leased Property basis, and, instead, once the individual allocated amounts are aggregated, if the resulting amount is required to be adjusted to comport with an applicable cap or floor, then the resulting decrease or increase (to comply with the cap or floor) shall be allocated pro rata among the Leased Properties.</p>

          <p id="s1p671">(b) Maintenance of Records Relating to Variable Rent Statement. Tenant shall maintain, at its corporate offices, for a period of not less than six (6) years following the end of each Lease Year, adequate records which shall evidence the Net Revenue realized by the Facility during each Lease Year, together with all such records that would normally be examined by an independent auditor pursuant to GAAP in performing an audit of Tenants Variable Rent Statements. The provisions and covenants of this Section 3.2(b) shall survive the expiration of the Term or sooner termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p672">(c) Audits. At any time within two (2) years of receipt of any Variable Rent Statement, Landlord shall have the right to cause to be conducted an independent audit of the matters covered thereby, conducted by a nationally-recognized independent public accounting firm mutually reasonably agreed to by the Parties. Such audit shall be limited to items necessary to ascertain an accurate determination of the calculation of the Variable Rent payable hereunder, and shall be conducted during normal business hours at the principal executive office of Tenant. If it shall be determined as a result of such audit (i) that there has been a deficiency in the payment of Variable Rent, such deficiency shall become due and payable by Tenant to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after such determination, or (ii) that there has been an excess payment of Variable Rent, such excess shall become due and payable by Landlord to Tenant, within thirty (30) days after such determination. In addition, if any Variable Rent Statement shall be found to have understated the per annum Variable Rent payable during any Variable Rent Payment Period by more than two and one-half percent (2.5%), and Landlord is entitled to any additional Variable Rent as a result of such understatement, then (x) Tenant shall pay to Landlord all reasonable, costs and expenses which may be incurred by Landlord in determining and collecting the understatement or underpayment, including the cost of the audit (if applicable) and (y) interest at the Overdue Rate on the amount of the deficiency from the date when said payment should have been made until paid. If it shall be determined as a result of such audit that the applicable Variable Rent Statement did not understate the per annum Variable Rent payable during any Variable Rent Payment Period by more than two and out-of-pocketone-half percent (2.5%), then Landlord shall pay to Tenant all reasonable, costs and expenses incurred by Tenant in making such determination, including the cost of the audit. In addition, if any Variable Rent out-of-pocket</p>

Any audit conducted pursuant to this Section 3.2(c) shall be performed subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 23.1(c) hereof. The receipt by Landlord of any Variable Rent Statement or any Variable Rent paid in accordance therewith for any period shall not constitute an admission of the correctness thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p675">3.3Late Payment of Rent or Additional Charge.s Tenant hereby acknowledges that the late payment by Tenant to Landlord of any Rent or Additional Charges will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated hereunder, the exact amount of which is presently anticipated to be extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, if any installment of Rent or Additional Charges payable directly to Landlord shall not be paid within four (4) days after its due date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand a late charge equal to the lesser of (a) five percent (5%) of the amount of such installment or Additional Charges and (b) the maximum amount permitted by law. The Parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord will incur by reason of late payment by Tenant. The Parties further agree that any such late charge constitutes Rent, and not interest, and such assessment does not constitute a lender or borrower/creditor relationship between Landlord and Tenant. If any installment of Rent (or Additional Charges payable directly to Landlord) shall not be paid within nine (9) days after its due date, the amount unpaid, including any late charges previously accrued and unpaid, shall bear interest at the Overdue Rate (from such ninth (9th) day after the due date of such installment until the date of payment thereof) (including interest accruing during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, whether or not a claim for such interest is allowed or allowable in such proceeding), and Tenant shall pay such interest to Landlord on demand. The payment of such late charge or such interest shall not constitute a waiver of, nor excuse or cure, any default under this Lease, nor prevent Landlord from exercising any other rights and remedies available to Landlord. No failure by Landlord to insist upon strict performance by Tenant of Tenants obligation to pay late charges and interest on sums overdue shall constitute a waiver by Landlord of its right to enforce the provisions, terms and conditions of this Section 3.3. No payment by Tenant nor receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than may be required to be paid hereunder shall be deemed to be other than on account of any such payment, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check tendered as payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction and Landlord, in its sole discretion, may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlords right to recover the balance of such payment due or pursue any other right or remedy in this Lease provided.</p>

Landlord shall provide Tenant with appropriate wire transfer, ACH and direct deposit information in a Notice from Landlord to Tenant. If Landlord directs Tenant to pay any Rent or any Additional Charges to any party other than Landlord, Tenant shall send to Landlord, simultaneously with such payment, a copy of the transmittal letter or invoice and a check whereby such payment is made or such other evidence of payment as Landlord may reasonably require.</p>

If Landlord commences any proceedings for non-payment of Rent, Tenant will not interpose any defense, offset, claim, counterclaim or cross complaint or similar pleading of any nature or description in such proceedings unless Tenant would lose or waive such claim by the failure to assert it. This shall not, however, be construed as a waiver of Tenants right to assert such claims in a separate action brought by Tenant. The covenants to pay Rent and Additional Charges hereunder are independent covenants, and Tenant shall have no right to hold back, deduct, defer, reduce, offset or fail to pay any such amounts for default by Landlord or for any other reason whatsoever, except solely as and to the extent provided in Section 3.1 and this Section 3.5.</p>
