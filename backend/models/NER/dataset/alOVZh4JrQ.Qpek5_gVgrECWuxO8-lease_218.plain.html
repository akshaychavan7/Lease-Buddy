In no event shall this provision for a late charge be deemed to grant to Tenant a grace period or extension of time within which to pay any rent or prevent Landlord from exercising any right or remedy available to Landlord upon Tenant’s failure to pay any rent due under this Lease in a timely fashion, including any right to terminate this Lease pursuant to Section 15.2B. In addition to such late charge, Tenant shall pay to Landlord interest on any rent that is not paid within ten (10) business days after it is due at the Agreed Interest Rate from the date such amount became due until paid.</p>

As Additional Rent, Tenant shall pay Tenant’s Share (specified in Section F of the Summary) of the Common Operating Expenses for each calendar year or portion thereof. Tenant shall pay such share of the Common Operating Expenses incurred or paid by Landlord but not theretofore billed to Tenant within ten (10) days after receipt of a written bill therefor from Landlord on such periodic basis as Landlord shall designate. In addition, Landlord shall require that Tenant pay Tenant’s Share of Common Operating Expenses in advance in estimated monthly installments, in accordance with the following: (a) Landlord shall deliver to Tenant Landlord’s reasonable estimate of the Common Operating Expenses it anticipates will be paid or incurred for the calendar year in question; (b) during such calendar year, Tenant shall pay Tenant’s Share of the estimated Common Operating Expenses in advance in monthly installments as required by Landlord due with the installments of Base Monthly Rent; and (c) within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each calendar year or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a statement in reasonable detail of the actual Common Operating Expenses paid or incurred by Landlord during the just ended calendar year and thereupon there shall be an adjustment between Landlord and Tenant, with payment to Landlord or credit by Landlord against the next installment of Additional Rent (or with payment to Tenant in cash if no further installments of Additional Rent are due), as the case may require, within ten (10) days after delivery by Landlord to Tenant of such statement, so that Landlord shall receive the entire amount of Tenant’s Share of all Common Operating Expenses for such calendar year, and no more. Within ninety (90) days after Landlord furnishes such statement for any calendar year (the “Audit Election Period”), Tenant may, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense during Landlord’s normal business hours, elect to audit Landlord’s Common Operating Costs for such calendar year only, subject to the following conditions: (1) the audit shall be prepared by an independent certified public accounting firm of recognized national or regional standing; (2) in no event shall any audit be performed by a firm retained on a “contingency fee” basis; (3) the audit shall commence within 30 days after Landlord makes Landlord’s books and records available to Tenant’s auditor and shall conclude within 60 days after commencement; (4) the audit shall be conducted where Landlord maintains its books and records and shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of Landlord’s business; and (5) Tenant and its accounting firm shall treat any audit in a confidential manner and shall each execute a commercially reasonable confidentiality agreement for Landlord’s benefit prior to commencing the audit. The foregoing right to audit shall also be applicable to Tenant’s Share of Common Operating Expenses payable on a periodic basis (i.e., not as part of the estimated monthly installments) except that the Audit Election Period with respect to the same shall be within the later of ninety (90) days after the later of the end of the calendar year in which such Common Operating Expenses were incurred or ninety (90) days after Landlord furnishes the statement containing such Common Operating Expenses. This paragraph shall not be construed to limit, suspend, or abate Tenant’s obligation to pay rent when due, including estimated Common Operating Expenses. Landlord shall credit any overpayment determined by the final approved audit report against the next rent due and owing by Tenant or, if no further rent is due, refund such overpayment directly to Tenant within 30 days of determination. Likewise, Tenant shall pay Landlord any underpayment determined by the final approved audit report within 30 days of determination. If the audit proves that Landlord’s calculation of Common Operating Expenses for the calendar year under inspection was overstated by more than three percent (3%), then, after verification, Landlord shall pay Tenant’s actual reasonable out-of-pocket audit and inspection fees and costs applicable to the review of said calendar year statement within thirty (30) days after receipt of Tenant’s invoice therefor. The foregoing obligations shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. If Tenant does not give written notice of its election to audit Landlord’s Common Operating Expenses during the Audit Election Period, Landlord’s Common Operating Expenses for the applicable calendar year shall be deemed approved for all purposes, and Tenant shall have no further right to review or contest the same. Landlord may revise its estimate of Common Operating Expenses from time to time, and Tenant shall thereafter make payments on the basis of the revised estimate. In the event that the Building is not one hundred percent (100%) occupied during all or any portion of any calendar year, Landlord shall make an appropriate adjustment, in accordance with industry standards and sound management practices, of the Common Operating Expenses for each such year to determine what the Common Operating</p>

          <p id="s1p163">Expenses would have been for such year if the Building had been one hundred percent (100%) occupied, and the amount so determined shall be deemed to be the amount of Common Operating Expenses for such year. Such adjustment shall be made by Landlord by increasing those costs included in the Common Operating Expenses which, according to industry standards and sound management practices, vary based upon the level of occupancy of the Building. Landlord shall have the right, from time to time, in its discretion, to equitably allocate some or all of the Common Operating Expenses among the office space tenants and the residential space tenants of the Building for purposes of determining Common Operating Expenses and/or the provision of various services and amenities. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, costs for maintenance of the parking areas shall be allocated to the office and residential portions of the Building in accordance with the ratio of parking spaces allocated between the same. Costs for (w) maintaining, repairing, operating and replacing when necessary HVAC equipment for the residential portion of the Building and the utility facilities and other building service equipment exclusively serving the residential portion of the Building and (x) providing electricity, gas and water (except irrigation water) to the residential portion of the Building shall not be allocated to the office portions of the Building, and costs for (y) maintaining, repairing, operating and replacing when necessary HVAC equipment for the office portion of the Building and the utility facilities and other building service equipment exclusively serving the office portion of the Building and (z) providing electricity, gas and water (except irrigation water) to the office portion of the Building shall not be allocated to the residential portions of the Building.</p>

To the extent any portion of the Security Deposit is used, Tenant shall within five (5) days after demand from Landlord restore the Security Deposit to its full amount.

If Tenant shall perform all of its obligations under this Lease and return the Premises to Landlord at the end of the Lease Term, Landlord shall return all of the remaining Security Deposit to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the end of the Lease Term. The Security Deposit shall not serve as an advance payment of rent or a measure of Landlord’s damages for any default under this Lease. If Landlord transfers its interest in the Project or this Lease, Landlord may transfer the Security Deposit to its transferee. Upon such transfer, Landlord shall have no further obligation to return the Security Deposit. Tenant shall look solely to the new landlord for the return of the Security Deposit.

In lieu of a cash Security Deposit, the Security Deposit to be delivered by Tenant to Landlord may be in the form of an irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit (the “Letter of Credit”) governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 590, as revised from time to time, in an amount the amount set forth in Section K of the Summary, issued to Landlord, as beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, by Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank or other bank reasonably approved by Landlord and qualified to transact banking business in California with an office in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area at which drafts drawn on the Letter of Credit may be presented for payment. The full amount of the Letter of Credit shall be available to Landlord upon presentation of Landlord’s sight draft accompanied only by the Letter of Credit and Landlord’s signed statement that Landlord is entitled to draw on the Letter of Credit pursuant to this Lease. Tenant shall maintain the Letter of Credit for the entire Lease Term and any extension thereof. The Letter of Credit shall expressly state that the Letter of Credit and the right to draw thereunder may be transferred or assigned by Landlord to any successor or assignee of Landlord under this Lease. Tenant shall pay any fees related to the issuance or amendment of the Letter of Credit, including, without limitation, any transfer fees. The Letter of Credit shall permit partial draws. The Letter of Credit shall provide that it will be automatically renewed until thirty (30) days after the Expiration Date unless the issuer provides Landlord with written notice of non-renewal at the notice address herein at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration thereof. If, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Letter of Credit, Tenant fails to furnish Landlord with a replacement Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Section, then Landlord shall have the right to draw the full amount of the Letter of Credit, by sight draft, and shall hold the proceeds of the Letter of Credit as a cash Security Deposit pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 6.1 above. In such event, Landlord may keep the Security Deposit in its general funds and shall not be required to pay interest to Tenant on the deposit amount.</p>

In no event shall the Security Deposit be further reduced to an amount below $0.00. If the Security Deposit is in the form of a Letter of Credit, such Reduction(s) shall be effected either by Tenant exchanging a replacement Letter of Credit meeting the requirements of this Section 6 in the reduced amount for the existing Letter of Credit, or by the issuing bank delivering an amendment to the Letter of Credit reducing the amount thereof (but which does not otherwise amend or modify same), which Landlord shall promptly countersign or authorize in writing if required by the issuing bank. In the event the Security Deposit is in cash, such Reduction(s) shall be effected by Landlord applying the amount of the applicable Reduction to the Base Rent next coming due after the applicable Potential Reduction Date. Upon such Reduction(s), the term “Security Deposit,” as used herein, shall automatically be deemed to refer only to the amount being held by Landlord as a Security Deposit after such Reduction(s).</p>

In making such repairs, restorations, replacements, alterations, additions or improvements by Landlord, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Tenant’s use of the Premises as a result of the same (which reasonable efforts shall not require Landlord to perform work outside of normal business hours); provided, however, that if such repairs, restorations, replacements, alterations, additions or improvements by Landlord (a) continue for two (2) consecutive business days and (b) as a result the Premises are rendered untenantable and Tenant actually ceases to use the Premises, commencing on the third (3rd) consecutive business day thereof, Tenant shall, as its sole remedy, be entitled to an equitable diminution of rent based upon the pro rata portion of the Premises which is rendered unfit for occupancy for the permitted use and actually not used by Tenant, except to the extent such repairs, restorations, replacements, alterations, additions or improvements by Landlord are in connection with damage caused by Tenant or its employees, agents, contractors, invitees, or licensees or are otherwise at Tenant’s request.</p>

Unless resulting from the willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlord’s Agents, Landlord shall not be liable for any failure to provide access to the Premises, to assure the beneficial use of the Premises or to furnish any services or utilities when such failure is caused by natural occurrences, riots, civil disturbances, insurrection, war, court order, public enemy, accidents, breakage, strikes, lockouts, other labor disputes, the making of repairs, alterations or improvements to the Premises or the Building, the inability to obtain an adequate supply of fuel, gas, steam, water, electricity, communication services, labor or other supplies or by any other condition beyond Landlord’s reasonable control, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any damages resulting from such failure, nor shall such failure relieve Tenant of the obligation to pay all sums due hereunder or constitute or be construed as a constructive or other eviction of Tenant To the extent any such failure arises from a</p>

If any governmental entity promulgates or revises any statute, ordinance or building, fire or other code, or imposes mandatory or voluntary controls or guidelines on Landlord or the Building or any part thereof, relating to the use or conservation of energy, water, gas, steam, light, communication services or electricity or the provision of any other utility or service provided with respect to this Lease, or if Landlord is required or elects to make alterations to the Building in order to comply with such mandatory or voluntary controls or guidelines, Landlord may, in its sole discretion, comply with such mandatory or voluntary controls or guidelines, or make such alterations to the Building (subject to the last sentence of Section 4.2D). Neither such compliance nor the making of such alterations shall in any event entitle Tenant to any damages, relieve Tenant of the obligation to pay any of the sums due hereunder or constitute or be construed as a constructive or other eviction of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p210">9.3 Compliance with Governmental Regulations. Landlord and Tenant shall comply with all rules, regulations and requirements promulgated by national, state or local governmental agencies or utility suppliers concerning the use of utility services, including any rationing, limitation or other control.

Landlord may, at any time, and from time to time, inspect and copy any and all insurance policies required to be procured by Tenant pursuant to this Section 10.1. If any Lender or insurance advisor reasonably determines at any time that the amount of coverage required for any policy of insurance Tenant is to obtain pursuant to this Section 10.1 is not adequate, then Tenant shall increase such coverage for such insurance to such amount as such Lender or insurance advisor reasonably deems adequate, not to exceed the level of coverage for such insurance commonly carried by tenants of comparable premises in the vicinity of the Project. In such case, Landlord shall provide to Tenant reasonable evidence that such increase in coverage does not exceed the level of coverage for such insurance commonly carried by tenants of comparable premises in the vicinity of the Project (which reasonable evidence may consist of a statement by a local real estate or insurance broker to that effect). In addition, Landlord shall not require any such additional coverage not stated in this Section 10.1 during the first five (5) years of the Lease Term.</p>

Landlord may so insure the Project separately, or may insure the Project with other property owned by Landlord which Landlord elects to insure together under the same policy or policies. Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole and absolute discretion, to obtain insurance for such additional perils that Landlord deems appropriate, including, without limitation, coverage for damage by earthquake and/or flood. All such coverage shall contain “deductibles” which Landlord deems appropriate, which deductibles (except for earthquake) must be commercially reasonable.

Tenant agrees that Landlord’s consent shall not be considered unreasonably withheld if: (a) the proposed transferee’s financial condition does not meet the criteria Landlord uses to select Building tenants having similar leasehold obligations; (b) the proposed transferee is a governmental organization; (c) any uncured Event of Tenant’s Default exists under this Lease (or a condition exists which, with the passage of time or giving of notice, would become an Event of Tenant’s Default); (d) any portion of the Building or Project would likely become subject to additional or different Laws as a consequence of the proposed Transfer; (e) the proposed transferee’s use of the Premises conflicts with the Permitted Use or any exclusive usage rights granted to any other tenant in the Building; (f) the use, nature, business, activities or reputation in the business community of the proposed transferee (or its principals, employees or invitees) does not meet Landlord’s standards for Building tenants; (g) either the Transfer or any consideration payable to Landlord in connection therewith adversely affects the real estate investment trust (or pension fund or other ownership vehicle) qualification tests applicable to Landlord or its affiliates (if applicable); or (h) the proposed transferee is or has been involved in litigation with Landlord or any of its affiliates. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by Landlord in connection with the evaluation, processing, and/or documentation of any requested Transfer, whether or not Landlord’s consent is granted. Landlord’s reasonable costs shall include the cost of any review or investigation performed by Landlord or consultant acting on Landlord’s behalf of (1) Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section 17.3 of this Lease) used, stored, released, or disposed of by the potential subtenant or assignee, and/or (2) violations of Hazardous Materials Law (as defined in Section 17.3 of this Lease) by Tenant or the proposed subtenant or assignee. Any Transfer so approved by Landlord shall not be effective until Tenant has delivered to Landlord an executed counterpart of the document evidencing the Transfer which (x) is in a form reasonably approved by Landlord, (y) contains the same terms and conditions as stated in Tenant’s notice given to Landlord pursuant to Section 14.1B, and (z) in the case of an assignment of this Lease, contains the agreement of the proposed transferee to assume all obligations of Tenant under this Lease arising after the effective date of such Transfer and to remain jointly and severally liable therefor with Tenant. Any attempted Transfer without Landlord’s consent shall constitute an Event of Tenant’s Default and shall be voidable at Landlord’s option. Landlord’s consent to any one Transfer shall not constitute a waiver of the provisions of this Section 14.1 as to any subsequent Transfer or a consent to any subsequent Transfer. No Transfer, even with the consent of Landlord, shall relieve Tenant of its personal and primary obligation to pay the rent and to perform all of the other obligations to be performed by Tenant hereunder. The acceptance of rent by Landlord from any person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease nor to be a consent to any Transfer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section 1995.310 of the California Civil Code, or any similar or successor laws, now of hereafter in effect, and all other remedies for a default by Landlord under this Article 14, including without limitation any right at law or equity to terminate this Lease, on its own behalf and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, on behalf of the proposed transferee</p>
          <p id="s1p262">-20-</p>
          <p id="s1p263">B. At least thirty (30) days before a proposed Transfer is to become effective, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of the proposed terms of such Transfer and request Landlord’s approval, which notice shall include the following: (i) the name and legal composition of the proposed transferee; (ii) a current financial statement of the transferee, financial statements of the transferee covering the preceding three (3) years if the same exist, and (if available) an audited financial statement of the transferee for a period ending not more than one (1) year prior to the proposed effective date of the Transfer, all of which statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (iii) the nature of the proposed transferee’s business to be carried on in the Premises; (iv) all consideration to be given on account of the Transfer; and (v) a current financial statement of Tenant. Tenant shall provide to Landlord such other information as may be reasonably requested by Landlord within seven (7) days after Landlord’s receipt of such notice from Tenant. Landlord shall respond in writing to Tenant’s request for Landlord’s consent to a Transfer within the later of (a) thirty (30) days of receipt of such request together with the required accompanying documentation, or (b) fifteen (15) days after Landlord’s receipt of all information which Landlord reasonably requests after it receives Tenant’s first notice regarding the Transfer in question. If Landlord fails to respond in writing within such period, Landlord will be deemed to have withheld consent to such Transfer. Tenant shall immediately notify Landlord of any material modification to the proposed terms of such Transfer, which shall also be subject Landlord’s consent in accordance with the same process for obtaining Landlord’s initial consent to such Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p264">C. In the event that Tenant seeks to make any assignment of the Lease or seeks to sublease, for fifty percent (50%) or more of the remainder of the Term, all or a portion of the Premises, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease or, in the case of such a sublease of less than all of the Premises, terminate this Lease as to that part of the Premises proposed to be so sublet. In the event that Landlord elects to so terminate this Lease, then this Lease shall so terminate in its entirety (or as to the space to be so sublet as the case may be) thirty (30) days after Landlord has notified Tenant in writing of such election. In the case of a partial termination of this Lease, the Base Monthly Rent and Tenant’s Share shall be reduced to an amount which bears the same relationship to the original amount thereof as the area of that part of the Premises which remains subject to this Lease bears to the original area of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p265">D. If Landlord consents to a Transfer proposed by Tenant, Tenant may enter into such Transfer, and if Tenant does so, the following shall apply:</p>
          <p id="s1p266">(1) Tenant shall not be released of its liability for the performance of its obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p267">(2) If Tenant assigns its interest in this Lease, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent (50%) of all Subrent (as defined in Section 14.1D(5)) received by Tenant related to such assignment less all Transfer Costs (hereinafter defined). In the case of an assignment, the amount of Subrent owed to Landlord shall be paid to Landlord on the same basis, whether periodic or in lump sum, that such Subrent is paid to Tenant by the assignee. Where the amount of Subrent under this Section 14.1D(2) is paid to Tenant on a periodic basis, for purposes of the calculation under this Section 14.1D(2), Transfer Costs shall be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of such assignment.</p>
          <p id="s1p268">(3) If Tenant sublets any part of the Premises, then with respect to the space to be subleased, Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent (50%) of the positive difference, if any, between (a) all Subrent paid by the subtenant to Tenant (after deducting therefrom Transfer Costs, which Transfer Costs, for purposes of this calculation, shall be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of such sublease), less (b) the sum of all Base Monthly Rent and Additional Rent allocable to the space sublet. Such amount shall be paid to Landlord on the same basis, whether periodic or in lump sum, that such Subrent is paid to Tenant by its subtenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p269">-21-</p>
          <p id="s1p270">(4) Tenant’s obligations under this Section 14.1D shall survive any Transfer, and Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations hereunder shall be an Event of Tenant’s Default. At the time Tenant makes any payment to Landlord required by this Section 14.1D, Tenant shall deliver an itemized statement of the method by which the amount to which Landlord is entitled was calculated, certified by Tenant as true and correct. Landlord shall have the right at reasonable intervals to inspect Tenant’s books and records relating to the payments due hereunder. Upon request therefor, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord copies of all bills, invoices or other documents upon which its calculations are based. Landlord may condition its approval of any Transfer upon obtaining a certification from both Tenant and the proposed transferee of all Subrent and other amounts that are to be paid to Tenant in connection with such Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p271">(5) As used in this Section 14.1D, the term “Subrent” shall mean any consideration of any kind received, or to be received, by Tenant as a result of the Transfer, if such sums are related to Tenant’s interest in this Lease or in the Premises, including payments from or on behalf of the transferee (in excess of the fair market value thereof) for Tenant’s assets, fixtures, leasehold improvements, inventory, accounts, goodwill, equipment, furniture, and general intangibles. As used in this Section 14.1D, the term “Transfer Costs” shall mean the following costs and expenses incurred by Tenant in connection with a Transfer: (a) any real estate brokerage commissions or fees payable in connection with such Transfer; (b) costs for tenant improvements or other alterations in the Premises in connection with the Transfer; (c) any space planning, architectural or design fees or expenses incurred in connection with such Transfer; and (d) any reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Tenant in connection with the Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p272">(6) In the event of a default by any assignee, sublessee or other successor of Tenant in the performance of any of the terms or obligations of Tenant under this Lease, Landlord may proceed directly against Tenant without the necessity of exhausting remedies against any such assignee, sublessee or other successor. In addition, Tenant immediately and irrevocably assigns to Landlord, as security for Tenant’s obligations under the Lease, all rent from any subletting of all or a part of the Premises as permitted under this Lease, and Landlord, as Tenant’s assignee, or any receiver for Tenant appointed on Landlord’s application, may collect such rent and apply it toward Tenant’s obligations under the Lease; except that, until the occurrence of an Event of Tenant’s Default, Tenant shall have the right to collect such rent subject to the provisions of Sections 14.1D(2) and (3).</p>
          <p id="s1p273">E. Intentionally Deleted.</p>
          <p id="s1p274">F. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 14.1, Tenant may assign its entire interest under this Lease or sublease all or any part of the Premises to (i) its Affiliate (defined below), (ii) a successor to Tenant by merger or (iii) a purchaser of all or substantially all of Tenant’s equity interests or assets (each a “Permitted Transferee”), without the consent of Landlord (a “Permitted Transfer”), provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied in Landlord’s reasonable discretion: (a) Tenant is not in default (beyond any applicable notice and cure periods) hereunder at the time of the proposed Transfer; (b) the proposed transferee will not be inconsistent with the character of the Building and its other tenants; (c) the proposed transferee has a tangible net worth equal to or exceeding the tangible net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such proposed Transfer; and (d) Tenant shall give Landlord written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the proposed Transfer (unless such prior notice would be in violation of applicable law or contract, in which case notice shall be given as promptly as possible following the Transfer), along with all applicable documentation and other information necessary for Landlord to determine that the requirements of this provision have been satisfied, including if applicable, the qualification of such proposed transferee as an Affiliate of Tenant. The term “Affiliate” means any person or entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p275">-22-</p>
          <p id="s1p276">14.2 Transfer By Landlord. Landlord and its successors in interest shall have the right to transfer their interest in this Lease and the Project at any time and to any person or entity. In the event of any such transfer, whether by sale, lease or sublease, foreclosure, deed in lieu, or otherwise, the named Landlord (or the then grantor) shall be and hereby is entirely freed and relieved of all covenants and obligations of Landlord hereunder, and it shall be deemed and construed without further agreement between the parties or their successors in interest, or between the parties and any such transferee that such transferee has assumed and agreed to carry out any and all covenants and obligations of the named Landlord (or the then grantor) and is the Landlord hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p277">15. Default and Remedies.</p>
          <p id="s1p278">15.1 Events of Tenant’s Default. Tenant shall be in default of its obligations under this Lease if any of the following events occurs (an “Event of Tenant’s Default”):</p>
          <p id="s1p279">A. Tenant shall have failed to pay Base Monthly Rent or Additional Rent when due where such failure is not cured within five (5) business days after written notice from Landlord of such failure; or</p>
          <p id="s1p280">B. Tenant shall have failed to perform any term, covenant, or condition of this Lease except those requiring the payment of Base Monthly Rent or Additional Rent, and Tenant shall have failed to cure such breach within fifteen (15) days after written notice from Landlord specifying the nature of such breach where such breach could reasonably be cured within such fifteen (15) day period, or if such breach could not be reasonably cured within such fifteen (15) day period, Tenant shall have failed to commence such cure within such fifteen (15) day period and thereafter continue with due diligence to prosecute such cure to completion within such time period as is reasonably needed, but not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date of Landlord’s notice; or</p>
          <p id="s1p281">C. Tenant shall have sublet the Premises or assigned its interest in this Lease in violation of the provisions contained in Article 14; or</p>

The occurrence of the following: (i) the making by Tenant of any general arrangements or assignments for the benefit of creditors; (ii) Tenant becomes a “debtor” as defined in 11 U.S.C. Section 101 or any successor statute thereto (unless, in the case of a petition filed against Tenant, the same is dismissed within sixty (60) days); (iii) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of Tenant’s assets located at the Premises or of Tenant’s interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to Tenant within thirty (30) days; or (iv) the attachment, execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant’s assets located at the Premises or of Tenant’s interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged within thirty (30) days; provided, however, in the event that any provision of this Section 15.1E is contrary to any applicable Law, such provision shall be of no force or effect;</p>
          <p id="s1p284">F. Tenant shall have failed to deliver documents required of it pursuant to Section 18.5 or Section 18.7 within the time periods specified therein; or</p>
          <p id="s1p285">G. Any three (3) material failures by Tenant to observe and perform any provision of this Lease during any twelve (12) month period of the Lease Term, as such may be extended, shall constitute, at the option of Landlord, a separate and noncurable default.</p>
          <p id="s1p286">-23-</p>
          <p id="s1p287">15.2 Landlord’s Remedies. If an Event of Tenant’s Default occurs, Landlord shall have the following remedies, in addition to all other rights and remedies provided by any Law or otherwise provided in this Lease, to which Landlord may resort cumulatively or in the alternative:</p>
          <p id="s1p288">A. Landlord may keep this Lease in effect and enforce by an action at law or in equity all of its rights and remedies under this Lease, including (i) the right to recover the rent and other sums as they become due by appropriate legal action, (ii) the right to make payments required of Tenant or perform Tenant’s obligations and be reimbursed by Tenant for the cost thereof with interest at the Agreed Interest Rate from the date the sum is paid by Landlord until Landlord is reimbursed by Tenant, and (iii) the remedies of injunctive relief and specific performance to compel Tenant to perform its obligations under this Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, in the event of a breach of an obligation by Tenant, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure the breach of Tenant and be reimbursed by Tenant for the cost thereof with interest at the Agreed Interest Rate from the date the sum is paid by Landlord until Landlord is reimbursed by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p289">B. Landlord may terminate this Lease by giving Tenant written notice of termination, in which event this Lease shall terminate on the date set forth for termination in such notice. Any termination under this Section 15.2B shall not relieve Tenant from its obligation to pay sums then due Landlord or from any claim against Tenant for damages or rent previously accrued or then accruing. In no event shall any one or more of the following actions by Landlord, in the absence of a written election by Landlord to terminate this Lease, constitute a termination of this Lease: (i) appointment of a receiver or keeper in order to protect Landlord’s interest hereunder; (ii) acts of maintenance or preservation or efforts to relet the Premises; or (iii) any other action by Landlord or Landlord’s Agents intended to mitigate the adverse effects of any breach of this Lease by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p290">C. Landlord shall have the remedy described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (Landlord may continue the Lease in effect after Tenant’s breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due). In the event Tenant breaches this Lease and abandons the Premises, this Lease shall not terminate unless Landlord gives Tenant written notice of its election to so terminate this Lease. No act by or on behalf of Landlord intended to mitigate the adverse effect of such breach, including those described by Section 15.2B, shall constitute a termination of Tenant’s right to possession unless Landlord gives Tenant written notice of termination.</p>
          <p id="s1p291">D. In the event Landlord terminates this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled, at Landlord’s election, to damages in an amount as set forth in California Civil Code Section 1951.2 as in effect on the Effective Date. Such damages shall include, without limitation:</p>
          <p id="s1p292">(1) The worth at the time of award of the unpaid rent and additional rent which had been earned at the time of termination, computed by allowing interest at the Agreed Interest Rate;</p>
          <p id="s1p293">(2) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent and additional rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided, computed by allowing interest at the Agreed Interest Rate;</p>
          <p id="s1p294">(3) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided, computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%); and</p>
          <p id="s1p295">-24-</p>
          <p id="s1p296">(4) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.</p>
          <p id="s1p297">E. Nothing in this Section 15.2 shall limit Landlord’s right to indemnification from Tenant as provided in Section 17.1 or Section 11.3. Any notice given by Landlord in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 15.1 above shall also be deemed to satisfy the notice requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1161 and 1162 regarding unlawful detainer proceedings.</p>
          <p id="s1p298">15.3 Waiver. One party’s consent to or approval of any act by the other party requiring the first party’s consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary the first party’s consent to or approval of any subsequent similar act by the other party. The receipt by Landlord of any rent or payment with or without knowledge of the breach of any other provision hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of any such breach unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Landlord. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy accruing to either party upon any breach by the other party under this Lease shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver of any such breach theretofore or thereafter occurring. The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Lease shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or of any other provisions herein contained.</p>
          <p id="s1p299">15.4 Limitation on Exercise of Rights. At any time that an Event of Tenant’s Default has occurred and remains uncured, it shall not be unreasonable for Landlord to deny or withhold any consent or approval requested of it by Tenant which Landlord would otherwise be obligated to give.</p>
          <p id="s1p300">15.5 Waiver by Tenant of Certain Remedies. Tenant waives the provisions of Sections 1932(1), 1941 and 1942 of the California Civil Code and any similar or successor law regarding Tenant’s right to terminate this Lease or to make repairs and deduct the expenses of such repairs from the rent due under this Lease. Tenant hereby waives any right of redemption or relief from forfeiture under the laws of the State of California, or under any other present or future law, including the provisions of Sections 473, 1174 and 1179 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and Section 3275 of the California Civil Code.</p>
          <p id="s1p301">15.6 Default by Landlord. Landlord shall not be in default of any obligation unless and until it has failed to perform such obligation within thirty (30) days after written notice from Tenant specifying Landlord’s failure to perform; but if more than thirty (30) days are required for performance, then Landlord shall not be in default if it commences performance within such thirty (30)-day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes same to completion.</p>
          <p id="s1p302">16. Landlord’s Reserved Rights.</p>
          <p id="s1p303">16.1 Construction of Additional Improvements. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord may from time to time construct additional improvements in the Building and on the Project (including, without limitation, additional buildings). Landlord shall have the right to construct such improvements, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement of rent as a result of such construction, including, without limitation, due to the noise, dust, additional traffic, additional usage of and wear and tear on the Common Area, loss of view or disruption associated therewith so long as Tenant’s parking rights and Tenant’s access to the Premises is not materially diminished (but subject to Section 7.2). Tenant waives any and all claims that it or its employees, invitees, agents or contractors may have as a result thereof. The design, location and configuration of such improvements shall be in Landlord’s sole discretion. As a result of the construction of such improvements, portions of the Common Area, including, without limitation, parking location, configuration and access, may be temporarily or permanently closed or modified. None of the foregoing shall give rise to any rights or claims by Tenant, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any compensation or abatement</p>
          <p id="s1p304">-25-</p>
          <p id="s1p305">of any kind with respect thereto. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Tenant’s use of the Premises as a result of such construction (which reasonable efforts shall not require Landlord to perform work outside of normal business hours). Provided Tenant’s parking rights and Tenant’s access to the Premises is not materially diminished, Landlord shall have the right in its sole discretion to sell portions of the Project or to develop portions of the Project as separate projects, in which case such portions of the Project shall thereafter be excluded from the term “Project”.</p>
          <p id="s1p306">16.2 Landlord’s Right to Enter. Landlord and its Agents may enter the Premises at any reasonable time after giving at least twenty-four (24) hours’ prior notice to Tenant, which may be given orally (except in the case of emergency in which event entry may be made immediately at any time without requirement of such notice) for the purpose of: (a) inspecting the same; (b) posting notices of non- responsibility; (c) supplying any service to be provided by Landlord to Tenant; (d) showing the Premises to prospective purchasers, mortgagees or, during the last twelve (12) months of the Lease Term, tenants; (e) making alterations, additions or repairs; (f) performing Tenant’s obligations when Tenant has failed to do so after written notice from Landlord; (g) placing upon the Premises ordinary “for lease” signs or “for sale” signs; and (h) responding to an emergency. Landlord shall have the right to use any and all means Landlord may deem necessary and proper to enter the Premises in an emergency. Any entry into the Premises obtained by Landlord in accordance with this Section shall not be a forcible or unlawful entry into, or a detainer of, the Premises, or an eviction, actual or constructive, of Tenant from the Premises. Tenant shall at all times provide to Landlord, and Landlord shall at all times have the right to retain, all card keys (and other keys) necessary for Landlord to enter the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p307">16.3 Control of Common Area. Landlord shall at all times have exclusive control of the Common Area. Landlord shall have the right, without the same constituting an actual or constructive eviction and without entitling Tenant to any abatement of rent, to: (a) close any part of the Common Area to whatever extent required in the opinion of Landlord’s counsel to prevent a dedication thereof or the accrual of any prescriptive rights therein; (b) temporarily close the Common Area to perform maintenance or for any other reason deemed sufficient by Landlord; (c) change the shape, size, location and extent of the Common Area; (d) eliminate from or add to the Project and the Common Area any land or improvement; (e) make changes to the Common Area including, without limitation, changes in the location of driveways, entrances, passageways, doors and doorways, elevators, stairs, restrooms, exits, parking spaces, parking areas, sidewalks or the direction of the flow of traffic; (f) remove unauthorized persons from the Project; and/or (g) change the name or address of the Building or Project. Tenant shall keep the Common Area clear of all obstructions created or permitted by Tenant. If, in the opinion of Landlord, unauthorized persons are using any of the Common Area by reason of the presence of Tenant in the Building, Tenant, upon demand of Landlord, shall restrain such unauthorized use by appropriate proceedings. In exercising any such rights regarding the Common Area, (i) Landlord shall make a reasonable effort to minimize any disruption to Tenant’s business, and (ii) Landlord shall not exercise its rights to control the Common Area in a manner that would materially interfere with Tenant’s use of or access to the Premises without first obtaining Tenant’s consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Landlord shall have no obligation to provide guard services or other security measures for the benefit of the Project. Tenant assumes all responsibility for the protection of Tenant and Tenant’s Agents from acts of third parties; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Landlord, at its sole option, from providing security measures for the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p308">16.4 Change in Area. If from time to time there is a change in the net rentable area in the Building held for lease, whether as a result of addition of area through construction, a diminution of area as a result of a casualty described in Section 12, a taking by eminent domain or condemnation described in Section 13 or a physical change in such area for any other reason that in Landlord’s opinion will continue in excess of six (6) months, then Landlord may notify Tenant that the Building Net Rentable Area set forth in Section E of the Summary shall be changed, until any further notice of change, to mean the number of square feet of net</p>

          <p id="s1p310">rentable area in the Building held for commercial lease by Landlord as reasonably determined by Landlord on completion of such change. In such event, the Tenant’s Share set forth in Section F of the Summary shall be adjusted accordingly so long as the shares of all other tenants in the Building are similarly adjusted.</p>
          <p id="s1p311">17. Hazardous Materials. Landlord and Tenant agree as follows with respect to the existence or use of Hazardous Materials on the Project:</p>
          <p id="s1p312">17.1 Tenant shall not use or permit Tenant’s Agents to transport, store, treat, dispose, use or otherwise bring onto the Project any Hazardous Materials. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any handling, transportation, storage, treatment, disposal or use of Hazardous Materials by Tenant and Tenant’s Agents in or about the Project shall strictly comply with all applicable Hazardous Materials Laws. Tenant shall indemnify, defend upon demand with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord, protect and hold harmless Landlord from and against any liabilities, losses, claims, damages, lost profits, consequential damages, interest, penalties, fines, monetary sanctions, attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, court costs, remediation costs, investigation costs, and other expenses to the extent resulting from or arising in any manner whatsoever out of the use, storage, treatment, transportation, release, or disposal of Hazardous Materials on or about the Project by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents.</p>
          <p id="s1p313">17.2 As used herein, the term “Hazardous Material,” means any hazardous or toxic substance, material or waste which is or becomes regulated by any local governmental authority, the State of California or the United States Government. The term “Hazardous Material,” includes, without limitation, petroleum products, asbestos, PCB’s, and any material or substance which is (i) listed under Article 9 or defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous pursuant to Article 11 of Title 22 of the California Administrative Code, Division 4, Chapter 20, (ii) defined as a “hazardous waste” pursuant to Section 1004 of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.

Tenant shall be solely responsible for the costs in connection with the design, fabrication and installation of Tenant’s name on the Eyebrow Signs. Tenant must obtain Landlord’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the Eyebrow Signs prior to fabrication and installation. When requesting Landlord’s consent, Tenant shall submit design drawings to Landlord showing the type and sizes of all lettering and the colors, finishes and types of materials used. If during the Lease Term (and any extensions thereof) (a) Tenant is in default under the terms of the Lease after the expiration of applicable cure periods, or (b) Tenant fails to continuously occupy the Premises or (c) Tenant assigns the Lease or subleases any part of the Premises, then Tenant’s rights granted herein will terminate, and Tenant shall remove such Eyebrow Signs at Tenant’s sole cost and expense and repair any damage cause by such removal.</p>

If Landlord grants to any tenant or third party the exclusive right to use any particular parking space(s), Tenant shall not use such spaces. In the event Landlord is required by any Law to limit or control parking in the Project, whether by validation of parking tickets or any other method of assessment, Tenant agrees to participate in such validation or assessment program under such reasonable rules and regulations as are from time to time established by Landlord. Landlord shall have no obligation to monitor or enforce any rules regarding the use of parking in the Project. Tenant’s right to park hereunder shall be at no charge to Tenant except to the extent required by a governmental agency or municipality or otherwise required by Law.</p>

In any event, Tenant shall cause the following to be done prior to the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease: (i) all interior walls shall be cleaned; (ii) all tiled floors shall be cleaned; and (iii) all carpets shall be cleaned.

          <p id="s1p327">18.4 Holding Over. This Lease shall terminate without further notice at the expiration of the Lease Term.

Landlord represents and warrants that as of the Effective Date, there are no Security Instruments encumbering the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p330">B. This Lease shall become subject and subordinate to any Security Instrument created after the Effective Date; provided, however, with respect to any such future Security Instrument, Tenant shall only be obligated to subordinate its leasehold interest to such future Lender and its Security Instrument if the Lender grants to Tenant a non-disturbance agreement, using the commercially reasonable form of document then being employed by such Lender, which will provide that Tenant, notwithstanding any default of Landlord under such Security Instrument, shall have the right to remain in possession of the Premises described herein in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Lease for so long as Tenant shall not be in default under this Lease. However, if any Lender so requires, this Lease shall become prior and superior to any such Lender’s Security Instrument.</p>
          <p id="s1p331">C. The foregoing agreements shall be effective without the execution of additional documents; provided, however, Tenant shall upon request execute any document or instrument required by any Lender to make this Lease either prior or subordinate to a Security Instrument (but subject to Section 18.5.B above with respect to future Security Instruments), which may include such other matters as the Lender customarily and reasonably requires in connection with such agreements, including provisions that the Lender not be liable for (i) the return of any security deposit unless the Lender receives it from Landlord, and (ii) any defaults on the part of Landlord occurring prior to the time the Lender takes possession of the Project in connection with the enforcement of its Security Instrument. Tenant’s failure to execute any such document or instrument within ten (10) business days after written request therefor shall constitute an Event of Tenant’s Default.</p>
          <p id="s1p332">18.6 Mortgagee Protection and Attornment. In the event of any default on the part of the Landlord, Tenant will give notice by certified mail to any Lender whose name has been provided to Tenant and, if such default would give Tenant the right to terminate the Lease, Tenant shall not exercise such right to terminate until Tenant shall have provided such notice to such Lender and offered such Lender a reasonable opportunity to cure the default, including time to obtain possession of the Premises by power of sale or judicial foreclosure or other appropriate legal proceedings, if such should prove necessary to effect a cure.</p>

          <p id="s1p334">The preceding sentence shall not affect Tenant’s rights to terminate the Lease pursuant to Sections 12, 13 and 21 of the Lease. Tenant shall attorn to any purchaser of the Premises at any foreclosure sale or private sale conducted pursuant to any Security Instrument encumbering the Premises, or to any grantee or transferee designated in any deed given in lieu of foreclosure. If in connection with obtaining financing for the Project or any portion thereof, any Lender shall request reasonable modifications to this Lease as a condition to such financing, Tenant shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or defer its consent thereto, provided such modifications do not materially adversely affect Tenant’s rights or obligations hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p335">18.7 Estoppel Certificates and Financial Statements. Tenant shall, from time to time, within ten (10) business days after Landlord’s request therefor, deliver to Landlord a statement certifying that this Lease is in full force and effect, that this Lease is unmodified, or if modified, stating any such modifications, that there are no defenses or offsets to the Lease by Tenant, or stating such defenses or offsets as are claimed by Tenant, that Landlord is not in default hereunder or specifying any defaults by Landlord that Tenant alleges, and specifying the date to which rent has been paid, and specifying any further information about this Lease or the Premises that Landlord may reasonably request. Tenant’s failure to deliver such certificate within such time shall be an Event of Tenant’s Default. Tenant agrees that such certificates may be relied upon by prospective purchasers or Lenders of the Building or the Project. Tenant represents and warrants that all financial statements and information provided to Landlord prior to execution of this Lease or in connection with obtaining any consent are true and correct and accurately reflect the financial condition of the person covered by such statements as of the date of such statements and that no material adverse change has occurred since such date.

          <p id="s1p480">PREMISES PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS</p>
          <p id="s1p481">Tenant shall submit to Landlord proposed Premises Plans and Specifications for Completion of the Premises within sixty (60) days after the Lease is executed by Landlord and Tenant. Such plans and specifications (and any revised plans and specifications) shall be signed and stamped by Tenant’s Architect for filing with all appropriate governmental authorities. Such plans and specifications shall in all respects comply with all applicable laws, codes, ordinance, regulations and other governmental requirements. Landlord’s approval of such plans and specifications shall not be unreasonably withheld with respect to non-structural interior portions of the Tenant’s Work which do not affect the Building systems and may be withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion with respect to exterior and/or structural portions of the Tenant’s Work or any work affecting the Building systems. If Landlord rejects the plans and specifications, Tenant shall revise the plans and specifications based upon Landlord’s reasons for rejection and resubmit them to Landlord for approval. The foregoing process shall be repeated until the Premises Plans and Specifications have been approved by Landlord. Upon Landlord’s approval of the Premises Plans and Specifications, they shall be clearly marked “Approved and Issued for Construction” and initialed by Tenant and Landlord. Tenant shall submit such necessary applications to the applicable governmental authorities to receive any required permits promptly following Landlord’s approval of the Premises Plans and Specifications. Any changes in the Premises Plans</p>
          <p id="s1p482">and Specifications after approval by Landlord may be made only pursuant to a request in writing by Tenant to be approved by Landlord as set forth above. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any reasonable sums incurred by Landlord for third party examination of Tenant’s Plans and Specifications (and any revised Plans and Specifications) and for any other costs incurred by Landlord in connection with any services provided in connection with the Tenant Work, all to which Tenant may apply the Reimbursement Allowance (defined below).</p>
          <p id="s1p483">SECTION 6</p>
          <p id="s1p484">LANDLORD REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTAIN</p>
          <p id="s1p485">PREMISES IMPROVEMENTS COSTS</p>
          <p id="s1p486">A. Provided Tenant is not in default under the Lease, Landlord will provide Tenant with an allowance equal to Fifty Dollars ($50) per rentable square foot of the Premises (i.e., Nine Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand Fifty Dollars ($927,050) (the “Reimbursement Allowance”) to be applied toward the cost of Completion of the Premises. Tenant shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for payment of the entire cost of the Tenant’s Work in excess of the Reimbursement Allowance. The funding of the Reimbursement Allowance shall be made pursuant to Sections 6.B and 6.D below and in all other respects shall be based on such commercially reasonable disbursement conditions and procedures as Landlord may reasonably prescribe. The Reimbursement Allowance may only be used for hard construction costs and engineering, architectural and design fees. The Reimbursement Allowance may not be used for the purchase of equipment, furniture or other items of personal property of Tenant, and Tenant shall not be entitled to a rent credit for any portion of the Reimbursement Allowance not utilized by Tenant for the construction of the Tenant’s Work. Any unused portion of the Reimbursement Allowance shall accrue to the sole benefit of Landlord. Any portion of the Reimbursement Allowance not utilized by Tenant on or before the date which is one year following the date of this Lease for the cost of Completion of the Premises shall be forfeited by Tenant and remain the property of Landlord. Prior to the start of construction, Tenant shall submit to Landlord for Landlord’s approval Tenant’s budget breakdown prepared by Tenant’s Contractor.</p>
          <p id="s1p487">B. Landlord shall make progress payments on account of the Tenant’s Work to Tenant as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p488">(i) On or before the 25th of each month, Tenant shall submit to Landlord’s Representative for approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, an invoice for payment for Tenant’s Work completed.</p>
          <p id="s1p489">(ii) Each application for payment shall be for an amount equal to the cost of the Tenant’s Work completed less Tenant’s pro rata share as described below, less retainages held as described below, and less all previous payments. If the total costs of the Tenant’s Work exceed the Reimbursement Allowance, the excess shall be at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, and shall be funded on a pro rata basis, monthly, as construction progresses with each advance by Landlord. Landlord’s pro rata share shall be equal to the percentage obtained by dividing the Reimbursement Allowance by the total estimated cost of the Tenant’s Work (but not to exceed 100%). Tenant’s pro rata share shall equal 100% minus Landlord’s pro rata share.</p>
          <p id="s1p490">(iii) Retainage of ten percent (10%) shall be held with respect to all Tenant’s Work until all requirements of Section 6.D below are satisfied.</p>
          <p id="s1p491">(iv) Within thirty (30) days after the submission of each application for payment to Landlord, the amount thereof, as approved in accordance with Section 6.B(i) above, shall be due and payable by Landlord</p>
          <p id="s1p492">to Tenant. Payments may be made by checks payable to Tenant or jointly payable to Tenant and Contractor (but delivered to Tenant).</p>
          <p id="s1p493">(v) Tenant shall, prior to the payment by Landlord of each application for payment, furnish to Landlord (a) unconditional lien waivers from Tenant’s Contractor, and its suppliers and subcontractors with respect to the Tenant’s Work paid for in the immediately preceding application for payment and (b) conditional lien waivers from Tenant’s Contractor, and its suppliers and subcontractors with respect to the Tenant’s Work covered by the current application for payment.</p>
          <p id="s1p494">(vi) Payment will be made only for work in place, and shall not be made for materials on site but not installed.</p>
          <p id="s1p495">C. Tenant shall pay Landlord a fee for Landlord’s oversight and coordination of Tenant’s Work equal to three percent (3%) of the cost of Completion of the Premises (the “Supervision Fee”). Such fee shall be deducted from the Reimbursement Allowance if sufficient funds are available therefor; otherwise such Supervision Fee shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord’s invoice therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p496">D. Upon receipt of written notice that the Tenant’s Work is ready for final inspection and acceptance, Landlord, Tenant and Tenant’s Contractor will promptly make such inspection and, provided the work is found to be acceptable pursuant to the Premises Plans and Specifications, final payment hereunder shall be promptly made subject to this Section 6. Simultaneously or prior to said payment, Tenant shall cause Tenant’s Contractor to (i) provide “Final Inspection Approval” from the City of Palo Alto, (ii) provide “final” lien releases from all contractors, subcontractors and suppliers, and (iii) provide a final accounting of all Tenant’s Work costs.</p>
          <p id="s1p497">E. Within thirty (30) days after Completion of the Premises, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a complete set of “as built” plans for the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p498">SECTION 7</p>
          <p id="s1p499">RESTORATION</p>
          <p id="s1p500">At the expiration or sooner termination of the Lease Term, all Tenant’s Work shall be surrendered to Landlord as part of the realty; provided, however, as a condition to Landlord’s approval of the Premises Plans and Specifications to any structural improvements or any improvements which are not typical office improvements (including, without limitation, any internal staircases), Landlord may require (by written notice given to Tenant concurrently with Landlord’s approval of the Premises Plans and Specifications) that Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, remove such improvements prior to the expiration or sooner termination of the Term and restore the affected area.</p>
