          <p id="s1p12">1.2 Tenant’s Proportionate Share. The “Tenant’s Proportionate Share” of the Building is projected to be fifty-four and 62/100 percent (54.62%) based on the rentable square footage of the Premises divided by the rentable square footage of the Building. For purposes of the foregoing, “rentable square footage” is defined as the dedicated and usable space within the Premises, plus a pro rata allocation of any common areas. Upon completion of the Building, the Landlord and Tenant shall remeasure the rentable square footage of each demised premises within the building and determine the final Tenant’s Proportionate Share.</p>
          <p id="s1p13">1.3 Use. The Premises are to be used for medical office and ancillary services.</p>
          <p id="s1p14">1.4 Commencement of Term. The date on which Tenant shall take possession of and become responsible for insuring and maintaining the Premises, and further, be obligated to commence payment of Additional Rent (the “Commencement Date”) shall be the date a Certificate of Occupancy is issued (by local governmental entity) for the Building shell (the “Completion Date”).</p>
          <p id="s1p15">1.5 Length of the Term. The term of this Lease is for a period of thirty (30) years (the “Term”) beginning on first day of the month immediately following the Commencement Date and expiring on the last day of the three hundred and sixtieth (360th) month thereafter (the “Expiration Date”).</p>
          <p id="s1p16">ARTICLE 2</p>
          <p id="s1p17">RENT</p>
          <p id="s1p18">2.1 Base Rent. Base rent for the Premises (“Base Rent”) shall be established as soon as possible after the Completion Date based on the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p19">2.1.1 Landlord shall engage an impartial appraiser licensed in Massachusetts specializing in the evaluation of oncology treatment centers, reasonably acceptable to both Landlord and Tenant, who shall determine the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises (“FMV”) based on the terms of this Lease. In addition, Landlord’s independent accountant shall determine and certify to Tenant the total cost of developing the underlying land and constructing the Building and Project (which shall include, but not be limited to, hard and soft construction costs, legal fees for the negotiation of the several leases and related documents, the financing documents, and the construction contract and any related documents, accounting fees, financing costs and any other costs related to the Project), along with any carrying costs, including, but not limited to, any third party debt and insurance premium costs, paid by the Landlord between the Completion Date and the Commencement Date (the “Construction Costs”), which Construction Costs are anticipated to be approximately Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8,500,000.00). The first year’s Base Rent shall be calculated using the higher of (i) the FMV or (ii) the Construction Costs less the Specialty Costs (as hereinafter defined) times the Tenant’s Proportionate Share plus the Specialty Costs times eight and one-half</p>
          <p id="s1p20">2</p>
          <p id="s1p21">percent (8.50%). “Specialty Costs” shall mean (i) the actual and demonstrated costs incurred by Landlord in constructing the Building, Premises and improvements that were necessary specifically for the Building to house a radiation therapy facility, including without limitation, the concrete bunker, wall linings, and other Building design elements for the radiation therapy facility; and, (ii) the actual and demonstrated costs incurred by Landlord in the construction and completion of the Premises in accordance with the requirements of this Lease, which are in excess of the costs which would have been incurred to finish the Premises to the same “shell” level of finish required of Landlord with respect to the Premises covered by the second floor space lease of even date between Landlord and Harrington, which costs are anticipated to be approximately One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00). By way of example only, the Base Rent calculated in accordance with subsection (ii) above utilizing the anticipated costs would be determined as follows: $8,500,000.00 - $1,500,000.00 = $7,050,000.00 x 54.62% = $3,823,400.00 + $1,500,000.00 = $5,323,400.00 x 8.5% = $452,489.00 per annum or $41.32 per gross square foot.</p>
          <p id="s1p22">2.1.2 Upon determination of the FMV, the Construction Costs and the Specialty Costs, the Landlord shall promptly provide the Tenant a copy of the FMV appraisal as well as the Landlord’s accountant’s detailed summary of the calculation of the Construction Costs and the Specialty Costs. The Tenant shall have the right, at its own expense, to retain its own accountant or auditor to review all of the Landlord’s receipts and other proof of expenditures to confirm the calculation of the Construction Costs and the Specialty Costs. If Tenant’s accountant determines that the audited Construction Costs calculation is at variance with the original calculation by Five Percent (5%) or greater, Landlord shall have the option to either (i) average the costs of Landlord’s accounting and Tenant’s accounting; or (ii) electing to have Landlord and Tenant select a mutually acceptable independent auditor who shall be given full access to all of the Landlord’s books and records related to the Construction Costs. The independent auditor’s determination of the actual Construction Costs shall be final; in addition, both Landlord and Tenant shall share the costs of such independent auditor equally.</p>

The estimated figures for taxes and insurance monthly rate will be produced within ten (10) days after the signing of this Lease.

          <p id="s1p150">19.2.1 In all events, any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy shall either expressly assume or reject this Lease within sixty (60) days following the entry of an “Older for Relief” or within such earlier time as may be provided by applicable law.</p>
          <p id="s1p151">19.2.2 In the event of an assumption of this Lease by a debtor or by a trustee, such debtor or trustee shall within fifteen (15) days after such assumption (i) cure any default or provide adequate assurance that defaults will be promptly cured; (ii) compensate Landlord for actual pecuniary loss or provide adequate assurance that compensation will be made for actual monetary loss, including, but not limited to, all attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Landlord resulting from any such proceedings; and (iii) provide adequate assurance of future performance.</p>
          <p id="s1p152">19.2.3 Where a default exists under this Lease, the trustee or debtor assuming this Lease may not require Landlord to provide services or supplies incidental to this Lease before its assumption by such trustee or debtor, unless Landlord is compensated under the terms of this Lease for such services and supplies provided before the assumption of such Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p153">19.2.4 The debtor or trustee may only assign this Lease if (i) it is assumed and the assignee agrees to be bound by this Lease, (ii) adequate assurance of future performance by the assignee is provided, whether or not there has been a default under this Lease, and (iii) the debtor or trustee has received Landlord’s prior written consent pursuant to the provisions of this Lease. Any consideration paid by any assignee in excess of the rental reserved in this Lease shall be the sole property of, and paid to, Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p154">19.2.5 Landlord shall be entitled to the fair market value for the Premises and the services provided by Landlord (but in no event less than the rental reserved in this Lease) subsequent to the commencement of a bankruptcy event.</p>
          <p id="s1p155">19.2.6 Any security deposit given by Tenant to Landlord to secure the future performance by Tenant of all or any of the terms and conditions of this Lease shall be automatically transferred to Landlord upon the entry of an “Order of Relief.”</p>
          <p id="s1p156">19.2.7 The parties agree that Landlord is entitled to adequate assurance of future performance of the terms and provisions of this Lease in the event of an assignment under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. For purposes of any such assumption or assignment of this Lease, the parties agree that the term “adequate assurance” shall include, without limitation, at least the following: (i) any proposed assignee must have, as demonstrated to Landlord’s satisfaction, a net worth (as defined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied) in an amount sufficient to assure that the proposed assignee will have the resources to meet the financial responsibilities under this Lease, including the payment of all Rent; the financial condition and resources of Tenant are material inducements to Landlord entering into this Lease; (ii) any proposed assignee must have engaged in the Use described in Section 1.2 for at least five (5) years prior to any such proposed assignment, the parties hereby acknowledging that in entering into this Lease, Landlord considered extensively Tenant’s</p>
          <p id="s1p157">19</p>
          <p id="s1p158">permitted use and determined that such permitted business would add substantially to the tenant balance in the Premises, and were it not for Tenant’s agreement to operate only Tenant’s permitted business on the Premises, Landlord would not have entered into this Lease, and that Landlord’s operation of the Premises will be materially impaired if a trustee in bankruptcy or any assignee of this Lease operates any business other than Tenant’s permitted business; (iii) any assumption of this Lease by a proposed assignee shall not adversely affect Landlord’s relationship with any of the remaining tenants in the building in which the Premises are located, taking into consideration any and all other “use” clauses and/or “exclusivity” clauses which may then exist under their leases with Landlord; and (iv) any proposed assignee must not be engaged in any business or activity which it will conduct on the Premises and which will subject the Premises to contamination by any Hazardous Materials.</p>
          <p id="s1p159">ARTICLE 20</p>
          <p id="s1p160">LIMITATIONS OF LANDLORD’S LIABILITY</p>
          <p id="s1p161">The term “Landlord” as used in this Lease, so far as covenants or obligations on the part of the Landlord are concerned shall be limited to mean and include only the ground lessee if the named Landlord herein is holding the premises under a ground lease for so long as the named Landlord is the holder of such ground lease interest or the owner or owners of the fee simple of the Premises; and in the event of transfer or transfers of either the ground leasehold interest to any other person or the transfer of title to the fee premises to any person, the Landlord herein named (and in the case of subsequent transfers or conveyances the then grantor or assignor), shall be automatically freed and relieved from and after the date of such transfer or conveyance or assignment of all liability as respects the performance of any covenant or obligation on the part of the Landlord contained in this Lease thereafter to be performed, it being the intention of the parties that the covenants and obligations to be observed and performed by the Landlord shall be binding upon the Landlord only during and in respect of its period of ownership of either a leasehold interest, or a fee interest as the case may be. Anything in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant agrees that Tenant shall, subject to prior rights of any mortgagee or tenant of the Project, look solely to the estate and property of Landlord in the Project for the collection of any judgment (or other judicial process) requiring the payment of money by Landlord in the event of any default or breach by Landlord with respect to any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be observed and/or performed by Landlord, and no other assets of Landlord or any principal of Landlord shall be subject to levy, execution or other procedures for the satisfaction of Tenant’s remedies.</p>
          <p id="s1p162">ARTICLE 21</p>
          <p id="s1p163">ACCESS BY LANDLORD</p>
          <p id="s1p164">Landlord or Landlord’s agents shall have the right to enter the Premises at all reasonable times and, except in the case of emergency, on not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior notice to Tenant, to examine the same and to show them to prospective purchasers of the building, and to make such repairs, alterations, improvements or additions as Landlord may deem necessary or desirable, and Landlord shall be allowed to take all material into and upon said Premises that may be required therefore, without the same constituting an eviction of Tenant in whole or in part and the Rent reserved shall in no way abate while said repairs, alterations, improvements, or</p>
          <p id="s1p165">20</p>
          <p id="s1p166">additions are being made, by reason of loss or interruption of business of Tenant, or otherwise. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be deemed or construed to impose upon Landlord any obligation, responsibility or liability whatsoever, for the care, maintenance, or repair of the Premises or any part thereof, except as otherwise herein specifically provided. Landlord shall give Tenant reasonable notice during business hours prior to any entry. Landlord acknowledges that Tenant is a health care provider subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and in accordance therewith, Tenant is required to maintain the privacy of its patients. Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid contact with such confidential patient records or other information when access to the Premises by Landlord is permitted hereunder, and Landlord shall be accompanied by an agent or employee of Tenant when entering the Premises in accordance with the terms of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p167">ARTICLE 22</p>
          <p id="s1p168">QUIET ENJOYMENT</p>
          <p id="s1p169">22.1 Landlord’s Covenant. Upon payment by the Tenant of the rents and other charges due hereunder, and upon the observance and performance of all of the covenants, terms and conditions on Tenant’s part to be observed and performed, and so long as this Lease is in full force and effect. Tenant shall peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the Premises for the term hereby demised without hindrance or interruption by Landlord or any other person or persons lawfully or equitably claiming by, through or under the Landlord, subject, nevertheless, to the terms and conditions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p170">ARTICLE 23</p>
          <p id="s1p171">MISCELLANEOUS</p>
          <p id="s1p172">23.1 Accord and Satisfaction. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the rent herein stipulated to be paid shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest stipulated rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover the balance of such rent or pursue any other remedy provided herein or by law.</p>
          <p id="s1p173">23.2 Entire Agreement. This Lease constitutes all covenants, promises, agreements, conditions and understandings between Landlord and Tenant concerning the Premises and the Building and there are no covenants, promises, conditions or understandings, either oral or written, between them other than are herein set forth. Neither Landlord nor Landlord’s agents have made nor shall be bound to any representations with respect to the Premises or the Building except as herein expressly set forth, and all representations, either oral or written, shall be deemed to be merged into this Lease.

Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Landlord shall also have the right to give notice to Tenant in any other manner provided by law.</p>

          <p id="s1p207">22</p>
          <p id="s1p208">23.5 Captions and Section Numbers.
