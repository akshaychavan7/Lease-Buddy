If any governmental license or permit shall be required for the proper and lawful conduct of Tenant’s business in the Premises, including the food and beverage Tenant shall, at its expense, duly procure and thereafter maintain such license or permit and shall at all times comply with the terms and conditions of same. Tenant shall not at any time knowingly suffer the Premises to be used or occupied in violation of (i) the Certificate of Occupancy for the Premises or for the Buildings, (ii) any of the provisions of this Lease, or (iii) zoning ordinances, and rules and regulations of governmental and quasi governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p170">5. Base Rental and Early Occupancy Fee.</p>
          <p id="s1p171">(a) Commencing as of April 1, 2005 and continuing throughout the Lease Term, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, without any setoff or deduction, except as provided in this Lease, the Base Rental, and all such other sums of money as shall become due hereunder as Additional Rent, all of which are sometimes herein collectively called “rent” or “Rent.” Base Rental for each calendar year or portion thereof during the Lease Term, together with any applicable adjustment thereto pursuant to Paragraph 6 herein, shall be due and payable in advance, in twelve (12) equal installments on the first day of each calendar month during the Lease Term; provided, however, as set forth in the Lease Summary, Base Rental for the first full calendar month during the Lease Term (the “Advance Base Rental Payment”) shall be due and payable upon the full execution of this Lease. Tenant hereby agrees to pay such Base Rental and any adjustments thereto to Landlord at Landlord’s address provided herein (or such other address as may be designated by Landlord in writing from time to time) monthly, in advance, and without demand.</p>
          <p id="s1p172">(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is contemplated that Tenant shall take occupancy of the Premises in stages. It is assumed that Tenant shall take occupancy of all or a portion of one floor of the Building on the date of Substantial Completion (targeted to be April 25, 2005). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right take occupancy of all or a portion of either of the remaining two floors prior to August 1, 2005 (“Early Occupancy”). In the event of any Early Occupancy, Tenant shall pay Landlord, without any setoff or deduction, the “Early Occupancy Fee” as Additional Rent, all as set forth in Exhibit “C-2” attached hereto. To clarify the foregoing, Tenant shall not be obligated to pay any “Early Occupancy Fee” if Tenant occupies all or a portion of one floor of the building on or after the date of Substantial Completion, whether the date of Substantial Completion occurs prior to April 25 or after April 25, 2005, but shall be obligated to pay the Early Occupancy Fee upon and in the event of Tenant’s occupancy of all or a portion of either of the remaining two floors prior to August 1, 2005.</p>
          <p id="s1p173">4</p>
          <p id="s1p174">6. Adjustments for Increases in Basic Costs.</p>
          <p id="s1p175">The parties each acknowledge that the Base Rent specified in Section 3 of this Lease does not provide for increases in Basic Costs which may hereafter affect the Premises, the Building or the Project; accordingly, from and after the first day of the year following the Base Year and thereafter during the Term of this Lease, and any renewals thereof, Tenant shall pay Landlord as Additional Rent, in the manner hereafter provided, Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the amount by which Basic Costs paid or incurred by Landlord during such period exceeded the Basic Costs Expense Stop. References in this Paragraph 6 to “Basic Costs” shall be deemed and construed to refer to Basic Costs as adjusted pursuant to the immediately following paragraph. If Tenant shall be obligated to make payments as aforesaid with regard to any partial calendar year during the Lease Term, Basic Costs in excess of the Basic Costs Expense Stop shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days during such calendar year for which Tenant is obligated to make such payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Landlord agrees that the “Controllable Portion” of Basic Costs shall not increase by more than four percent (4%) from the Base Year to the following calendar year or between any other calendar years during the Lease Term. For purposes hereof, the “Controllable Portion” of Basic Costs shall mean all Basic Costs less and except real estate taxes, Utility Costs, and insurance.</p>
          <p id="s1p176">It is acknowledged and agreed that it will not be possible to determine the actual amount of the excess (if any) of Basic Costs over the Basic Costs Expense Stop for a given calendar year until after the end of such calendar year. Therefore, until Tenant’s liability for Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Basic Costs in excess of the Basic Costs Expense Stop shall have been finally determined for a particular calendar year, Tenant shall make payment on account of excess Basic Costs as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p177">(a) Commencing as of the first anniversary of the Commencement Date and continuing throughout the Lease Term (and any renewal or extension thereof), and subject to the limitation expressed above, Landlord shall make a good faith estimate of Basic Costs for such calendar year and Tenant’s Proportionate Share thereof (hereinafter “Estimated Basic Costs” and “Tenant’s Estimated Proportionate Share”), and Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent with each monthly installment of Base Rental, an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of Tenant’s Estimated Proportionate Share of the amount by which Estimated Basic Costs for the current calendar year are estimated to exceed the Basic Costs Expense Stop. Such payments for any partial month shall be paid in advance at the daily rate equal to the monthly payment divided by the number of days in the month for which the same is due. On or about January 1 of each calendar year in respect of which Tenant shall be obligated to make payments on account of excess Basic Costs during the Lease Term (and any renewal or extension thereof), Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a statement for such calendar year of Tenant’s Estimated Proportionate Share and of Estimated Basic Costs and thereupon, subject to the limitations expressed above, as of such January 1, Tenant shall make payments under this Paragraph 7(a) in accordance with such statement.</p>
          <p id="s1p178">(b) On or before April 1 (or as soon as practicable thereafter) of each year following a calendar year in which Tenant is obligated to make payments on account of excess Basic Costs during the Lease Term (and any renewal or extension thereof), Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a statement setting forth the total amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the amount by which Basic Costs for the preceding calendar year exceeded the Basic Costs Expense Stop. If any such statement shall show an overpayment or underpayment of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of excess Basic Costs for the preceding calendar year, any overpayment shall be refunded to Tenant, provided Tenant is not in default under the terms of this Lease, or otherwise such overpayment shall be credited against payments due from Tenant under this Lease. The full amount of any underpayment shall be paid to Landlord by Tenant not later than the first day of the first calendar month after such statement shall have been delivered to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p179">5</p>
          <p id="s1p180">7. Sales Tax. Tenant shall be liable and pay to Landlord all rental, sales and use taxes, if any, levied or imposed by any city, state, county or other governmental body having authority, on Base Rental, the Early Occupancy Fee, Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the amount by which Basic Costs paid or incurred by Landlord during such period exceeded the Basic Costs Expense Stop, and any other Additional Rental or other fees or charges due to Landlord, such payments to be in addition to all other payments required to be paid to Landlord by Tenant under the terms of this Lease. Any such payment shall be paid concurrently with the payment of the Rent or other charge upon which the tax is based as set forth herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p181">8. Services to Be Furnished by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p182">Landlord agrees to furnish Tenant the following services:</p>
          <p id="s1p183">(a) Hot and cold water at those points of supply as specified in the plans for the Tenant Improvements and to the lavatories in the Common Area restrooms, and cold water to water fountains and to the toilets in the Common Area restrooms.</p>
          <p id="s1p184">(b) Electrical service to serve the Common Areas and the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p185">(c) Routine and scheduled or continuous (as appropriate) maintenance and electric and lighting service for all Common Areas and the Premises in the manner and to the extent usual and customary for Class A office buildings located in the Tampa Bay area. Landlord agrees to provide maintenance service to the Building with the services of a property management company having experience with Class A commercial properties and which shall be dedicated to furnishing services on-site throughout Carillon Park.</p>
          <p id="s1p186">(d) Exterior window washing (not less than three times in any calendar year) and routine pest control, landscaping maintenance, and janitorial service (Mondays through Fridays, exclusive of normal business holidays) and otherwise in the manner and to the extent usual and customary for Class A office buildings in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
          <p id="s1p187">(e) All Building standard fluorescent and incandescent light bulb replacement in the Common Areas and all light bulb replacement in the Premises; provided, however, Tenant shall promptly pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, costs incurred by Landlord in replacing light bulbs in the Premises (including the cost of purchasing such light bulbs) if and to the extent such replacement cost exceeds the replacement cost for Building standard light bulbs.</p>
          <p id="s1p188">(f) Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant, its employees, agents, invitees or licensees for losses due to theft or burglary or for damages done by unauthorized persons on the Premises, and Landlord shall not be required to insure against any such losses. Tenant shall cooperate fully with Landlord’s efforts to maintain controlled access to and in the Building during times other than Normal Business Hours and shall follow all regulations promulgated by Landlord with respect thereto. Tenant may maintain an on-site security service consisting of a desk manned by a licensed security guard located on the ground floor of the Building to govern and monitor ingress and egress to the Premises, only; provided however, Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless of and from any and all losses, claims or damage incurred by Landlord that may result from Tenant’s security employees or agents impeding or limiting, in any fashion, any ingress and egress of Landlord or other tenants, and their respective agents, employees, licensees and invitees, to and from such tenants’ premises and the Common Areas.</p>
          <p id="s1p189">6</p>
          <p id="s1p190">(g) Except with regard to any heat that may be generated by specialized heat-generating machine or equipment (all normal and customary office equipment associated with general office use and operations center being excluded) and which may affect the temperature otherwise maintained by the Building HVAC, the accommodation of which shall not be Landlord’s responsibility and shall be Tenant’s responsibility pursuant to Paragraph 11(b) herein, Landlord shall furnish central heat and air conditioning sufficient for the comfortable occupancy of the Premises. Provided, however, central heating and air conditioning service at times other than for “Normal Business Hours” for the Building (which are 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays and 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays, exclusive of normal business holidays identified as New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day), shall be furnished only on the written request of Tenant delivered to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p191">Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Tenant shall bear the entire cost (as Additional Rent) of such additional heating and air conditioning used by Tenant at times other than Normal Business Hours, and Tenant shall pay such costs within thirty (30) days following demand by Landlord. The cost to be charged by Landlord to Tenant hereunder for heating and air conditioning service used by Tenant during times other than Normal Business Hours shall be Landlord’s then “standard charge” for such service, which Landlord agrees currently is $30.00 per hour per floor of the Building. Landlord agrees to provide Tenant with an annual reconciliation report reflecting Landlord’s actual cost to prove after hours HVAC service. In the event that the amount paid by Landlord to the local electrical utility company for electricity supplied for after-hours HVAC as reflected by the reconciliation report for any given period of time is greater than the amount paid by Tenant as the “standard charge” for after-hours for the relevant period of time, Landlord may submit an invoice to Tenant periodically for the cost of such excess electricity supplied and Tenant shall pay the full invoiced amount (as Additional Rent) to Landlord within ten (10) days after Tenant’s receipt of each such invoice. In the event that the amount paid by Landlord to the local electrical utility company for electricity supplied for after-hours HVAC as reflected by the reconciliation report for any given period of time is less than the amount paid by Tenant as the “standard charge” for after-hours for the relevant period of time, Landlord will credit such overage against the rent payment next due to Landlord. In addition, Landlord may adjust its standard charge to reflect the actual costs as so reflected in the reconciliation report.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">(h) The failure by Landlord to any extent to furnish, or the interruption or termination of these defined services in whole or in part, resulting from any Force Majeure Matters or from any other causes beyond the reasonable control of Landlord shall not (i) render Landlord liable in any respect, (ii) be construed as an eviction of Tenant, (iii) work an abatement of rent, or (iv) relieve Tenant from the obligation to fulfill any covenant or agreement in this Lease. Should any of the equipment or machinery used in the provision of such services for any cause cease to function properly, Tenant shall have no claim for offset or abatement of rent or damages on account of an interruption in service resulting therefrom. Amounts payable pursuant to this Paragraph 8 shall be deemed to be Additional Rent due from Tenant to Landlord, and any default in the payment thereof shall entitle Landlord to all remedies provided for herein at law or in equity on account of Tenant’s failure to pay Base Rental.</p>
          <p id="s1p193">(i) Landlord shall have the right with regard to any and all maintenance obligations of Landlord under this Lease, to contract with such person(s) or entity or entities for the performance and accomplishment of such of the obligations as Landlord shall deem proper, including entities in which Landlord may hold an ownership or other interest, provided that such property management company is an experienced Class A property management company. Landlord may incur certain operating,</p>
          <p id="s1p194">7</p>
          <p id="s1p195">management and maintenance obligations, costs and expenses pertaining to the Premises, together with or in combination with Landlord’s operations, repair, management and maintenance of other properties located in the same development park or project. To the extent such costs and expenses are shared costs or jointly billed to Landlord, Landlord agrees that it shall apportion the costs and expenses among the Premises and the other properties subject to such services, repair or maintenance in a fair and equitable fashion. Landlord must provide a detailed or itemized accounting of shared costs upon written request of Tenant, but not more frequently than once every six months and only within two years following Landlord’s statement or billing for such shared costs. If Tenant, in good faith, disputes such charges, Tenant must notify Landlord within three months following its receipt of the detailed accounting therefore and all disputed sums shall be deposited in escrow, pending resolution of such dispute. The parties agree to submit any disputes to arbitration if not resolved within 15 days.</p>
          <p id="s1p196">9. Construction of Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p197">(a) Subject to Force Majeure Matters (as that term is defined in Paragraph 41 herein) and consistent with the terms of Paragraph 3 herein and Exhibit D hereto, Landlord shall pursue diligently and in good faith the completion of the Tenant Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p198">The Tenant Improvements Allowance shall be applied by Landlord against the costs of designing, planning and constructing the Tenant Improvements. In the event the costs incurred in connection with the design, planning and construction of the Tenant Improvements exceed the Tenant Improvements Allowance, Tenant covenants that it shall pay to Landlord all of such excess costs (the “Excess Costs”) on or prior to the date of Substantial Completion. Landlord must provide a detailed or itemized accounting of Excess Costs upon demand and Tenant may, in good faith, dispute any charges for work or costs not previously approved by Tenant. Any and all sums subject to a good faith dispute by Tenant shall be deposited in escrow pending resolution of the same. The parties agree to submit any and all disputes to arbitration in the event the same remain unresolved within 15 days.</p>
          <p id="s1p199">The Excess Costs (if any) payable by Tenant under this Paragraph 9 shall be due hereunder at the time specified hereinabove, and failure to make any such payment (less and except disputed charges) when due shall constitute an Event of Default of Tenant under Paragraph 28 herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p200">(b) Except as otherwise provided above in this Paragraph 9, all installations and improvements now or hereafter placed on or in the Premises shall be for Tenant’s account and at Tenant’s cost. Tenant shall also pay ad valorem taxes and increased insurance on or attributable to the Tenant Improvements (to the extent of the cost of the Tenant Improvements is in excess of the Tenant Improvements Allowance), which cost shall be payable by Tenant to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p201">10.Maintenance and Repair by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p202">Except to the extent any such repairs or replacements are the responsibility of Tenant pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 11 or Paragraph 12 herein or any other provision in this Lease, Landlord shall be responsible for maintaining, repairing and replacing, as an item of Basic Costs subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease:</p>
          <p id="s1p203">(a) the roof, foundations, exterior walls, and all structural parts of the Building;</p>

          <p id="s1p205">(b) all portions of the Premises affected by structural conditions whose source lies outside the Premises;</p>
          <p id="s1p206">(c) all Common Areas, including Building Exterior Common Areas;</p>
          <p id="s1p207">(d) all utility, sprinkler service, electrical and plumbing lines and general HVAC systems outside the Premises but which serve the Premises on; and</p>
          <p id="s1p208">(e) all Building fixtures and equipment owned by Landlord, including but not limited to utility, sprinkler service, electrical and plumbing lines and HVAC systems within the Premises, but not including any of Tenant’s fixtures or equipment or other personal property.</p>
          <p id="s1p209">11. Maintenance and Repair by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p210">In addition to any other provisions in this Lease which obligate Tenant to perform maintenance, repair and replacement duties relative to the Premises and/or the Building, Tenant shall be responsible for the following maintenance, repair and replacement responsibilities:</p>
          <p id="s1p211">(a) Tenant shall, at its expense, keep and maintain the Premises in good order and repair and not commit or allow any waste to be committed on any portion of the Premises; and at the termination of this Lease, Tenant agrees to deliver up the Premises to Landlord in as good of a condition as existed on the Commencement Date, excepting only reasonable wear and tear, acts of God and repairs required to be made by Landlord pursuant to the terms of this Lease (it being understood that notwithstanding the foregoing, the flooring on the second and third floors, only, of the Building may be re-delivered in “broom-clean” condition). All repairs and replacements made by Tenant shall be equal in quality and class to the originals thereof and shall be completed in compliance with applicable law. If Tenant fails to make the repairs or replacements, in an emergency promptly after notice, or otherwise fails to make the repairs or replacements within thirty (30) days after notice or in the event that such repair or replacement is of such a nature as cannot with diligent effort be cured within said thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall have failed to commence to cure within said period or failed to diligently prosecute remedial efforts to completion within a reasonable time thereafter, then Landlord may, at its option, make the repairs or replacements, and the cost of such repairs or replacements shall be charged to Tenant as Additional Rent and shall become payable by Tenant with the payment of the rent next due hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p212">(b) If Tenant elects to install its own separate and exclusive HVAC systems and units in order to accommodate excessive heat generated by any of Tenant’s specialized heat-generating machinery or equipment, Tenant shall, at its expense, cause such HVAC systems and units to be maintained, together with any other specialized appliances and equipment owned or installed by Tenant and that serve Tenant or the Premises (or any portion thereof). In the event the Premises (or any portion thereof) is exclusively served by an HVAC system or unit for such specialized equipment or machinery, Tenant shall contract with a qualified heating and air conditioning service company approved by Landlord for the monthly maintenance and the repair and replacement, as necessary, of such HVAC system or unit. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a copy of any contract required under this Paragraph 11(b) within ten (10) days after the Commencement Date and a copy of any subsequent contracts (or any renewal contracts) within ten (10) days after their execution. The cost of all contracts which Tenant is required to maintain under this Paragraph 11(b) shall be borne by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p213">9</p>
          <p id="s1p214">(c) Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses incurred by Landlord to repair or replace any damage done to the Common Areas, the Building, or any part thereof (including the Premises), caused by Tenant or Tenant’s agents, employees, invitees, or visitors. Any and all such repairs or replacements shall be effected in compliance with all applicable laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p215">(d) Landlord agrees that to the extent any necessary repairs or replacements are covered by one or more warranties furnished or to be furnished to Landlord in connection with the Tenant Improvements to be performed as contemplated by Exhibit D attached hereto, Landlord shall use diligent effort to enforce such warranties.</p>
          <p id="s1p216">12. Alterations by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p217">Tenant shall not make or allow to be made any alterations to the Premises or install any vending machines in the Premises, without first obtaining the written consent of Landlord in each such instance. Any and all alterations to the Premises, including, without limitation the Tenant Improvements, shall become the property of Landlord upon the termination of this Lease (except for personal property and furniture owned by Tenant).</p>
          <p id="s1p218">13. Landlord’s Reservation of Common Areas and Right of Further Development.</p>
          <p id="s1p219">Landlord shall retain control over the Common Areas in the Building (to the extent located on the first floor, and all vertical penetrations, and the roof and reserving the right to reasonably access the roof) and all Building Exterior Common Areas and shall operate and maintain all Common Areas in such manner as Landlord in its reasonable discretion, shall determine. Without limitation to the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right to construct either an expansion to the Building or to construct another building or parking facility on the Land, as more particularly provided for hereinafter. Landlord agrees that it shall consult with Tenant prior to the exercise of any such control to the extent it would impact Tenant’s use and enjoyment of such Common Areas. Tenant acknowledges that, without any liability to Tenant in any respect, Landlord shall have the right to:</p>
          <p id="s1p220">(a) Close off any of the Common Areas to whatever extent required, in the opinion of Landlord, to prevent a dedication of any of the Common Areas or the accrual of any rights by any person or the public to the Common Areas, provided such closure does not materially deprive Tenant of the benefit and enjoyment of the Premises for its permitted use;</p>
          <p id="s1p221">(b) Except as expressly provided herein, temporarily close not more than fifty percent, at any given time, of the total of the Common Areas (but not more than 90 days in the aggregate for every two year period) for maintenance, alteration, further site development or improvement purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of further site development by Landlord, Landlord shall be entitled to utilized all or any portion of the Building Exterior Common Areas for staging and/or as the site for an additional building or parking facility to be located either on or adjacent to the Land; provided that Landlord continuously provides Tenant with not less than 300 parking spaces on or in the vicinity of the Land during such construction period (provided, however, in the event that such relocated spaces are located at a distance greater than the distance between the Building and the “Town Center Off-Site Parking” (as defined in Paragraph 13, below), then Landlord agrees that it shall furnish a free shuttle service (during Tenant’s standard business hours of arrival and departure) to the employees of Tenant between such off-site parking location and the Building;</p>
          <p id="s1p222">(c) Select, appoint or contract with any person for the purpose of operating and maintaining the Common Areas, on such terms and conditions as Landlord deems reasonable;</p>
          <p id="s1p223">10</p>
          <p id="s1p224">(d) Change the size, use, shape or nature of any such Common Areas (including any of the Building Exterior Common Area and any other Common Area located on the first floor of the Building and the roof top) provided such change does not materially deprive Tenant of the benefit and enjoyment of the Premises and further provided that such change does not increase Tenant’s Proportionate Share for purposes of any rental calculations hereunder. So long as Tenant is not thus deprived of the use and benefit of the Premises or adequate parking or access to the Premises, and is not deprived of toilet facilities within the Building, Landlord will also have the right at any time to change the arrangement or location of, or both, or to regulate or eliminate the use of any concourse, elevator, stairs, toilet or other public conveniences in the Building, or any driveways or parking facility, without incurring any liability to Tenant or entitling Tenant to any abatement of rent;</p>
          <p id="s1p225">(e) Expand the existing Building or other Building, whether or not the same covers a portion of the Common Areas, convert the Common Areas to a portion of the Building or other building, or convert any portion of the Building (excluding the Premises) or other building to Common Areas. Upon erection or any Building or expansion of the Building, or change in Common Areas, the portion of the Building upon which such structures have been erected will no longer be deemed to be a part of the Common Areas. In the event of any such changes in the size or use of a building or Common Areas, Landlord may make an appropriate adjustment in the Rentable Square Feet of the Building and a corresponding adjustment to Tenant’s Proportionate Share;</p>
          <p id="s1p226">(f) In addition to the other rights of Landlord under this Lease, Landlord reserves to itself and its respective successors and assigns the right to: (i) change the street address and/or name of the Building; (ii) erect, use and maintain pipes and conduits in and through the Premises; (iii) grant to anyone the exclusive right to conduct any lawful business or undertaking in the Building; (iv) control the use of the roof and exterior walls of the Building and other Building Exterior Common Area; and (vi) use Tenant’s name in promotional materials relating to the Building. Landlord may exercise any or all of the foregoing rights without being deemed to be guilty of an eviction or disturbance or interruption of the business of Tenant or Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, provided that Landlord uses reasonable efforts to minimize interference with Tenant’s benefit and enjoyment of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p227">(g) Nothing in this Paragraph 13 is intended to negate or nullify the rights granted to Tenant in Exhibit F, Sections 3 and 4.</p>
          <p id="s1p228">14. Graphics and Signage.</p>
          <p id="s1p229">All letters and numerals on doors or other signs on the Premises shall be in the standard form of graphics for the Building, and no others shall be used or permitted without Landlord’s prior written consent. Furthermore, except as expressly permitted herein, Tenant shall not place signs on or in the Premises which are visible from outside the Premises. Tenant’s name and suite number shall be included by Landlord on the lobby directory for the Building and at the main entry for the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord will permit Tenant to install lighted signage on the Building, either in the form of the existing lighted sign currently installed on the Pasco Building, or be a new channel mounted lighted sign approximately the same size. Any new signage installation, including the size and scope, shall be subject to both Landlord’s and Tenant’s prior written approval, and furthermore, shall be permitted only upon governmental approval and shall comply with all governmental ordinances, codes and regulations. The cost of the building signage is the sole responsibility of Tenant and may be funded from the Tenant Improvement Allowance.</p>
          <p id="s1p230">11</p>
          <p id="s1p231">15. Parking.</p>
          <p id="s1p232">During the Lease Term, Tenant shall have, without charge, the non-exclusive right to use, in common with Landlord, other tenants of the Building, and their respective guests and invitees, the automobile parking areas, driveways, and footways located on the Land. Notwithstanding the terms and provisions in the immediately preceding sentence, (i) Tenant and Tenant’s guests and invitees shall not, at any given time, be entitled to use more than three hundred (300) non-exclusive parking spaces, and (ii) Landlord shall have the right during the Lease Term to reserve parking spaces on the Land for the exclusive use of other tenants in the Building, provided the reservation of such spaces for the exclusive use of other tenants in the Building does not have the effect of denying Tenant the non-exclusive use of 300 parking spaces. Without limitation to the foregoing, Landlord shall mark all parking spaces that shall be for the exclusive use of the tenant of Suite 100, under the existing “Byrd Lease” (as defined in Exhibit “F” attached hereto). In addition, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with an additional fifty (50) non-exclusive parking spaces (“Off-Site Parking”) at either: (a) a parking site located at the southerly portion of the Town Center development (“Town Center Off-Site Parking”); or (b) at an alternative location within Carillon Office Park, provided, however, that Landlord agrees that it shall furnish a free shuttle service (during Tenant’s standard business hours of arrival and departure) to the employees of Tenant between such alternative location and the Building in the event that such alternative location is located outside of a diameter having a distance radius equal to the distance between the Building and the Town Center Off-Site Parking. The Off-Site Parking shall be furnished to Tenant without additional costs for the first three years of the term of this Lease. Thereafter, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord a monthly fee equal to $30.00 per parking space for the Off-Site Parking, plus applicable sales tax, during the fourth year of the term of this Lease. Thereafter, the Off-Site Parking fee shall be increased annually by an amount equal to 1.5% of the previous year’s parking fee rate.</p>

          <p id="s1p240">(b) Landlord has the right to cause the evacuation of the Building in the event of any emergency or catastrophe.

          <p id="s1p241">(c) Notwithstanding the terms of the preceding subparagraph 18(b), Landlord shall have the right to cause the evacuation of the Building in the event of a hurricane, but such right shall be subject to and conditioned upon the issuance of: (i) a hurricane warning issued by the National Hurricane Center or National Weather Service for the evacuation zone in which the Building is located; and/or (ii) a mandatory order to evacuate the evacuation zone in which the Building is located by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction to order such evacuations in the event of an approaching hurricane (collectively the “Official Order”). Notwithstanding anything in this Paragraph 18 to the contrary, in the event that Tenant fails to evacuate the Building on or before the time set by the Official Order (the “Evacuation Deadline”), with or without a concurrent order of Landlord to evacuate, and provided Tenant’s failure to evacuate the Building by the Evacuation Deadline is not the result of any actions or negligence of Landlord and/or its agents and employees, then Tenant assumes all risk and liability, including any increases in insurance costs to Landlord, and hereby releases and waives all claims against Landlord from injury, death, loss or damage to person, property or business sustained in or about the Premises or the Building (including Tenant’s personal property and equipment) that arises directly from Tenant’s failure to evacuate the Building by the Evacuation Deadline.

In the event Landlord shall be made a party to any litigation regarding or arising from Tenant’s failure to comply with the Evacuation Deadline, then Tenant shall protect and hold Landlord harmless and pay all costs and attorney’s fees incurred by Landlord in connection with such litigation, and any appeals thereof. Tenant shall have the right to suspend payment of any fine or penalty imposed during the period of time Tenant shall have the legal right to contest, in good faith, the imposition of any such fine or penalty, however, Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold</p>

          <p id="s1p245">(a) Tenant shall not, by operation of law or otherwise, (a) assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber this Lease, the Premises or any part of or interest in this Lease or the Premises, (b) grant any concession or license within the Premises, (c) sublet all or any part of the Premises or any right or privilege appurtenant to the Premises, or (d) permit any other party to occupy or use all or any part of the Premises (collectively, a “Transfer”), without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond 10 business days after receipt by Landlord of all required information reflecting the terms of the Transfer, as set forth hereinabelow. This prohibition against a Transfer includes, without limitation, except as otherwise set forth herein, (i) any subletting or assignment which would otherwise occur by operation of law, merger, consolidation, reorganization, transfer or other change of Tenant’s corporate or proprietary structure; (ii) an assignment or subletting to or by a receiver or trustee in any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, or other proceedings; (iii) the sale, assignment or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant, with or without specific assignment of Lease; (iv) the change in control in a partnership; or (v) conversion of Tenant to a limited liability entity. If Tenant converts to a limited liability entity without obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord: (i) the conversion shall be null and void for purposes of the Lease, including the determination of all obligations and liabilities of Tenant and its partners to Landlord; (ii) all partners of Tenant immediately prior to its conversion to a limited liability shall be fully liable, jointly and severally, for obligations of Tenant accruing under this Lease pre-conversion and post-conversion, and all members and other equity holders in Tenant post-conversion shall be fully liable for all obligations and liabilities of Tenant accruing under the Lease after the date such members and other equity holders are admitted to the limited liability entity as if such person or entity had become a general partner in a partnership; and (iii) Landlord shall have the option of declaring Tenant in default under this Lease.

If Landlord should fail to notify Tenant in writing of its decision within a thirty (30) day period after Landlord is notified in writing of the proposed assignment, sublease or other transfer, Landlord shall be deemed to have refused to consent to such assignment, sublease or transfer and to have elected to keep this Lease in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p247">(c) Landlord hereby reserves the right to condition Landlord’s consent to any assignment or sublet upon Landlord’s receipt from Tenant of a written agreement, in form and substance acceptable to Landlord, pursuant to which Tenant, at Landlord’s option, shall pay over to Landlord, as Additional Rent</p>

          <p id="s1p250">(d) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Tenant may assign this Lease or sublet the Premises without Landlord’s consent (i) to any corporation or other entity resulting from a merger, acquisition, consolidation of or with Tenant; or (ii) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Tenant; or (iii) to any Affiliate (as that term is defined in this Paragraph 19(h)) of Tenant, so long as Tenant provides evidence to Landlord in writing that such assignment or sublease complies with the criteria set forth in (i) or (ii) above and provided the following conditions are met: (1) the net worth of the transferee is equal to or greater than the greater of Tenant’s net worth on the date of this Lease and Tenant’s net worth immediately prior to the effective date of the transfer, (2) if Tenant remains in existence as a separate legal entity following the transfer, it shall not be released from liability under this Lease, (3) the transferee shall assume in a writing delivered to Landlord all of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease effective upon the consummation of the transfer, and (4) Tenant shall give written notice to Landlord of the proposed transfer at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the consummation thereof. As used herein, “Affiliate” shall mean any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, Tenant. Any subsequent Transfer by such Affiliate shall be subject to Landlord’s prior written consent (which Landlord may grant or deny in accordance with this Paragraph 19).</p>
          <p id="s1p251">(e) If Tenant assigns, sublets or makes any other transfer of all or any portion of its interest(s) hereunder, Tenant named in this Lease shall remain directly and primarily responsible for the faithful performance and observance of all of the covenants and obligations on Tenant’s part to be performed in this Lease. No assignment or subletting shall affect the continuing primary liability of Tenant hereunder (which, following any assignment or sublet, shall be joint and several with the assignee or subtenant), and Tenant shall not be released from performing any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p252">(f) Any assignee or subtenant hereunder shall be bound by and shall comply with all of the terms and provisions in this Lease, including, without limitation, the use restriction set forth in Paragraph 4 herein. As a condition to the effectiveness of any assignment that is permitted hereunder, the assignee shall, by an instrument in writing, assume and agree to perform (for the express benefit of Landlord) the terms hereof; and as a condition to the effectiveness of any sublease that is permitted hereunder, the subtenant shall acknowledge in writing (for the express benefit of Landlord) the existence of this Lease and shall covenant not to do or permit to be done anything that would constitute a breach hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">(g) Landlord’s consent to any Transfer hereunder shall not waive the requirement of its consent to any subsequent Transfer as required herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p254">(h) Tenant covenants that it shall exclusively use the services of Echelon Real Estate Services, LLC (as exclusive agent for Tenant) or its successors or assigns, to market this Lease or any portions of the Premises for subleasing, to third parties. Further, no assignment or subletting shall be made to any person or entity for the conduct of business which is not in keeping with the standards and general character of the Building and appropriate credit standing. All rights and options of Tenant hereunder, if any, to expand the Premises, contract the Premises, extend or renew the Term, shorten the Term, and any right of first refusal shall automatically terminate upon the assignment of this Lease or upon sublet of all or any part of the Premises unless Landlord specifically agrees in writing that such</p>
          <p id="s1p255">15</p>
          <p id="s1p256">rights and options shall continue. Tenant acknowledges that the restrictions on assignments and subleases described herein are a material inducement for Landlord entering into this Lease and shall be enforceable by Landlord against Tenant and against any assignee or subtenant or any other party acquiring an interest in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p257">20. Liens.</p>
          <p id="s1p258">Tenant will not permit any mechanic’s lien(s) or other liens to be placed upon the Premises, the Building or the Land and nothing in this Lease shall be deemed or construed in any way as constituting the consent or request of Landlord, express or implied, by inference or otherwise, to any person for the performance of any labor or the furnishing of any materials to the Premises, or any part thereof, nor as giving Tenant any right, power or authority to contract for or permit the rendering of any services or the furnishing of any materials that would give rise to any mechanics’ or other liens against the Premises, the Building or the Land. In the event any such lien is attached to the Premises, the Building or the Land, then, in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord, Landlord may, but shall not be obliged to, discharge the same. Any amount paid by Landlord for any of the aforesaid purposes shall be reimbursed by Tenant to Landlord on demand as Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p259">The interest of Landlord shall not be subject to liens for improvements made by Tenant in and to the Premises. Tenant shall notify every contractor making such improvements of the provisions set forth in the preceding sentence of this paragraph. The parties agree, should Landlord so request, to execute, acknowledge and deliver without charge to Tenant, a Short Form Lease in recordable form in accordance with Chapter 713, Florida Statutes containing a confirmation that the interest of Landlord shall not be subject to liens for improvements made by Tenant to the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p260">21. Landlord’s Insurance.</p>
          <p id="s1p261">Landlord shall maintain property insurance on the Building and the Premises, such policy or policies to cover Landlord’s interest in the Building and Premises in amounts and in coverages considered by Landlord to be reasonable and customary. Such insurance shall be maintained at the expense of Landlord (as a part of Basic Costs), and payments for losses thereunder shall be made solely to Landlord or the mortgagees of Landlord relative to the Land and the Building (collectively, “Mortgagees”; each, a “Mortgagee”), as their respective interests shall appear. The insurance required to be obtained by Landlord may be obtained by Landlord through blanket or master policies insuring other entities or properties owned or controlled by Landlord, Landlord shall furnish to Tenant, upon request of Tenant, a certificate or certificates of insurance certifying that the insurance coverage required is in force.</p>
          <p id="s1p262">22. Tenant’s Insurance.</p>
          <p id="s1p263">Tenant shall maintain, at its expense, in an amount equal to full replacement cost, property insurance on all of its personal property, including removable trade fixtures, located in the Premises to be written on a “Special Form” basis. Tenant shall also, at its own expense, maintain a policy or policies of commercial general liability insurance (occurrence coverage) with respect to the respective activities of Tenant on the Land and in the Building with the premiums thereon fully paid on or before the due date, issued by and binding upon an insurance company authorized to conduct such business in the State of Florida.

All policies required to be maintained by Tenant under this Paragraph 22 herein shall name Landlord and its Mortgagee as an additional insured and shall contain a provision whereby the insurer is not allowed to cancel, fail to renew or change materially the coverage without first giving thirty (30) days prior written notice to Landlord. Tenant shall furnish to Landlord, upon request of Landlord, a certificate or certificates of insurance certifying that the insurance coverage required is in force.</p>
          <p id="s1p266">23. Indemnity.</p>
          <p id="s1p267">Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant, or to Tenant’s agents, servants, employees, customers, or invitees for any injury to person or damage to property caused by any act, omission, or neglect of Tenant, its agents, servants, employees, invitees, licensees or any other person entering the Land, the Building Exterior Common Areas, the Building or the Premises under the invitation of Tenant or arising out of a default by Tenant in the performance of its obligations hereunder. Tenant hereby indemnifies and holds Landlord, its officers, directors, agents, employees and invitees harmless from all liability and claims for any such damage or injury. In case Landlord shall be made a party to any such litigation, then Tenant shall protect and hold Landlord harmless and pay all reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred by Landlord in connection with such litigation, and any appeals thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p268">Tenant shall not be liable to Landlord, or to Landlord’s agents, servants, employees, customers, or invitees for any injury to person or damage to property to the extent caused by any act, omission, or neglect of Landlord, its agents, servants, employees, invitees, licensees or by any other person entering the Land, the Building Exterior Common Areas, the Building or the Premises under the express invitation of Landlord, or arising out of a default by Landlord in the performance of its obligations hereunder.

          <p id="s1p270">24. Waiver and Waiver of Subrogation Rights.</p>
          <p id="s1p271">Anything in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding (including, without limitation, Paragraph 23 herein), Landlord and Tenant each hereby waive any and all rights of recovery, claim, action, or cause of action, against the other, its agents, officers, or employees, for any loss or damage that may occur to the Premises or a part thereof, or any improvements thereto, or any personal property of such party therein, by reason of fire, the elements, or any other cause(s) which are insured against under the terms of the property insurance policies referred to in Paragraph 21 and Paragraph 22 herein, regardless of cause or origin, including negligence of the other party hereto, its agents, officers, or employees. All insurance policies carried with respect to Paragraph 21 and Paragraph 22 herein, if permitted under applicable law, shall contain a provision whereby the insurer waives, prior to loss, all rights of subrogation against Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p272">25. Casualty Damage.</p>
          <p id="s1p273">If the Premises or any part thereof shall be damaged by fire or other casualty, Tenant shall give prompt written notice thereof to Landlord. In case the Building shall be so damaged that substantial alteration or reconstruction of the Building shall be required (whether or not the Premises shall have been damaged by such casualty) or in the event any Mortgagee should require that the insurance proceeds payable as a result of a casualty be applied to the payment of the mortgage debt or in the event of any material uninsured loss to the Building, Landlord may, at its option, terminate this Lease by notifying Tenant in writing of such termination within ninety (90) days after the date of such casualty. If, by reason of such casualty, the Premises are rendered untenantable in some material portion, and the amount of time required to repair the damage is reasonably determined by Landlord to be in excess of two hundred forty (240) days from the date upon which Landlord is required to determine whether to terminate this Lease, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving Landlord written notice of termination within thirty (30) days after the date Landlord delivers Tenant notice that the amount of time required to repair the damage has been determined by Landlord to be in excess of two hundred forty (240) days. If Landlord (or Tenant, if applicable) does not thus elect to terminate this Lease, Landlord shall commence and proceed with reasonable diligence to restore the Building to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the occurrence of the casualty, except that Landlord’s obligation to restore shall not exceed the scope of the work required to be done by Landlord in originally constructing the Building Shell Improvements and installing the Tenant Improvements in the Premises. Landlord shall not be obligated to restore the Building Shell Improvements or the Premises if the cost of the restoration work required under this Lease and all other leases of space in the Building exceeds the insurance proceeds actually received by Landlord as a result of the casualty. When the Tenant Improvements have been restored by Landlord, Tenant shall restore Tenant’s furniture and equipment. Landlord shall not be liable for any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or injury to the business of Tenant resulting in any way from such damage or the repair thereof, except that, subject to the provisions of the next sentence, Landlord shall equitably abate the Base Rental during the time and to the extent the Premises are unfit for occupancy and Tenant does not, in fact, use such Premises. If the Premises or any other portion of the Building is damaged by fire or other casualty resulting from the fault or negligence of Tenant or any of Tenant’s agents, employees, or invitees, the Base Rental hereunder shall not be abated during the repair of such damage and Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for the cost of the repair and restoration of the Building caused thereby to the extent such cost and expense are not covered by insurance proceeds.</p>
          <p id="s1p274">18</p>
          <p id="s1p275">26. Condemnation.</p>
          <p id="s1p276">If the whole or substantially the whole of the Building or the Premises should be taken for any public or quasi-public use, by right of eminent domain or otherwise or should be sold in lieu of condemnation, then this Lease shall terminate as of the date when physical possession of the Building or the Premises is taken by the condemning authority. If less than the whole or substantially the whole of the Building or Premises is thus taken or sold and the remaining portion of the Building can no longer be operated as a multi-tenant office building on a financially sound basis, in Landlord’s sole opinion, or if any Mortgagee should require that the condemnation proceeds payable as a result of such taking or sale be applied to the payment of the mortgage debt, Landlord (whether or not the Premises are affected by the taking or sale) may terminate this Lease by giving written notice thereof to Tenant, in which event this Lease shall terminate as of the date when physical possession of such portion of the Building or Premises is taken by the condemning authority. If this Lease is not so terminated upon any such taking or sale and if a portion of the Premises is affected thereby, the Base Rental payable hereunder shall be equitably abated, and Landlord shall, to the extent Landlord deems feasible, restore the Building and the Premises to substantially their former condition, except Landlord’s obligation to restore shall not exceed the scope of the work required to be done by Landlord in originally constructing the Building Shell Improvements and installing the Tenant Improvements, nor shall Landlord in any event be obligated to restore the Building Shell Improvements or the Tenant Improvements if the cost of the restoration work required under this Lease and all other leases of space in the Building exceeds the amount received by Landlord for such taking. All amounts awarded upon a taking of any part or all of the Building or the Premises shall belong to Landlord, and Tenant shall not be entitled to and expressly waives all claims to any such compensation.</p>
          <p id="s1p277">27. Damages from Certain Causes.</p>
          <p id="s1p278">Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage to any property or person occasioned by theft, fire, act of God, public enemy, injunction, riot, strike, insurrection, war, national emergencies, court order, requisition, or order of governmental body or authority or by any other Force Majeure Matter, nor shall Landlord be liable for any damage or inconvenience which may arise through repair or alteration of any part of the Building or Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p279">28. Events of Default/Remedies.</p>
          <p id="s1p280">(a) The following events shall be deemed to be events of default by Tenant under this Lease (each, an “Event of Default”; collectively, “Events of Default”):</p>
          <p id="s1p281">(i) Tenant fails to pay any installment of Base Rental or Additional Rent when due and such failure continues for more than three (3) days after Tenant is given written notice of such failure (provided, however, Tenant shall not be entitled to such notice and cure period more than once in any calendar year during the Lease Term);</p>
          <p id="s1p282">(ii) Tenant fails to comply with any provision of this Lease (other than clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) in this Paragraph 28(a)), all of which terms, provisions and covenants shall be deemed material and such failure continues for more than fifteen (15) days after Tenant is given written notice of such failure (provided such 15-day notice and cure period for non-monetary defaults shall be decreased or dispensed with, as reasonably required, in cases of emergency or in circumstances where such failure will result in a default by Landlord under other leases of space in the Building);</p>
          <p id="s1p283">19</p>
          <p id="s1p284">(iii) the leasehold hereunder demised is taken on execution or other process of law in any action against Tenant;</p>

          <p id="s1p286">(v) Tenant becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they become due, or Tenant notifies Landlord that it anticipates either condition;</p>
          <p id="s1p287">(vi) Tenant takes any action to or notifies Landlord that Tenant intends to file a petition under any section or chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended from time to time, or under any similar law or statute of the United States or any State thereof; or a petition shall be filed against Tenant under any such statute or Tenant or any creditor of Tenant’s notifies Landlord that it knows such a petition will be filed or Tenant notifies Landlord that it expects such a petition to be filed; or</p>
          <p id="s1p288">(vii) a receiver or trustee is appointed for Tenant’s leasehold interest in the Premises or for all or a substantial part of the assets of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p289">Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions in this Paragraph 28(a), Tenant shall not be entitled to any notice and cure period in connection with Tenant’s obligation to vacate the Premises at the end of the Lease Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p290">(b) Upon the occurrence under this Lease of any Event of Default by Tenant, whether enumerated in Paragraph 28(a) herein or not, Landlord shall have the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies:</p>
          <p id="s1p291">(i) terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord;</p>
          <p id="s1p292">(ii) terminate Tenant’s right to occupy the Premises and re-enter and take possession of the Premises (without terminating this Lease) and relet or attempt to relet the Premises for the account of Tenant and Landlord shall not be deemed to have thereby accepted a surrender of the Premises, and Tenant shall remain liable for all Base Rental, Additional Rent or other sums due under this Lease and for all damages suffered by Landlord because of Tenant’s breach of any provision of this Lease;</p>
          <p id="s1p293">(iii) enter upon the Premises and do whatever Tenant is obligated to do under the terms of this Lease, and Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord on demand for any expense which Landlord may incur in effecting compliance with Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, and Tenant further agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for any damages resulting to Tenant from such action;</p>
          <p id="s1p294">(iv) accelerate and declare the entire remaining unpaid Base Rental and Additional Rent for the balance of the Lease Term to be immediately due and payable forthwith, and may, at once, take legal action to recover and collect the same; and</p>
          <p id="s1p295">20</p>
          <p id="s1p296">(v) exercise all other remedies and seek all damages available to Landlord at law or in equity, including, without limitation, injunctive relief of all varieties.</p>
          <p id="s1p297">In the event Landlord elects to re-enter or take possession of the Premises after an Event of Default by Tenant, Tenant hereby waives notice of such re-entry or repossession and of Landlord’s intent to re-enter or take possession. Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying said Premises or any part thereof. In addition, the provisions of Paragraph 31 herein shall apply with respect to the period from and after the giving of notice of such termination to Tenant. All of Landlord’s remedies under this Lease shall be cumulative and not exclusive. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more of the remedies herein provided upon an Event of Default shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such default or an election of remedies.</p>

          <p id="s1p299">(d) This Paragraph 28 shall be enforceable to the maximum extent not prohibited by applicable law, and the unenforceability of any portion thereof shall not thereby render unenforceable any other portion. To the extent any provision of applicable law requires some action by Landlord to evidence or effect the termination of this Lease or to evidence the termination of Tenant’s right of occupancy, Tenant and Landlord hereby agree that notice, in writing only and delivered in accordance with Paragraph 37 herein, shall be sufficient to evidence and effect the termination therein provided for.</p>

Landlord shall in no event be responsible for the value, preservation or safekeeping thereof. In the event Tenant does not reclaim any such personal property and pay all costs for any storage and moving thereof within thirty (30) days after the expiration or termination of this Lease, the termination of Tenant’s right to occupy the Premises or the abandonment, desertion or vacating of the Premises by Tenant, Landlord may dispose of such personal property in any way that it deems proper. If Landlord shall sell any such personal property, it shall be entitled to retain from the proceeds the amount of any Rent or other expenses due Landlord, together with the cost of storage and moving and the expense of the sale.

          <p id="s1p302">30. Peaceful Enjoyment.</p>
          <p id="s1p303">Tenant shall, and may peacefully have, hold, and enjoy the Premises against Landlord and all persons claiming by and through or under Landlord for the Lease Term, subject to the other terms hereof, provided Tenant pays the rent and other sums herein recited to be paid by Tenant and performs all of</p>
          <p id="s1p304">21</p>
          <p id="s1p305">Tenant’s covenants and agreements herein contained.

          <p id="s1p306">31. Holding Over.</p>
          <p id="s1p307">If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises or any part thereof after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, whether with or without Landlord’s acquiescence, Tenant shall be deemed a tenant at will. In the event of any such holding over by Tenant after the expiration or other termination of this Lease or in the event Tenant continues to occupy the Premises after the termination of Tenant’s right of possession pursuant to Paragraph 28(b) herein, Tenant shall, throughout the entire holdover period, pay Base Rental, for the first three months of such holdover period, equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the applicable Base Rental in effect immediately before the holdover period began, and for each month thereafter, equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the applicable Base Rental in effect immediately before the holdover period, and such payments shall be made together with all applicable Additional Rent which would have been applicable had the Lease Term continued through the period of such holding over by Tenant. Tenant shall also remain liable for any and all damages, direct and consequential, suffered by Landlord as a result of any holdover without Landlord’s written consent. No holding over by Tenant after the expiration of the Lease Term shall be construed to extend the Lease Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p308">32. Subordination to Mortgage.</p>
          <p id="s1p309">Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien presently existing or hereafter arising upon the Premises, the Building and/or the Land, and to any renewals, modifications, refinancings and extensions thereof, but Landlord agrees that it shall obtain a non-disturbance and attornment agreement from the holders of such liens in form reasonably acceptable to Tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of Landlord to obtain such agreements from the holders of such liens, after the exercise by Landlord of diligent and good faith efforts, shall not be deemed a default by Landlord under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p310">33. Estoppel Certificate.</p>
          <p id="s1p311">Tenant agrees that it will, from time to time upon request by Landlord and within ten (10) days of such request, (a) cooperate and execute and deliver to such persons as Landlord shall request an estoppel certificate certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full force and effect as so modified), stating the dates to which rent and other charges payable under this Lease have been paid, stating that, to the best knowledge of Tenant, Landlord is not in default hereunder (or if Tenant alleges a default, stating the nature of such alleged default) and further stating such other matters as Landlord shall reasonably require; and (b) deliver to</p>

If this Lease is guaranteed by a guarantor, then upon Landlord’s request, Tenant shall cause such guarantor to deliver to Landlord within ten (10) days thereafter, audited financial statements of the guarantor otherwise conforming to the preceding sentence. In the event that Tenant should fail to execute any such estoppel certificate promptly as requested, Tenant hereby irrevocably constitutes Landlord as its attorney-in-fact to execute such estoppel certificate in Tenant’s name, place and stead, it being agreed that such power is one coupled with an interest.</p>
          <p id="s1p314">34. Attorneys’ Fees.</p>
          <p id="s1p315">In the event either party defaults in the performance of any of the terms of this Lease and the other party employs attorney(s) in connection therewith, the defaulting party agrees to pay the prevailing party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation, whether at the trial level, on appeal or in any bankruptcy or administrative proceedings.</p>
          <p id="s1p316">35. No Implied Waiver.</p>
          <p id="s1p317">The failure of either party to insist at any time upon the strict performance of any covenant or agreement herein or to exercise any option, right, power or remedy contained in this Lease shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment thereof for the future. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the monthly installment of rent due under this Lease shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest rent due hereunder, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover the balance of such rent or to pursue any other remedy in this Lease provided.</p>
          <p id="s1p318">36. Personal Liability.</p>
          <p id="s1p319">Any provisions of this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, Tenant hereby agrees that no personal, partnership or corporate liability of any kind or character (including, without limitation, the payment of any judgment) whatsoever now attaches or at any time hereafter under any condition shall attach to Landlord or any of Landlord’s agents, stockholders or partners or any mortgagee for payment of any amounts payable under this Lease or for the performance of any obligation under this Lease. The exclusive remedies of Tenant for the failure of Landlord to perform any of its obligations under this Lease shall be to proceed against the interest of Landlord in and to the Building. The provision contained in the foregoing sentence is not intended to, and shall not, limit any right that Tenant might otherwise have to obtain injunctive relief against Landlord or Landlord’s successors in interest or any suit or action in connection with enforcement or collection of amounts which may become owing or payable under or on account of insurance maintained by Landlord. In no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant, or any interest of Landlord in the Building be subject to execution by Tenant, for any indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages. In no instance whatsoever shall any present, past or future partner, officer, member, manager, director or employee of Tenant have any individual liability to Landlord for the satisfaction of any obligations or liabilities of Tenant under this Lease, all such individual liability, if any, being expressly, unconditionally and irrevocably waived and released by Tenant.</p>

          <p id="s1p483">2.1. Substantial Completion – Tenant’s Work. “Substantial Completion” of the Tenant Improvements shall be conclusively deemed to have occurred upon the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or its equivalent by the proper governmental entity. Notwithstanding the above, the Tenant’s Work shall be considered Substantially Complete even though even though there remain to be completed in the Premises punch list items, including but not limited to details of construction, decoration or mechanical adjustment, and/or (b) there is a delay in the Substantial Completion of the Tenant Improvements Work due to a “Tenant Delay” as defined below.</p>
          <p id="s1p484">2.2. Tenant Delay. The following items shall be referred to individually as a “Tenant Delay”, in addition to any other items described as a “Tenant Delay” in this Work Agreement:</p>

          <p id="s1p490">Tenant Improvements — Performed by Contractor Hired by Landlord</p>
          <p id="s1p491">Landlord and Tenant hereby agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p492">1. In order to “Substantially Complete” the Leased Premises by April 25, 2005, Landlord and Tenant have agreed to direct their respective schedules of submittals, reviews, responses and bid awards in accordance with the periods of time as reflected by the schedule of dates in the Design and Construction Timeline (“Timeline”) attached to and accompanying this Exhibit 5.1 and Schedule “2”. Tenant agrees to employ CSJM Architects for the purpose of preparing a space plan which delineates Tenant’s functional requirements in the Premises Tenant’s architect will, within fifteen (15) working days, submit to Landlord for Landlord’s approval, a space plan depicting Tenant’s requirements (“Space Plans”). Landlord agrees to pay CSJM within thirty (30) days of Space Plan completion and billing receipt, up to an amount equal to $.12 per rentable square foot of the Premises. The Space Plans will be prepared in strict accordance with all applicable building codes and ordinances, rules and regulations of applicable governmental authorities and will be subject to Landlord’s approval, in Landlord’s sole discretion. Tenant and Landlord shall have three (3) business days to mutually comment upon, respond to and approve the Space Plans.</p>
          <p id="s1p493">2. Upon receipt and approval of the space plans, Landlord will submit the same to no less than three (3) general contractors (two (2) of which shall be Solutions, Inc. and Ed Taylor Construction) who have significant experience constructing Class A office interior space for detailed line item competitive bids using unit pricing. Landlord will deliver a copy of the bid comparison and preliminary pricing schedule to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p494">3. Tenant’s architect shall prepare detailed Construction Drawings and MEP’s and finish plans based upon the Space Plans, at Tenant’s expense, but subject to reimbursement from the Tenant Improvement Allowance, and thereafter submit the same to Landlord for Landlord’s approval (“Detailed Plans”), not later than January 31, 2005. The Detailed Plans will be prepared in strict accordance with all applicable building codes and ordinances, rules and regulations of applicable governmental authorities and will be subject to Landlord’s approval, in Landlord’s sole discretion. If Tenant fails to cause the Detailed Plans to be prepared and submitted to Landlord in a timely fashion, then Tenant agrees that any such delay in approval and delivery of Detailed Plans to Landlord will be a “Tenant Delay.” Time is of the essence of Tenant’s delivery of the Detailed Plans to Landlord. If, after Landlord’s approval of Detailed Plans, Tenant makes changes in the mechanical and electrical plans and specifications to be provided by Landlord, Tenant will pay to Landlord the cost of having such changes made and any delay to the Timeline shall be a Tenant Delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p495">4. Upon receipt and approval of the Detailed Plans, Landlord agrees to prepare and deliver to Tenant a spreadsheet report detailing the bids for the cost of constructing Tenant’s Work according to Detailed Plans, based upon not less than three (3) competitive bids submitted by three (3) Florida A licensed general contractors having significant experience constructing Class A interior office space (two (2) of which shall be Solutions, Inc. and Ed Taylor Construction), all based solely upon the Detailed Plans. Landlord, Tenant and ERES will work diligently and in good faith to jointly review the bids and mutually agree upon the award of the construction contract, and then jointly award the construction contract to the contractor with a mutually acceptable bid that meets the Timeline, all not later than three (3) business days following delivery of the bid comparison and pricing schedule to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p496">5. After jointly awarding the construction contract to the contractor as provided in Section 4, above, Landlord will construct the Tenant’s Work in and upon the Premises in accordance with the same. All installations in excess of such scope of work will be for the Tenant’s account and Tenant will pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, any sums in excess of such work promptly. Tenant agrees to pay, as Additional Rent, all amounts due to Landlord in connection with completion of the Tenant Improvements work as provided in Section 9 (b) of the Lease. Any changes in the Tenant Improvements work from the scope, materials or any other features contemplated by the approved Tenant’s Plans will be documented by a change order on a form required by Landlord, and paid for in advance in full by Tenant. Time is of the essence in delivery of Tenant’s Plans by Tenant to Landlord as provided herein. If, after construction commences, Tenant makes any changes to Tenant’s Plans which causes delay in the date that the Substantial Completion of the Tenant Improvements would otherwise have occurred, Tenant agrees that any such delay will be a “Tenant Delay.”</p>
          <p id="s1p497">6. Landlord will provide a Tenant Improvements Allowance equal to $21.00 per rentable square foot for the entire Premises (being the total sum of $1,555,365.00). Any unused Tenant Improvements Allowance may be applied to Tenant’s moving expenses, to purchase a generator, cubes, Tenant FF&amp;E to be installed in the Premises, and/or against future installments of Base Rental. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will less than $1,259,105.00 of the total Tenant Improvements Allowance be expended for hard cost improvements to the Premises, and in no event will more than more than $296,260.00 be used to offset rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p498">7. Landlord will permit Tenant and its agents to enter the Premises prior to April 25, 2005 or the date targeted for Substantial Completion in order for Tenant to perform, through its own contractors, approved in advance by Landlord, such other work and decorations as Tenant may desire, at the same time that Landlord’s contractors are working in the Premises. If granted, Landlord’s consent will be conditioned upon there being no interference with Landlord’s contractors by Tenant’s contractors in execution of their respective tasks. Tenant’s access pursuant to this subsection will be at all times subject to the direction, control and restrictions of Landlord. Tenant releases Landlord and agrees to defend, indemnify and save harmless Landlord from against any injury, loss or damage which may occur to any of Tenant’s decorations or installations so made prior to the Commencement Date of the Term. If any contractor or other person employed by Tenant or any contractor or subcontractor of Tenant causes a delay in completing any work being performed by Landlord, then such delay will constitute a “Tenant Delay.”</p>
          <p id="s1p499">5. Tenant agrees to pay ERES a construction management fee equal to four percent (4%) of all construction costs and fees.</p>

However, the prohibition in the immediately preceding sentence shall not limit or restrict any tenant’s right to maintain within the premises occupied by such tenant any signs, directories, posters, advertisements, or notices so long as such items are not visible from the exterior of the premises occupied by such tenant or from the Common Areas of the Building. Building standard suite identification signs will be prepared by Landlord at each tenant’s expense.

          <p id="s1p597">4.No tenant shall do, or permit anything to be done, in or about the Building, or bring or keep anything therein or on property kept therein, that will in any way increase the rate of fire or other insurance on the Building (unless Tenant pays for any and all such increased costs and premiums), or otherwise increase the possibility of fire or other casualty.</p>
          <p id="s1p598">5.Landlord shall have the power to prescribe the weight and position of heavy equipment or objects which may overstress any portion of the floor.

          <p id="s1p608">15.Landlord has the right to evacuate the Building when Landlord, using reasonable prudent judgment and in good faith, deems it necessary in the event of a possible emergency or catastrophe, or as may be directed by any governmental authority having jurisdiction thereover. Notwithstanding the forgoing, in the event the Tenant does not evacuate the building Tenant hereby assumes all risk and liability and hereby releases and waives all claims against Landlord, its officers, directors, agents,</p>
          <p id="s1p609">employees and invitees (collectively the “Landlord Parties”) from injury, death, loss or damage to person, property or business sustained in or about the Premises or the Building (including Tenant’s personal property and equipment) that arises directly from Tenant’s failure to evacuate the Building in a timely fashion.

Replacement keys or access cards or codes (i.e., replacements for keys or access cards or codes previously issued by Landlord) shall be obtained only from Landlord, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord (as Additional Rent, within thirty (30) days after Tenant receives an invoice therefor) the actual costs incurred by Landlord in obtaining and issuing replacement keys or access cards or codes for keys or access cards or codes previously issued.</p>
          <p id="s1p612">18.Tenants will not locate furnishings or cabinets adjacent to mechanical or electrical access panels or over air conditioning outlets so as to prevent operating personnel from servicing such units as routine or emergency access may require.

          <p id="s1p617">EXHIBIT F</p>
          <p id="s1p618">Special Stipulations and Rights</p>
          <p id="s1p619">1. So long as this Lease is in full force and effect, and Tenant is not in default beyond any applicable notice and cure period in the performance of any of the covenants or terms and conditions of this Lease at the time of notification to Landlord or at the time of commencement of either Extension Period, as that term is hereinafter defined. Tenant shall have the option (the “Extension Option”) to extend the Term for the entire Premises for two (2) additional periods of five (5) years each (each being an “Extension Period”), at the Prevailing Market Rate (as hereinafter defined), subject to the following terms and conditions: Tenant shall provide Landlord with twelve (12) months written notice of its desire to extend this Lease for each applicable Extension Period. Extension Options.“Prevailing Market Rate” shall mean the then prevailing market rate for rent for new leases comparable to this Lease for space comparable to the Premises in comparable buildings within a five mile radius of the Building, similar in age, quality and amenities, on a net effective basis by taking into account such factors offered to third party tenants for comparable space as (x) the base services year for pass-through expenses, and (y) rent concessions, tenant improvement or moving allowances or lease commissions saved or incurred. Within fifteen (15) days after Tenant’s exercise of the applicable Extension Option, Landlord shall advise Tenant in writing of its determination of the Prevailing Market Rate, on a rentable square foot basis, and the Basic Costs Expense Stop for the payment of Operating Expenses by Tenant as of the beginning of the Extension Period and any escalations of said Prevailing Market Rate during the Extension Period. Within five (5) days of receipt of Landlord’s notice, Tenant shall advise Landlord, in writing, whether or not Tenant accepts or rejects the Prevailing Market Rate proposed by Landlord. If Tenant accepts such rate and Basic Costs Expense Stop in writing, then the Base Rent rate and Basic Costs Expense Stop during the applicable Extension Period shall be said rate with escalations as provided in the determination, if any, and Basic Costs Expense Stop. If Tenant rejects in writing the Prevailing Market Rate and Basic Costs Expense Stop proposed by Landlord, Landlord and Tenant shall negotiate in good faith for a period of fifteen (15) days to reach a mutual agreement on the Prevailing Market Rate. If the parties are unable to come to an agreement within such period, Tenant shall have the option, exercisable by written notice delivered to Landlord within five (5) days after the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period, to elect to arbitrate such rate. Tenant shall have the option to specify in such notice its selection of an MAI appraiser, who shall act on Tenant’s behalf in determining the Prevailing Market Rate and Basic Costs Expense Stop or elect to allow the then-current Term of this Lease to expire. Within fifteen (15) days after Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s selection of an MAI appraiser, Landlord, by written notice to Tenant shall designate an MAI appraiser, who shall act on Landlord’s behalf in the determination of the Prevailing Market Rate and Basic Costs Expense Stop. Within fifteen (15) days of the selection of Landlord’s appraiser, the two appraisers shall select a third appraiser meeting the qualifications stated below. Each of the parties shall bear one-half (1/2) of the third appraiser’s fee. If the three (3) appraisers are unable to agree upon the Prevailing Market Rate and Basic Costs Expense Stop within the fifteen (15) days following the appointment of the third appraiser, then each appraiser shall separately determine the Prevailing Market Rate, they shall average the two (2) closest figures, and within three (3) days after the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period, the appointed third appraiser shall notify Landlord and Tenant of such averaged determination of the Prevailing Market Rate, which averaged determination shall be binding upon both Landlord and Tenant. In the event that one of the three appraisal Prevailing Market Rates is equidistant between the highest and the lowest, then notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, there shall be no averaging, and the equidistant Prevailing Market Rate shall be the final arbitrated rate. In the event that the appraisal process has not been completed prior to the commencement of the applicable Extension Period, then upon commencement of the applicable Extension Period, and until the process is completed (the “Interim Period”), Tenant shall pay Landlord</p>
          <p id="s1p620">monthly Base Rental equal to the monthly Base Rental for the immediately preceding Lease year, until the increase in the Base Rental is determined by such process as provided herein; provided, however, that such payments made during the Interim Period shall be subject to adjustment based upon the results of such process. If, as a result of such appraisal process, it is determined that Tenant has underpaid Base Rental during the Interim Period, then such underpaid Base Rental shall be due from Tenant to Landlord within ten (10) days after expiration of the Interim Period. All appraisers selected in accordance with this subparagraph must be licensed in the state of Florida as MAI appraisers and shall have at least ten (10) years prior experience in commercial office leasing in the metropolitan Tampa Bay area. If either Landlord or Tenant fails or refuses to select an appraiser, the other appraiser shall alone determine the Prevailing Market Rate. Landlord and Tenant agree that they shall be bound by the determination of Prevailing Market Rate pursuant to this subparagraph for the then applicable Extension Period. Landlord shall bear the fee and expenses of its appraiser and Tenant shall bear the fee and expenses of its appraiser.</p>
          <p id="s1p621">2.Suite 100 Expansion Option. Landlord grants to Tenant the one-time right (the “Suite 100 Expansion Right”) to lease the Suite 100 Space, as hereinafter defined, at any time during the Lease Term, on and subject to the following terms and conditions. The Suite 100 Expansion Right is: 1) effective only if the tenant under the “Byrd Lease” (as defined hereinafter) vacates; 2) if Tenant is not in default under this Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period; and 3) Tenant’s financial condition, as revealed by its most recent financial statements, must demonstrate that Tenant’s net worth is at least equal to its net worth at the time this Lease was executed and that other financial criteria are at least equal to its current financial condition.</p>
          <p id="s1p622">a. As used herein, the term “Suite 100 Space” shall mean that certain office space consisting of approximately 5,567 rentable square feet in the Building, and currently subject to that certain lease between Landlord and The Byrd Corporation (the “Byrd Lease”). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Tenant exercises the Suite 100 Expansion Right, it shall be deemed that the Premises, as expanded by the Suite 100 Space, shall consist of a total area of 79,660 rentable square feet.</p>
          <p id="s1p623">b. At such time that the Suite 100 Space becomes, or about to become vacant because the Byrd Lease has or will expire without a renewal or extension thereof whether pursuant to an express renewal or extension option or not and Landlord desires to lease the Suite 100 Space, Landlord agrees that it will promptly so notify Tenant in writing of the rental rate offered to a third party (“Third Party Offer”) or if no Third Party Offer is outstanding, then Landlord will offer the then current rental rate under the terms of this Lease. Tenant shall have a period of ten (10) business days after the date of the notice to Tenant within which to exercise the Suite 100 Expansion Option (the “Acceptance Period”) by delivery to Landlord to written notice of its exercise on or before the last day of the Acceptance Period. If Tenant fails to duly and timely exercise the Suite 100 Expansion Option, or elects not to exercise the Suite 100 Expansion Option, the same shall lapse, and be of no further force and effect, and Landlord shall be free to lease the Suite 100 Space.</p>
          <p id="s1p624">c. Within ten (10) business days after the effective date of Tenant’s exercise of the Suite 100 Expansion Option, Landlord and Tenant shall enter into an amendment to this Lease adding the Suite 100 Space to the Premises, which amendment shall subject the Suite 100 to the terms and provisions of this Lease, except that the Base Rent and Basic Costs Expense Stop relating to the Suite 100 Space shall be the lesser of either the then current Basic Rent and Basic Expanse Stop rate set forth in this Lease or the rates as set forth in the Third Party Offer, and shall contain such other terms or modifications as may be appropriate, all commencing and accruing effective as of the date that the Suite 100 Space is vacated by the tenant under the Byrd Lease. In addition to the foregoing, it shall be stipulated and stated in the lease amendment that: (i) the Premises, as expanded by the Suite 100 Space, shall consist of a total area of</p>
          <p id="s1p625">79,660 rentable square feet; (ii) “Tenant’s Proportionate Share” shall be 100%; and (iii) there shall be no “Common Area” other than the Building Exterior Common Area and the roof top and such other means of ingress and egress and mechanical or electrical rooms or areas within the Building as may be necessary to permit Landlord to perform its obligations under this Lease or under agreements with third parties for use or space on the roof, or by law. The term with respect to the Suite 100 Space shall be coterminous with this Lease Term. There shall be no tenant allowance. Tenant and Landlord shall use their best efforts to respectively execute and deliver the lease amendment within fifteen days following the delivery of the same to Tenant; provided, however, the terms and provisions of the lease amendment as set forth herein shall be self-effectuating, and failure of the parties to execute such lease amendment shall not negate or nullify the terms and conditions and obligations between the parties hereto as it relates to the Suite 100 Space as provided in this paragraph.</p>
          <p id="s1p626">d. The right granted to Tenant under this paragraph is personal to Tenant, and in the event of any assignment of this Lease or sublease of the Premises by Tenant to any party, this right shall thenceforth be void and of no further force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p627">3. New Construction Expansion Right.</p>
          <p id="s1p628">a. Landlord grants to Tenant the one-time right (the “New Construction Expansion Right”) to lease the “New Construction Space”, as hereinafter defined in the Building, on and subject to the following terms and conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p629">b. The New Construction Expansion Right is not effective or exercisable by Tenant during the existence of a default by Tenant under this Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period (which cure period may be extended by Landlord in the event that Tenant is not reasonably able to cure the default or breach within such cure period and Tenant is diligently pursuing remedial efforts to completion within a reasonable time thereafter, not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days). In addition, Tenant’s financial condition, as demonstrated by its then most recent financial statements, must show the Tenant’s net worth is at least equal to its net worth at the time this Lease was executed and that other financial criteria are at least equal to its current financial condition. In addition, the New Construction Expansion Right shall terminate and be null and void upon the sale or transfer of the Building by 100 Carillon, LLC to third party, or upon the sale or transfer of all of the membership interest in 100 Carillon, LLC by Echelon Development LLC to a third party. Furthermore, the New Construction Expansion Right is not effective or exercisable by Tenant at any time that there is less than five years preceding the expiration of the Lease Term (as may be extended by the exercise of any of the Extension Periods). The term with respect to the New Building Space shall be coterminous with this Lease Term; provided, however, if Tenant exercises this New Construction Expansion Right at any time during the last ten (10) years of the Term or during any Extension Period, then Tenant agrees that the Lease Term for the entire Premises, including the New Construction Space, shall be extended so that there is a minimum of ten (10) years left remaining in the Term, including the exercise of any renewal options.</p>
          <p id="s1p630">c. Tenant shall exercise its New Construction Expansion Right by timely delivering written notice to Landlord (“New Expansion Notice”).</p>
          <p id="s1p631">d. Upon delivery of the New Expansion Notice, Landlord and Tenant each agree that they shall use good faith in reviewing and negotiating plans, drawing, projected construction timeframes, projected costs, and other material terms and conditions for the design, construction and leasing of an additional approximate 30,000 rentable square feet of office space in the Building and</p>
          <p id="s1p632">additional parking to provide at least 4 parking spaces per 1,000 rentable square feet of such additional space (“New Construction Space”). In addition, Tenant shall provide Landlord with security or a bond in form and amount satisfactory to Landlord in Landlord’s sole discretion, to assure Tenant’s performance of its agreement to lease the New Construction Space following the completion of its construction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all obligations hereunder shall be subject to and conditioned upon Landlord obtaining all necessary development rights, platting, permits, governmental and Carillon Property Owners Association approvals, and financing (including, without limitation, the approval or consent of the holder of any lien on the Land to construction financing of the New Construction Space, all at terms acceptable to Landlord, in Landlord’s sole discretion. Furthermore, the rental rate and parking charges for such New Construction Space shall be based upon the then current market return on the cost of development of such New Construction Space, and Tenant acknowledges any New Construction Space will require structured parking. The proposed lease or lease amendment must also contain such other mutually acceptable terms and conditions, without regard to the existing terms and conditions set forth in this Lease; provided however, Landlord and Tenant agree that Tenant’s allowance for leasehold improvements shall $21.00 per rentable square foot. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Landlord and Tenant cannot, in good faith, agree upon the rent, charges, security, and other terms and conditions to govern the construction and lease of the New Construction Space within four months following Tenant’s New Expansion Notice, then either party may elect to terminate further negotiations, whereupon all rights and liabilities arising under this Stipulation No. 3 of this Exhibit F shall cease.</p>
          <p id="s1p633">e. The right granted to Tenant under this paragraph is personal to Tenant, and in the event of any assignment of this Lease or sublease of the Premises by Tenant to any party, this New Construction Expansion Right shall thenceforth be void and of no further force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p634">4. New Carillon Building Expansion Right.</p>
          <p id="s1p635">In the event that, prior to the two years preceding the expiration of the Lease Term (as may be extended by the exercise of any of the Extension Periods) Landlord elects to construct and own a speculative office-only building in Carillon Park that does not have pre-existing lease commitments for occupancy and sale to any third party or is not intended for development as an office or residential condominium (“New Building”), Landlord shall thereafter grant to Tenant the one-time right (the “New Carillon Building Expansion Right”) to lease office space in the New Building (“New Building Space”) consisting of not less than 50,000 rentable square feet, on and subject to the following terms and conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p636">a. The New Carillon Building Expansion Right is not effective or exercisable by Tenant during the existence of a default by Tenant under this Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period (which cure period may be extended by Landlord in the event that Tenant is not reasonably able to cure the default or breach within such cure period and Tenant is diligently pursuing remedial efforts to completion within a reasonable time thereafter, not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days). In addition, Tenant’s financial condition, as revealed by its most recent financial statements, must demonstrate that Tenant’s net worth is at least equal to its net worth at the time this Lease was executed and that other financial criteria are at least equal to its current financial condition. In addition, the New Carillon Building Expansion Right shall terminate and be null and void upon the sale or transfer of the Building by 100 Carillon, LLC to third party, or upon the sale or transfer of all of the membership interest in 100 Carillon, LLC by Echelon Development LLC to a third party. Furthermore, the New Carillon Building Expansion Right is not effective or exercisable by Tenant at any time that there is less than five years preceding the expiration of the Lease Term (as may be extended by the exercise of any of the Extension Periods). The New Carillon Building Expansion Right is effective only upon the receipt by Landlord of all development rights, platting, permits, governmental and Carillon Property Owners Association approvals, and financing, all at terms acceptable to Landlord, in Landlord’s sole discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p637">b. In the event that Landlord elects to cause the New Building to be constructed prior to two years preceding the expiration of the Lease Term (as may be extended by the exercise of any of the Extension Periods), Landlord shall offer the New Building Space to Tenant in writing (“First Offer Leasing Notice”), which notice shall contain a description of the New Offer Building Space and the projected date of completion of the New Building (excluding any tenant improvements) and the desired terms and conditions of rent and other charges. Tenant shall exercise its New Carillon Building Expansion Right by timely delivering written notice to Landlord (“New Building Notice”) not later than thirty days following the receipt of the First Offer Leasing Notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p638">c. Upon delivery of the New Building Notice, Landlord and Tenant each agree that they shall use good faith efforts to negotiate the rent, charges, security, and other mutually acceptable terms and conditions of a lease for the New Building Space having a term of not less than ten (10) years, all without regard to the existing terms and conditions set forth in this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Landlord and Tenant cannot, in good faith, agree upon the rent, charges, security, and other terms and conditions to govern the lease of the New Building Space within four months following Tenant’s New Building Notice, then either party may elect to terminate further negotiations, whereupon all rights and liabilities arising under this Stipulation No. 4 of this Exhibit F shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Landlord and Tenant execute and deliver a mutually acceptable lease for New Building Space consisting of not less than 110,000 rentable square feet and containing a lease term of not less than 13 years, then Landlord and Tenant will agree to terminate any and all then remaining obligations arising under the terms of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p639">d. The right granted to Tenant under this paragraph is personal to Tenant, and in the event of any assignment of this Lease or sublease of the Premises by Tenant to any party, this New Carillon Building Expansion Right shall thenceforth be void and of no further force and effect.</p>
