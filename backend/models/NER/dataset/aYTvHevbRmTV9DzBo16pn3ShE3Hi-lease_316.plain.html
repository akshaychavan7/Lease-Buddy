          <p id="s1p1">EXHIBIT 10.10 October 3, 1997 Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. 9955 S. E. Washington, Suite 201 Portland, OR 97216 Attention: Ms. Keren Brown Wilson, Chief Executive Officer RE: AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AND LEASE ASSISTED LIVING RESIDENCES Dear Ms. Wilson: LTC Properties, Inc. (&quot;LTC&quot;) is pleased to advise you that LTC agrees, either itself or through its subsidiary or affiliate, and subject to the parameters outlined in this letter, to enter into sale/leaseback transactions with Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. (&quot;ALC&quot;) with respect to certain properties the precise identity of which shall be determined as set forth herein (each individually a &quot;Property&quot; and collectively, the &quot;Properties&quot;), and each of which Properties shall be improved with an assisted living facility (each a &quot;Facility&quot; and collectively, the &quot;Facilities&quot;). The total cumulative purchase price to be paid by LTC to ALC for the Properties and the Facilities shall be not less than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) (the &quot;Total Purchase Price&quot;). As we have previously discussed, ALC will sell and assign all of its right, title and interest in and to all real and personal property and fixtures comprising the Properties to LTC, and LTC or its designee will purchase the Properties from ALC and will lease the Properties back to ALC, all upon the following terms and conditions: 1. PURCHASE PRICE. LTC shall pay ALC the Total Purchase Price in -------------- connection with the purchase of all of the Properties. Once LTC has purchased such a number of the Properties that LTC has spent an amount equal to the Total Purchase Price (or an amount such that LTC cannot purchase another one of the Properties without exceeding the Total Purchase Price), then LTC thereafter shall not be obligated to purchase any more of the Properties. With respect to the purchase of each individual Property, LTC shall pay ALC a purchase price equal to ALC's total hard and soft construction costs (that is, soft costs related directly to acquisition of the Properties and construction of the Facilities thereon, but not soft costs in connection with any other properties or facilities developed, constructed, owned and/or operated by ALC) in connection with construction of the Facility on the Property, but in no event exceeding Seventy Thousand Dollars ($70,000.00) (except for any Property located in the State of New Jersey, in which case the figure shall be Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00)) per assisted living unit in the Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. October 3, 1997 Page 2 Facility constructed on the Property (the &quot;Specific Property Purchase Price&quot;). The Specific Property Purchase Price shall be paid in all cash at Closing with respect to each Property. In addition to the Specific Property Purchase Price with respect to a Property, at ALC's option, LTC shall be obligated to pay to ALC, or its designee, for each Facility on a Property, up to One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) of losses incurred by ALC in the stabilization period of the Facility incurred either (i) by ALC, or (ii) by a third party pursuant to a participation or other agreement with ALC (the &quot;Stabilization Period Losses&quot;). LTC shall be obligated to pay to ALC, or its designee, the Stabilization Period Losses at Closing with respect to each Property if the amount of the Stabilization Period Losses is ascertainable at such time. To the extent that the amount of the Stabilization Period Losses is not ascertainable at the time of LTC's purchase of any Property, LTC shall remain obligated to pay to ALC, or its designee, the Stabilization Period Losses at such time as the amount of the Stabilization Period Losses becomes ascertainable; provided, further, that as a pre-condition to LTC's obligation to disburse any such amount to ALC, or its designee, LTC shall cause to be prepared at ALC's expense, and ALC shall execute, an amendment to its lease (a) increasing the initial annual minimum rental amount thereunder by a percentage of the amount of the Stabilization Period Losses, which percentage shall equal the then existing lease rate determined in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof, and (b) to the extent payment of the Stabilization Period Losses is made to ALC's designee, acknowledging the benefit ALC has received in consideration of such rental increase. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE. Notwithstanding the present execution and delivery of -------------- this commitment letter and the intention of the parties that this commitment letter shall be immediately binding upon the parties hereto, no transactions under the terms of this commitment letter shall be commenced until on or after January 1, 1998. 3. DETERMINATION OF PROPERTIES; PROPERTY APPLICATION MATERIALS. The ----------------------------------------------------------- determination of which assisted living properties shall become Properties subject to this commitment letter shall be made by LTC in its sole discretion based upon materials supplied by ALC.

The survey shall also certify that the Property is or is not in a flood hazard area for purposes of the national Flood Insurance Program, and if so, shall specify the flood zone designation assigned to the Property; provided, however, that if ALC's surveyor for any reason cannot or will not provide such flood zone information, ALC shall be entitled to, and shall, provide such information to LTC from another source acceptable to LTC in the reasonable exercise of LTC's discretion. The survey shall be dated on or after substantial completion of the construction of the Facility on each Property. In addition, the record legal description of each Property must appear on the survey of that Property, and any record easements or servitudes and covenants affecting each Property which are capable of being plotted must be plotted thereon; (iv) LTC shall have received a Phase I environmental assessment of each of the Properties in form and content, and performed by an environmental consultant, entirely acceptable to LTC in LTC's reasonable discretion; (v) LTC shall have received UCC lien, tax lien and judgment lien searches dated after the date of substantial completion of the assisted living facility on each Property evidencing that no liens exist as to the personal property located on each Property other than those liens previously approved in writing by LTC; (vi) LTC shall be satisfied with the physical condition of the assisted living facilities located on the Properties based on a physical inspection of each Property by LTC; Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assisted Living Concepts, Inc.

TERM; CROSS-DEFAULTING. Each lease shall have an initial ----------------------- term of twelve (12) years. ALC and LTC contemplate that LTC will acquire the Properties, and lease them back to ALC, its subsidiary or affiliate, at such time as the construction of the assisted living facility on each Property is completed, the certificate of occupancy and operator's license with respect thereto issued and all other pre-conditions to Closing have been met with respect to each Property. As a result, the parties anticipate that the Properties will not all be acquired by LTC at one time, and ALC's obligation to pay Minimum Rent and other charges under each lease will commence concurrently with LTC's acquisition of the Property to which the lease relates. The lease with respect to each Property shall group the Property with three or four other properties owned (or to be owned) by LTC and leased (or to be leased) to ALC, its subsidiary or affiliate, each such group of four (4) or more Properties hereinafter being referred to as a &quot;Package,&quot; and all of the Properties to be included in a Package shall be identified to, and approved by, LTC (on Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. October 3, 1997 Page 6 the basis of the Property Application Materials) by not later than the date of the closing of the first Property in the Package to be acquired by LTC; provided, however, that if ALC has not identified the Properties in each Package to LTC by such time or if such Properties have not yet been approved by LTC pursuant to Paragraph 3, hereof, LTC shall have the right, but not the obligation, then or at any time thereafter, to determine which Properties shall be included within the Package selecting only from Properties approved by LTC in accordance with Paragraph 3, hereof. ALC shall have two consecutive five-year options to extend the term of all of the leases within each Package; that is, ALC shall only have the option - --- to extend the term of any of the leases in a Package so long as ALC exercises its option to extend the term of all of the leases in a Package. In addition, the leases for all of the Properties in each Package shall be co-terminus with all of the other leases in that Package, but will not be co-terminus with the leases in the other Packages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the leases for each of the Properties shall be cross-defaulted with (i) each lease for each of the other Properties (irrespective of which Package the Properties are in), and (ii) every other lease between LTC and ALC (including without limitation any leases between LTC, on the one hand, and Home and Community Care, Inc. and/or Carriage House Assisted Living, Inc., on the other hand, if an when either of said entities (or the assets thereof) is acquired by ALC) with respect to any assisted living facility, except for those five (5) leases relating to those certain five (5) assisted living properties in the State of Washington commonly known as: Chenoweth House, Kennewick, WA; Pioneer House, Walla Walla, WA; Orchard House, Grandview, WA; Lexington House, Vancouver, WA: and Mountain View House, Camas, WA. In addition to the foregoing, if a default is declared and not cured within thirty (30) days on any of ALC's major (that is, $5,000,000 or more) loans or lines of credit, or if such loan or line of credit is accelerated or the lender thereunder takes any action to enforce the same, then LTC shall have the right, but not the obligation, also to declare a default under each of the leases entered into hereunder. 6. MINIMUM RENT. The initial annual Minimum Rent for the first ------------ year of each lease shall be an amount equal to the sum of the Specific Property Purchase Price and the Stabilization Period Losses (to the extent then ascertainable) paid by LTC (or its designee) for each Property multiplied by the average rate on the ten-year Treasury Security for the five (5) business days prior to the third (3/rd/) business day prior to the closing plus three hundred ---- fifty (350) basis points. ALC shall pay an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the annual Minimum Rent applicable to each Property on the first day of each and every month during the term of the leases without demand, abatement (except as specifically set forth in the leases with respect to a partial condemnation of a Property), set-off or notice. Commencing on the first anniversary of the rent commencement date for each lease (the &quot;Anniversary Date&quot;), and continuing thereafter on each subsequent Anniversary Date during the initial term and each option term of each lease, the Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. October 3, 1997 Page 7 Minimum Rent applicable to each lease shall be increased in accordance with the terms and provisions attached hereto as Exhibit &quot;A.&quot; 7. RENT DURING OPTION PERIODS. The initial Minimum Rent for the -------------------------- first of the option terms for each lease shall be the higher of: (i) the previous year's Minimum Rent amount increased in accordance with the terms and provisions attached hereto as Exhibit &quot;A&quot;; or (ii) an amount equal to the initial Minimum Rent payable in the first twelve (12) months of the initial term of the lease adjusted by the cumulative increase in the Consumer Price Index, U.S. Cities Average, All Items (1982-84=100) published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics in accordance with the manner presently calculated (the &quot;CPI&quot;) from the commencement date of the applicable lease to the date on which the new Minimum Rent is being determined. The initial Minimum Rent for the second of the option terms for each lease shall be the higher of: (i) the previous year's Minimum Rent amount increased in accordance with the terms and provisions attached hereto as Exhibit &quot;A&quot;; (ii) an amount equal to the initial Minimum Rent payable in the first twelve (12) months of the first option term of the lease adjusted by the cumulative increase in the CPI from the commencement date of the applicable lease to the date on which the new Minimum Rent is being determined; or (iii) the fair market value rent as determined by an independent appraisal process. 8. TRIPLE NET LEASE. ALC shall be responsible for all costs ---------------- associated with the operation of the Facilities located on the Properties, including, but not limited to, property and other taxes, utilities, insurance premiums and costs to maintain the Facilities in good condition and repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted (collectively &quot;Additional Charges&quot;). Taxes shall include any and all taxes of any kind associated with the real or personal property constituting the assisted living facilities, including, but not limited to, taxes attributable to any period prior to acquisition of the Properties by LTC (or its designee) with the exception of any transfer taxes owing in connection with any subsequent transfer of any of the Properties by LTC to a third party. 9. REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE. ALC shall be responsible for completing ---------------------- any and all work necessary to maintain each Facility located on the Properties as an assisted living residence in good condition and repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted. In addition, at ALC's sole cost and expense, ALC shall complete all applications, give all notices and obtain and maintain all licenses, permits and approvals necessary or desirable to allow ALC to operate the assisted living facilities located on the Properties in accordance with all legal and regulatory requirements. 10. CLOSING. Closing with respect to all Packages of the Properties ------- shall occur not later than December 31, 2000. The Closing with respect to each Property shall be deemed to have occurred upon recordation of the Warranty Deed conveying the Property to LTC, payment of the Specific Property Purchase Price and the Stabilization Period Losses (to the extent then Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. October 3, 1997 Page 8 ascertainable) with respect thereto, and full execution and delivery of the lease between LTC and ALC with respect thereto. 11. INDEMNITY. The lease with respect to each Property shall provide --------- that ALC shall fully indemnify, defend, protect and hold LTC harmless from and against any and all costs, losses, expenses, judgments, claims, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) or damages of any kind or nature whatsoever arising from or relating to the Facilities located on the Properties and the operation thereof, including, but not limited to, all matters relating to (i) the presence of hazardous substances located on the Properties, (ii) compliance with or failure to comply with the provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, (iii) compliance with or failure to comply with the provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988; (iv) compliance with or failure to comply with the provisions of Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, and any and all other matters whatsoever relating to the Properties, the Facilities located thereon and the operation thereof. ALC's indemnification obligations set forth in this Paragraph shall survive the expiration or termination for any reason of this commitment letter. 12. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING. ALC shall not be entitled to sublet any ------------------------- portion of any of the Properties, or assign any one or more of the leases, without the prior written consent of LTC, which consent shall not be given by LTC unless in connection with the subletting and/or assignment, ALC will remain primarily liable for all obligations under the applicable lease or leases. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 12, ALC shall be entitled, at any time without first obtaining the consent of LTC, to (i) assign any one or more of the leases to a wholly-owned subsidiary of ALC so long as ALC, concurrently with such assignment, delivers to LTC a first-loss full guaranty of such subsidiary's obligations under the assigned lease(s) in form and substance acceptable to LTC in LTC's reasonable discretion, and (ii) sublease up to the greater of (A) 2,000 square feet, or (B) ten percent (10%) of the total square footage of the applicable Facility in any one or more of the Facilities located on the Properties to, any person or entity providing any services related or ancillary to the operation of the Facilities, or in connection with the provision of home health services both within and outside the Facilities. 13.

Upon ALC's request, LTC shall instruct its attorneys to prepare closing binders for ALC and its Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. October 3, 1997 Page 9 counsel with respect to each sale/leaseback transaction, and ALC shall be responsible for paying the actual cost of producing and shipping said closing binders. 14. PHYSICAL INSPECTION. As a precondition to LTC's obligations under ------------------- this commitment letter to acquire the Properties, LTC shall have the right to conduct a physical inspection of each assisted living facility on each Property, and LTC must be satisfied with the physical condition of each of the Properties after completion of the construction of the assisted living facilities thereon, in LTC's reasonable discretion. 15.

Accordingly, on the date of each such closing, the amount owing by ALC under the Commitment Fee Note shall be reduced by an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the applicable Specific Property Purchase Price. So long as on or beforeDecember 31, 2000 LTC and ALC have closed sale/leaseback transactions hereunder such that the combined Specific Property Purchase Prices of all such Properties is equal or greater than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00), then the Commitment Fee will be fully refunded to ALC, and LTC shall return the original Commitment Fee Note to ALC marked &quot;canceled.&quot; SINCE IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIX THE ACTUAL DAMAGES WHICH WOULD BE SUFFERED BY LTC IN THE EVENT ALC DEFAULTS UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMITMENT LETTER AND AS A RESULT OF SAID DEFAULT FAILS TO CLOSE THE OVERALL TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS COMMITMENT LETTER BY DECEMBER 31, 2000, AND SO LONG AS LTC IS NOT ALSO IN DEFAULT OF THIS COMMITMENT LETTER AS A RESULT OF WHICH DEFAULT LTC HAS FAILED TO CLOSE ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN, THEN IN SUCH EVENT, LTC SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ENFORCE THE Ms. Keren Brown Wilson Assisted Living Concepts, Inc.
