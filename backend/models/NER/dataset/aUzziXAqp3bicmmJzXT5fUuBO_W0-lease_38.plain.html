          <p id="s1p133">•</p>
          <p id="s1p134">Enforcement: Landlord will make reasonable efforts to enforce the Wachovia Lease (including the rent obligations). If Wachovia defaults under the Wachovia Lease, then Alliance may, at its option, participate in any action Landlord takes in respect of said default. If Landlord does not take any action, then Alliance may, at its option, (1) cause the Landlord to assign its right to proceed against Wachovia, in which case Alliance may then proceed directly against Wachovia provided that Alliance indemnifies Landlord from any loss arising from such action, or (2) require the Landlord to proceed against Wachovia in which case Alliance will reimburse Landlord within 30 days after demand for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Landlord in respect of enforcing the Wachovia Lease (Sup21 §4(f)).</p>
          <p id="s1p135">•</p>
          <p id="s1p136">Amendments, Terminations, Extensions and Consents: Landlord is prohibited from amending the Wachovia Lease or waiving any provision thereof without first obtaining Alliance's consent. Alliance must be reasonable in respect of consenting to any amendment that would not have an economic or adverse impact on Alliance and Alliance's failure to respond to a request for such a consent within 5 business days of receipt is deemed consent. Landlord is prohibited from terminating the term of the Wachovia Lease except in the event of a default thereunder or extending the term of the Wachovia Lease except pursuant to the express provisions thereof without first obtaining Alliance's consent (Sup21 §5(a)). Landlord is prohibited from granting its consent to any matter contemplated by the Wachovia Lease (e.g., subleases and alterations) without first obtaining Alliance's consent. Alliance's rights in respect of Wachovia signage is summarized in more detail below. Alliance is</p>
          <p id="s1p137">5</p>
          <p id="s1p138">required to be reasonable in granting its consent to any such matter if Landlord is obligated to be reasonable under the Wachovia Lease.

          <p id="s1p139">•</p>
          <p id="s1p140">Signage: Wachovia is prohibited from displaying signage on the window, doors or the exterior of the perimeter walls of its demised premises unless Wachovia obtains the prior written reasonable consent of the Landlord and said signage is in conformity with the building standard sign program (Wachovia Lease §46.2(e)). However, Wachovia has the right to install signage on the interior and exterior of the demised premises that conforms with Wachovia's standard national or NYC signage program provided that said signage pertains primarily to general retail banking, safe deposits or electronic banking and not to certain permitted ancillary uses (e.g. brokerage, insurance, investment services). Nevertheless, Wachovia has the right to display temporary signage which describes said ancillary uses in certain designated areas provided that Wachovia is obligated to remove said signage if either Landlord or Alliance reasonably believes that said temporary signage is not in keeping with the quality or character of the building. The size and location of signage on or visible from the exterior of the Ground Floor (part) is subject to the reasonable approval and Landlord and Alliance. Wachovia also has the right to display promotional banners provided the size, color and location of said banners is subject to the reasonable approval of Landlord and Alliance. Landlord's (and, therefore, Alliance's) failure to respond within 15 business days to any request for consent regarding signage is deemed consent (Wachovia Lease §46.3(a)).</p>

          <p id="s1p144">Hold Over by Wachovia: If Wachovia holds over following the termination of the Wachovia Lease term, then Landlord will promptly commence summary dispossess proceedings and will use commercially reasonable efforts to evict Wachovia. Landlord will pay to Alliance any amounts recovered from Wachovia arising from said proceedings after first deducting Landlord's actual out-of-pocket expenses, provided that if the amounts paid over by Landlord exceed the sums paid by Alliance in respect of the Ground Floor (part) for the corresponding period, then Landlord will be permitted to retain 50% of said excess (Sup21 §8).</p>

If Hearst defaults beyond any grace period, then Alliance may, at its option, participate in any action Landlord takes in respect of said default. If Landlord does not take any action, then Alliance may, at its option, (1) cause the Landlord to assign its right to proceed against Hearst, in which case Alliance may then proceed directly against Hearst provided that Alliance indemnifies Landlord from any loss arising from such action, or (2) require the Landlord to proceed against Hearst in which case Alliance will reimburse Landlord within 30 days after demand for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Landlord in respect of said proceeding. Alliance is also obligated to reimburse Landlord for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in respect of enforcing the Hearst Lease after May 1, 2004 (Sup19 §4(c)).</p>

If Landlord and Alliance cannot agree, they will choose a third electrical consultant to perform a limited review (Sup12, §5(c)(ii); Sup12 §4(c)(ii); Sup14 §4(c)(ii); and Sup15 §4(c)(ii)).</p>

Such notice will be given by Alliance on or before, with regard to the 15th and 16th floors, the date Alliance delivers to Landlord its plans for its initial fit-out of the 15th floor (but in no event later than June 30, 2001), and, with regard to the rest of the demised premises, by December 31, 2001 (Sup12 §4(e) and Sup14 §4(e)). Alliance is responsible for any construction costs it would incur in connection with alterations relating to such additional electricity supply, as well as a pro-rata share of Landlord's construction costs (Sup12 §4(e); Sup14 §4(e); and Sup15 §4(f)).</p>

In such case, Alliance may use the existing wiring. The cost of installation of any additional wiring will be borne, if such discontinuance is voluntary, by Landlord, and if such discontinuance is involuntary, by Landlord and Alliance with Alliance's share equal to the total cost of such additional wiring multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is remaining months of the Lease term and the denominator of which is as follows:</p>

The fixed monthly fee for cleaning the office space will increase by $92,734.33 plus an adjustment based on the increase in the labor rate in 2001 over 2000 with the addition of Floors 2, 8, 9, 11-14 to demised premises and will increase by $13,296.17 plus an adjustment based on the increase in the labor rate in 2001 over 2000 with the addition of Floor 10 to demised premises (CAO-5 §3). The fixed monthly fee is inclusive of sales tax and is payable in advance on the first of each month (§3). Payment for any additional cleaning services will be made by Alliance within 20 days of demand. The cost of such additional services must be comparable to services provided in comparable buildings (§1(a)). In addition to the fixed fee, Alliance pays the Cleaning Contractor a percentage of annual increases in cleaning costs (which annual increases are equal to the annual percentage increase in porters' wages over a porter's wage base year) over an amount representing base year cleaning costs.

So long as Alliance and its affiliates occupy at least 200,000 rsf of the building, Landlord is restricted from leasing such space to a competitor of Alliance (Sup9 §14(a)(ii)).

We have been advised by Judd S. Meltzer Co.

Alliance may not accept any such offer of space after 12/31/13 unless Alliance has exercised its ten-year extension option by 12/31/13. This restriction is now nonsensical in light of the extension of term and additional extension rights of Landlord and Alliance under the Fifteenth Supplemental Agreement. We understand that Alliance has had discussions with the Landlord regarding leasing space on the seventeenth floor. We have talked to the Landlord about the foregoing restriction, and the Landlord has agreed to changing these provisions in a supplement to the Lease adding the seventeenth floor space or, if no such transaction is consummated, then pursuant to a separate supplement. In addition, Alliance may not accept any such offer of space if it has exercised all of its extension options and there are less than 5 years remaining to the Lease term (Sup12 §9(a)(iii)(7)).</p>
