          <p id="s1p28">NET LEASE: The Lease will be a net lease in that the Lessee will be responsible for any and all costs and expenses in connection with the Equipment, including sales and use taxes, and any other taxes with the exception of federal and state net income taxes on the net income of the Lessor. The Lessee is also responsible for maintaining and insuring the Equipment and</p>
          <p id="s1p29">for all fees; insurance premiums; cost of installation, operations, maintenance, repair, and rebuilding; and other charges related to the use or possession of the Equipment.</p>
          <p id="s1p30">FEDERAL TAX INDEMNIFICATIONS: The Lessee will indemnify the Lessor for any loss or deduction in federal tax benefits based on the tax assumptions outlined above if such loss or reduction is caused by (i) any breach, inaccuracy or incorrectness of any representation, warranty or covenant made by the Lessee, (ii) the acts or omissions (not including the execution of documents contemplated hereby or any act or omission expressly required or expressly permitted by such documents) of the Lessee, or (iii) any change in federal law with an effective date that precedes the date of acceptance of the Equipment for lease by the Lessee. If an Investment Tax Credit provision is passed, benefit will flow to Lessee at the same lease rate as indicated in this proposal.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">MAINTENANCE: Lessee will maintain the Equipment leased by it so that it remains in good operating condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and in compliance with any and all applicable laws, regulations, and state inspections.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">END OF TERM OPTIONS: At the end of the Basic Term, the Lessee shall have the option of purchasing the Equipment or returning the Equipment to the Lessor in accordance with the terms described below.</p>

          <p id="s1p34">Forty Percent (40%) of the Equipment Cost</p>
          <p id="s1p35">In the event the Lessee chooses to return the Equipment, the Lessor will sell the Equipment. If the Net Proceeds of the sale (after expenses) are greater than the Purchase Price, the excess proceeds will be returned to the Lessee. If the Net Proceeds are less than the Purchase Price, the difference between the proceeds and the Purchase Price will be paid by the Lessee to the Lessor as a final Rental Payment then due.</p>
          <p id="s1p36">DOCUMENTATION: This Proposal is not intended to address all the final legal and documentation matters pertaining to this lease. The lease documentation will represent the final legal agreement. The lease documentation will be furnished by the Lessor.</p>
