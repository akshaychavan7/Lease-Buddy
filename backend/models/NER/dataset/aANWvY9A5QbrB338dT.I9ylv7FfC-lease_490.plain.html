          <p id="s1p8">WILLIS LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION</p>
          <p id="s1p9">Pursuant to Section 151 of the</p>
          <p id="s1p10">General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware</p>
          <p id="s1p11">We, Charles F. Willis, IV, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rae A. Capps, Esq., Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Willis Lease Finance Corporation, a company organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “Company”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 thereof, DO HEREBY CERTIFY:</p>
          <p id="s1p12">That pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), and in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the “GCL”), the Board of Directors, on September 14, 1999, adopted the following resolution creating a series of its Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share:</p>
          <p id="s1p13">RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors hereby designates 200,000 shares of the preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company as “Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock” (the “Preferred Shares”), and the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights of the Preferred Shares and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, be, and they hereby are, as set forth below:</p>
          <p id="s1p14">Section 1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be designated as “Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock” and the number of shares constituting such series so designated shall be 200,000 (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Company convertible into Series A Preferred Stock.</p>
          <p id="s1p15">Section 2. Dividends and Distributions.</p>
          <p id="s1p16">(a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Company, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a “Quarterly Dividend Payment Date”), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) $.25 per share ($1.00 per annum) or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such event the amount to which the holder of each share of Series A Preferred Stock was entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event.</p>
          <p id="s1p17">(b) The Company shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2 immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided, however, that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $.25 per share ($1.00 per annum) on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p18">(c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which event dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend</p>
          <p id="s1p19">2</p>
          <p id="s1p20">Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall cumulate but shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p21">Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:</p>
          <p id="s1p22">(a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event.</p>
          <p id="s1p23">(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter”), in any other certificate of designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Company having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company.</p>
          <p id="s1p24">(c) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.</p>
          <p id="s1p25">Section 4. Certain Restrictions.</p>
          <p id="s1p26">(a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not authorized or declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly:</p>
          <p id="s1p27">3</p>
          <p id="s1p28">(i) 0; authorize, declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions with respect to, any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;</p>
          <p id="s1p29">(ii) 60; authorize, declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions with respect to, any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;</p>
          <p id="s1p30">(iii) 160; redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Company may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Company ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or</p>
          <p id="s1p31">(iv) 60; redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">(b) The Company shall not permit any subsidiary of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration, directly or indirectly, any shares of stock of the Company unless the Company could, under paragraph (a) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.</p>
          <p id="s1p33">Section 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Charter, in any other certificate of designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">Section 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, no distribution shall be made to: (i) the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received the greater of (A) $100.00 per share ($1.00 per one one-hundredth of a share), plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, or (B) an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share of Common Stock to holders thereof; or (ii) the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with</p>
          <p id="s1p35">4</p>
          <p id="s1p36">the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such event the aggregate amount to which each holder of a share of Series A Preferred Stock was entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event.</p>
          <p id="s1p37">Section 7. Consolidation, Merger or Other. In the event the Company shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property or otherwise changed, then in any such event each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Company shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such event the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event.</p>
          <p id="s1p38">Section 8. No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.</p>
          <p id="s1p39">Section 9. Rank. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series or classes of the Company’s Preferred Stock whether issued before or after the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock.</p>
          <p id="s1p40">Section 10. Amendment. The Charter shall not be amended in any manner that would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, as set forth herein, so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.</p>
          <p id="s1p41">5</p>
          <p id="s1p42">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Certificate is executed on behalf of the Company by its President and Chief Executive Officer and attested by its Corporate Secretary this 1st day of October, 1999.</p>
