          <p id="s1p509">Without limiting the choice of law provision set forth in this Lease, the following provisions shall apply to the extent that the laws of the State of Georgia govern the interpretation or enforcement of this Lease with respect to the Properties:</p>
          <p id="s1p510">Lessor and Lessee waive any claim or right they may have to claim that this Lease is or should ever be characterized as &quot;usufruct&quot; under Georgia law.</p>
          <p id="s1p511">Upon an Event of Default, Lessor may avail itself of all rights and remedies provided under applicable Georgia law against Lessee, including without limitation, under the dispossessory scheme codified at O.C.G.A. Section 44-7-50, et seq., as amended. Further, if Lessor chooses to avail itself of a Georgia forum relative to enforcement of its rights under this Lease, then to the extent necessary, Section 17.19 of this Lease shall be deemed amended to permit Lessor to proceed in the applicable Georgia court and to have this Lease governed by Georgia law to the extent necessary to enforce its rights in Georgia.</p>
          <p id="s1p512">Lessor shall be entitled to attorneys' fees on the terms provided in O.C.G.A. Section 13-1-11, et seq.</p>
          <p id="s1p513">To the extent that the State of Georgia now, or in the future, imposes a rental or transfer tax, or any similar tax, against any and all rental payments under this Lease, then Lessee shall be liable for all such taxes, such taxes shall be payable by Lessee upon demand, and such taxes shall be deemed Additional Rental under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p514">The text in Section 12.02(e) shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p515">(e)</p>
          <p id="s1p516">Lessor may terminate this Lease without any right of Lessee to reinstate Lessee's rights by payment of any rentals due under this Lease, including Base Annual Rental and Additional Rental, or other performance of the terms and conditions of this Lease, whereupon Lessee's right to possession of the Properties shall cease (and Lessee shall immediately surrender possession of the Properties to Lessor) and this Lease, except as to Lessee's liability, shall be terminated. Lessee expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under present or future law if this Lease is terminated or if Lessee is evicted or dispossessed by reason of any breach by Lessee of the provisions of this Lease. Upon any termination of this Lease, or upon demand without termination, at Lessor's sole discretion, Lessor may recover from Lessee the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p517">(i)</p>
          <p id="s1p518">All unpaid Rental scheduled to be paid prior to the effective date of the Event of Default; and</p>
          <p id="s1p519">(ii)</p>
          <p id="s1p520">Lessor may accelerate all Rental due from the date of such Event of Default through the end of the Lease Term. Such &quot;Accelerated Rent&quot; shall be deemed liquidated damages hereunder, as Lessor's injury caused by such Event of Default is difficult or impossible to estimate accurately; the parties intend for this &quot;Accelerated Rent&quot; to provide for damages rather than a penalty; and such &quot;Accelerated Rent&quot; is a reasonable pre-estimate of Lessor's probable loss in the event of such Event of Default. Such &quot;Accelerated Rent&quot; amount shall be reduced by the fair market rental amount Lessor reasonably expects to receive if the Properties were relet for the time period to which the &quot;Accelerated Rent&quot; applies, which &quot;Accelerated Rent&quot; amount as so adjusted shall be discounted at a rate equal to the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such &quot;Accelerated Rent&quot; determination, plus 1%; and</p>
          <p id="s1p521">(iii)</p>
          <p id="s1p522">Lessor shall be entitled to any other amounts reasonably necessary to compensate Lessor for all loss, damage and detriment approximately caused by such Event of Default, including without limitation, all court costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
