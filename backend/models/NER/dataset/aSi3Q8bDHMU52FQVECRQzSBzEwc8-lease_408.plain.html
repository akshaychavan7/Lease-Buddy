          <p id="s1p12">WITNESSETH:</p>
          <p id="s1p13">ARTICLE 1</p>
          <p id="s1p14">TERM:</p>
          <p id="s1p15">Tenant and Landlord agree that the Premises shall be leased in phases as set forth below (collectively referred to as the “Phases,” individually referred to as a “Phase”). For and in consideration of the rents, additional rents, terms, provisions and covenants herein contained, Landlord hereby lets, leases and demises to Tenant the right to occupy the Premises commencing on the dates as set forth below:</p>
          <p id="s1p16">Phase One Premises: January 15, 2002 (“Phase One Commencement Date”);</p>
          <p id="s1p17">Phase Two Premises: August 1, 2002;</p>
          <p id="s1p18">Phase Three Premises: February 1, 2003;</p>
          <p id="s1p19">Phase Four Premises: May 1, 2003.</p>
          <p id="s1p20">The term (the “Initial Term”) of this Lease shall commence on the Phase One Commencement Date and shall expire on the date that is sixty-three and one half (63 1/2) months after the Phase One Commencement Date (the “Expiration Date”). The Expiration Date shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to the immediately following paragraph. The Initial Term and any extension thereof are herein collectively sometimes referred to as the “Term” or “Term of this Lease.”</p>
          <p id="s1p21">Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord shall be unable to deliver possession of any of the Phases to Tenant on the date contemplated by Article 2, due to the possession or occupancy thereof by the prior tenant or subtenant, or others not lawfully entitled thereto, Landlord shall use good faith efforts to evict such occupant and to deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant as soon as reasonably practicable. Landlord, using such good faith efforts, shall not in any way be liable for failure to deliver possession of any part of the Premises to Tenant, but, subject to the provision at the end of this sentence, the applicable Phase Commencement Date shall be postponed with respect to the Phase One Premises until the date which is one (1) month after the date on which Landlord tenders possession of the Phase One Premises or with respect to the remaining Phases, the date which is two (2) months after the date which Landlord tenders possession of the applicable portion of the Premises to Tenant and, if necessary, the Term shall be automatically extended so as to include a full sixty-three and one half (63 1/2) months (plus any partial month) following the Phase One Commencement Date; provided, however, if Landlord fails to deliver (a) the Phase One Premises on or before the Phase One Commencement Date; (b) the Phase Two Premises, on or before October 1, 2002; (c) the Phase Three Premises, on or before May 1, 2003; or (d) the Phase Four Premises, on or before November 1, 2003, then in each such event Landlord agrees that Tenant shall receive one day free rent on the square footage of the Phase which is not delivered by the date described above (for example, if the Phase Two Premises are not delivered until October 3, 2002, Tenant will receive two days of free rent on the Phase Two Premises only). Any delay in delivery of any Phase other than Phase One shall not extend the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p22">The Initial Term is subject to extension as provided in Article 42 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p23">ARTICLE 2</p>
          <p id="s1p24">POSSESSION:</p>
          <p id="s1p25">For the purpose of constructing the Tenant Improvements (as defined herein), it is the intention of the parties that Landlord deliver possession of the first floor of the Building approximately one month prior to the Phase One Commencement Date and each other Phase approximately two months prior to the respective Phase Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p26">Landlord shall use its good faith efforts to deliver possession of each Phase to Tenant for the purpose of constructing the Tenant Improvements (as defined herein) and otherwise preparing the Phase for use by Tenant one month prior to the Phase One Commencement Date and two months prior to the other applicable Phase Commencement Date as set forth in Article 1. The date that possession of each Phase is actually delivered to Tenant is herein referred to as the</p>
          <p id="s1p27">2</p>

          <p id="s1p29">Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant to transfer direct billing, or otherwise establish Tenant as the responsible billing party for all utilities consumed for each Phase from and after the respective Phase Delivery Date, to the extent possible prior to Tenant’s occupancy of all four Phases of the Premises. Other than as specifically stated in this Article 2, during each Phase Early Occupancy Period, Tenant shall abide with all other terms and conditions of this Lease, including without limitation, insurance obligations of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p30">ARTICLE 3</p>
          <p id="s1p31">BASE RENT:</p>

          <p id="s1p84">ARTICLE 4</p>
          <p id="s1p85">ADDITIONAL RENT; TAXES AND OPERATING EXPENSES:</p>
          <p id="s1p86">Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent Tenant’s proportionate share of “Taxes” with respect to any calendar year which shall be defined as and comprised of: (i) real estate taxes and annual installments of special assessments due and payable against the Property, and the Building; (ii) any taxes levied or assessed, in whole or in part, in lieu of real estate taxes; (iii) any taxes on the stream of rental income (other than income taxes); (iv) all other taxes or any other federal, state or local governmental charges on the Land, the Building or this Lease levied as part of or in lieu of real estate taxes and assessments; and (v) any sales tax or similar tax assessed or payable in connection with services provided by Landlord hereunder. Tenant shall also pay as Additional Rent any and all Taxes levied or assessed, in whole or in part, based on the value of Tenant’s personal property in the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p87">Tenant shall also pay, as Additional Rent, its proportionate share of all “Operating Expenses” incurred by Landlord during any calendar year. Subject to the exclusions and limitation expressly provided below, Operating Expenses shall include Landlord’s costs of maintaining, repairing and operating the Property and Building including, but not limited to:</p>
          <p id="s1p88">1. janitorial and window washing expenses;</p>
          <p id="s1p89">2. expenses related to operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing any part of the Building including landscaping, planters, paving, curbs, sidewalks, roadways, parking facilities (including all parking lots, garages and ramps), drainage facilities, machines, equipment and lighting facilities;</p>

          <p id="s1p93">6. security expenses;</p>
          <p id="s1p94">7. costs incurred in renting or purchasing equipment necessary or appropriate for the smooth operation of the Property or Building;</p>

          <p id="s1p96">9. wages, salaries and related expenses of all employees engaged in the management, operation, maintenance or security of the Property or Building (to the extent such employees are directly involved in such management, operation, maintenance</p>
          <p id="s1p97">4</p>
          <p id="s1p98">or security, as opposed to the management, operation, maintenance or security of other properties) and the costs of a management office servicing the building;</p>
          <p id="s1p99">10. the cost of all supplies and materials used in the operation and maintenance of the Property or Building;</p>
          <p id="s1p100">11. light bulbs and ballasts;</p>
          <p id="s1p101">12. the cost of maintenance and service agreements for the Building and the equipment therein;</p>
          <p id="s1p102">13. accounting and audit costs;</p>
          <p id="s1p103">14. the cost of all utilities, including, without limitation, water, electricity and gas and the cost of heating, lighting, air conditioning and ventilating the Building;</p>
          <p id="s1p104">15. interior and exterior maintenance expenses including expenses related to maintenance and replacement of the roofs, foundations and structural portions of the Building and the electrical, mechanical, plumbing and other systems and facilities serving the Property or Building;</p>
          <p id="s1p105">16. amortization, on a commercially reasonable basis, of (a) capital improvements and expenditures made to: (i) reduce operating costs, (ii) comply with requirements of Landlord’s insurance carrier that are enacted, or first interpreted to apply to the Property or the Building, after the date of this Lease, or (iii) comply with any law, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority that is enacted, or first interpreted to apply to the Property or the Building, after the date of this Lease, and (b) other costs and expenditures which are appropriately accounted for as capital expenditures.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">The amortized cost of capital improvements and expenditures may, at Landlord’s option, include actual or imputed interest at the rate that Landlord would reasonably be required to pay to finance the cost of the given capital improvement. Landlord’s records regarding Operating Expenses shall be made available to Tenant, at Landlord’s place of business, during normal business hours upon request of Tenant. If the Building does not have one hundred percent (100%) occupancy during an entire calendar year, then the variable cost component of “Operating Expenses” (i.e. the component of Operating Expenses that varies depending upon the occupancy level of the Building) shall be equitably adjusted so that the total amount of Operating Expenses equals the total amount which would have been paid or incurred by Landlord had the Building been one hundred percent (100%) occupied for the entire calendar year. In no event shall Landlord be entitled to receive from Tenant and any other tenants in the Building an aggregate amount in excess of actual Operating Expenses as a result of the foregoing provision.</p>
          <p id="s1p107">Tenant shall pay with its monthly installment of Base Rent the amount Landlord reasonably estimates for Tenant’s proportionate share of all Additional Rent items. When Landlord has determined the actual amounts for each such Additional Rent item, Landlord shall advise Tenant of any additional amounts due from Tenant or any credit due to Tenant. Within thirty (30) days of Tenant’s receipt of such statement, Tenant shall pay the additional amount due</p>
          <p id="s1p108">5</p>
          <p id="s1p109">to Landlord, if any. Tenant shall provide Landlord with written notice of any objection that Tenant may have to any Additional Rent item within one hundred twenty (120) days of the later to occur of (i) the end of the calendar year in which the Additional Rent items are incurred, or (ii) the date upon which Landlord provides Tenant a statement of the actual amount of any Additional Rent item; it being further agreed that in connection with the foregoing, Landlord shall make available to Tenant, at Landlord’s designated office and during normal business hours, Landlord’s books and records maintained with respect to Additional Rent for the applicable calendar year. In the event of a failure to object within such time period, Tenant shall be deemed to waive any further right to object to such Additional Rent. Following Landlord’s review and in the event Landlord agrees with Tenant’s objection, any overpayment shall be credited against the next Additional Rent payment due. If the Term has expired, any overpayment shall be promptly refunded to Tenant and any underpayment shall be promptly paid to Landlord. Landlord may from time to time adjust the monthly installment of estimated Additional Rent charges to more accurately reflect Landlord’s current estimate of such charges. Landlord presently calculates Additional Rent based on a calendar year, and Tenant’s obligation for Operating Expenses and Taxes shall be pro rated on a calendar basis if the calendar year includes any period of time not within the Term. Tenant’s proportionate share shall be based on that portion of the Building that has been delivered to Tenant pursuant to Article 2 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">ARTICLE 5</p>
          <p id="s1p111">COVENANT TO PAY RENT:</p>

The Tenant shall keep and maintain all portions of the Premises in a clean and orderly condition, free of accumulation of dirt and rubbish.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">If Tenant fails, refuses or neglects to maintain or repair the Premises as required in this Lease after notice shall have been given Tenant in accordance with Articles 17 and 32 of this Lease, Landlord may perform such maintenance and/or make such repairs without liability to Tenant for any loss or damage that may accrue to Tenant’s merchandise, fixtures or other property or to Tenant’s business by reason thereof, and upon completion thereof, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all reasonable costs plus 15% for overhead incurred by Landlord in making such repairs upon presentation to Tenant of a bill therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">During the term of this Lease, Landlord shall, at Landlord’s initial cost and expense but subject to Article 4 hereof, keep and maintain in good order, condition and repair, the foundation, exterior walls (except glass or other breakable materials used in structural portions), roof, foundation, and structural portions of the Building and the electrical, mechanical, plumbing and other systems and facilities serving the Building and located outside of the Premises.</p>

          <p id="s1p237">SUBORDINATION:</p>
          <p id="s1p238">This Lease shall be subordinated to any mortgages that may now exist or that may hereafter be placed upon the Premises and to any and all advances made thereunder, and to the interest upon the indebtedness evidenced by such mortgages, and to all renewals, replacements and extensions thereof. Landlord acknowledges that the Premises are currently subject to a mortgage with Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company of Michigan. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a Subordination, Nondisturbance and Attornment (SNDA) Agreement executed on behalf of Landlord, Tenant and such mortgagee in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Tenant. In the event of execution by Landlord after the date of this Lease of any such mortgage, renewal, replacement or extension, Tenant agrees to execute a subordination agreement with the holder thereof which agreement shall provide that:</p>
          <p id="s1p239">18</p>
          <p id="s1p240">a. Such holder shall not disturb the possession and other rights of Tenant under this Lease so long as Tenant is not in default hereunder,</p>
          <p id="s1p241">b. In the event of acquisition of title to the Premises by such holder, such holder shall accept the Tenant as Tenant of the Premises under the terms and conditions of this Lease and shall perform all the obligations of Landlord hereunder, and</p>
          <p id="s1p242">c. The Tenant shall recognize such holder as Landlord hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p243">Tenant shall, within fifteen (15) days following receipt of a written request from Landlord therefor, execute and deliver to Landlord or to any proposed holder of a mortgage or trust deed, or to any proposed purchaser of the Premises, a certificate in recordable form, certifying that this Lease is in full force and effect, and that there are no offsets against rent nor known defenses to Tenant’s performance under this Lease, or setting forth any such offsets or defenses claimed by Tenant as the case may be.</p>

Tenant shall seek such consent of Landlord by a written request therefor, setting forth such information as Landlord may deem reasonably necessary. Landlord agrees not to withhold or delay consent unreasonably. Landlord shall not be deemed to be acting unreasonably if its mortgagee has a right to provide or withhold consent and refuses to consent. Consent by Landlord to any assignment of this Lease or to any subletting of the Premises shall not be a waiver of Landlord’s rights under this Article as to any subsequent assignment or subletting. Landlord’s rights to assign this Lease are and shall remain unqualified. No such assignment or subleasing shall relieve the Tenant from any of Tenant’s obligations in this Lease contained, nor shall any assignment or sublease or other transfer of this Lease be effective unless the assignee, subtenant or transferee, shall at the time of such assignment, sublease or transfer, assume in writing for the benefit of Landlord, its successors or assigns, all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease thereafter to be performed by Tenant and shall agree in writing to be bound thereby. Should Tenant assign or sublease in accordance with the terms of this Lease to a non-affiliate third party, fifty percent (50%) of the excess of any subrent or assignment consideration received by Tenant over the Base Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease (after Tenant has recouped its costs and expenses of obtaining such subtenant or assignee) shall be forwarded to and retained by Landlord, which increase shall be in addition to the Base Rent and Additional Rent due Landlord under this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p249">interests of Tenant which results in more than 50% of such interests being held other than as held on the date of this Lease shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease which shall require Landlord’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

Tenant shall execute, on demand, any attornment agreement required by any such party to be executed, containing such provisions and such other provisions as such party may require.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, Landlord, in the event of a sale of the Premises, shall cause to be included in the agreement of sale and purchase a covenant whereby the purchaser of the Premises assumes and agrees to carry out all of the covenants and obligations of Landlord herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p256">The Tenant agrees at any time and from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written request by the Landlord to execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Landlord a statement in writing certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect or in full force and effect as modified and stating the modifications; that Landlord is not, to Tenant’s knowledge, in default hereunder or specifically stating any alleged defaults; the amount of the Base Rent and the dates through which the Base Rent and Additional Rent items have been paid; and certifying to such other matters as Landlord may reasonably request.

          <p id="s1p385">ARTICLE 42</p>
          <p id="s1p386">EXTENSION OPTIONS:</p>
          <p id="s1p387">Tenant shall have the right to extend the term of this Lease for two (2) additional terms of three (3) years each (each such 3-year period, an “Option Term”) by giving written notice of such extension to Landlord not more than two (2) years nor less than nine (9) months daysprior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the first Option Term, as applicable, of this Lease, time being of the essence hereof; provided that, at the date of expiration of the Initial Term this Lease shall be in full force and effect and no material or monetary default by Tenant shall exist after expiration of the applicable cure period following notice. If Tenant shall give notice to Landlord of its election to extend the term of this Lease for an Option Term but a material or monetary default (after written notice and expiration of applicable cure period) shall exist on the date of the expiration of the Initial Term or the first Option Term, as applicable, Landlord, at its option, may extend the term of this Lease for the applicable Option Term. The Lease for each Option Term shall be on the same terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Lease except that the Base Rent for each Option Term shall be equal to the Market Rent for the Premises determined as of the commencement of the applicable Option Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p388">Within thirty (30) days after receipt by Landlord of Tenant’s notice exercising Tenant’s right to extend the term of this Lease for the Option Term, as provided above, Landlord shall give Tenant notice of Landlord’s determination of the Market Rent (as herein defined) for the Premises. If Tenant disagrees with Landlord’s determination of the Market Rent for the Premises, Tenant shall give notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days after the date of Landlord’s notice, time being of the essence. Upon receipt of such notice, Landlord and Tenant shall for a period of thirty (30) days or such longer period on which Landlord and Tenant may agree (the “Negotiation Period”) negotiate in good faith in an attempt to reach agreement upon the Market Rent for the Premises. If at the end of the Negotiation Period, Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Market Rent for the Premises, then the Market Rent for the applicable Option Term shall be determined by appraisal, made by a Board consisting of three reputable real estate appraisers, each of whom shall be a Member of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers with the designation of “MAI,” shall be experienced in the appraisal of commercial real estate in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and shall have no Disqualifying Interest (as defined herein). One appraiser shall be appointed by Landlord or its representative and one appraiser shall be appointed by Tenant or its representative. The third appraiser shall be appointed by the first two appraisers. If the first two appraisers are unable to agree on a third appraiser within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the second appraiser, or if either party refuses or neglects to appoint an appraiser as herein provided within twenty (20) days after the appointment of the first appraiser, then such third appraiser or such second appraiser whose appointment was not made as aforesaid shall be appointed by the then President of the Minnesota chapter of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers or such successor body hereafter constituted exercising similar functions, unless such President shall have a direct or indirect financial or other business interest in or in common with any of the parties hereto (a “Disqualifying Interest”), in which case the third appraiser or such other appraiser whose appointment was not made as aforesaid shall be appointed by the then next highest ranking officer of the Minnesota chapter of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers or such successor body who shall not have a disqualifying interest. If the Market Rent determination of</p>
          <p id="s1p389">28</p>
          <p id="s1p390">at least two of the appraisers shall be identical in amount, that amount shall be final and binding on both Landlord and Tenant. If the determinations of all three appraisers shall be different, the Market Rent shall be the average of the two determinations which are closest to each other.</p>
          <p id="s1p391">If the Market Rent for the Leased Premises for the Option Term has not been agreed to by Landlord and Tenant or determined by the Board as hereinabove provided by the expiration of the Initial Term or immediately prior Option Term, as applicable, pending resolution of such dispute, Annual Base Rent during the period the dispute remains unresolved shall be payable as set forth in Landlord’s notice. Within fourteen (14) days after resolution of such dispute, the amounts paid by Tenant shall be adjusted by payment to the appropriate party such that all amounts paid equal amounts properly due as determined by the Board. Landlord and Tenant shall each act promptly and diligently in causing determinations to be made under this Article. Landlord and Tenant shall share equally the costs and expenses of the Board. For purposes of this Lease the term “Market Rent” means the annual amount of rent determined as of the commencement of the Option Term, exclusive of operating costs and other items of additional rent, that a willing tenant would pay and a willing landlord would accept in “as is - where is” condition, assuming a lease containing the same terms and conditions as those contained in this Lease, taking into account that Landlord will not be providing any leasehold improvements or paying any leasing commissions and that Tenant will not be paying any leasing commissions or incurring any relocation expenses. The rights of Tenant under this Article shall not be severed from this Lease or separately sold, assigned or otherwise transferred, and shall expire not later than the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p392">If Tenant exercises the Option Term, Landlord agrees to pay a tenant improvement allowance to Tenant for improvements to the Premises in the amount equal to $15.00 per rentable square foot of the Premises minus the amount of the tenant improvement allowance previously paid to Tenant under Article 9 hereof. Such tenant improvement allowance shall be paid pursuant to Exhibit C attached hereto and incorporated herein.</p>

          <p id="s1p424">1. The Work. Under the Lease, Tenant has agreed to accept the Premises “as is,” without any obligations for the performance of improvements or other work by Landlord, and Tenant desires to perform certain improvements thereto (the “Work”). Such Work shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and to the extent not expressly inconsistent herewith, in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Performance of the Work shall not serve to abate or extend the time for the commencement of Rent under the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p425">2. Cost of the Work. Except as provided hereinafter, Tenant shall pay all costs (the “Costs of the Work”) associated with the Work whatsoever, including without limitation, all permits, inspection fees, fees of space planners, architects, engineers, contractors and other consultants, utility connections, the cost of all labor and materials, bonds, insurance, and any structural or mechanical work, additional HVAC equipment or sprinkler heads, or modifications to any building mechanical, electrical, plumbing or other systems and equipment or relocation of any existing sprinkler heads, either within or outside the Premises required as a result of the layout, design, or construction of the Work.</p>
          <p id="s1p426">Of the Costs of the Work, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant the amount set forth in the Lease (the “Improvement Allowance”).

          <p id="s1p427">Notwithstanding the foregoing, during construction of improvements on the Phase One Premises and the Phase Two Premises, of the Cost of the Work, Landlord agrees to pay the Improvement Allowance directly to the contractor after the Work has been completed in accordance with the “Space Plan” and “Working Drawings” approved by Landlord in writing in accordance with the provisions hereof, and Tenant has submitted all invoices, lien waivers for any Costs of Work in excess of Improvement Allowance, affidavits of payment for any Costs of Work in excess of Improvement Allowance, and other evidence as Landlord may reasonably require showing that the Cost of the Work has been paid for and that no mechanic’s, materialmen’s or other liens have been or may be filed against the Property or the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p428">C-1</p>
          <p id="s1p429">3. Space Plan and Specifications.</p>

In the event Landlord disapproves said Space Plan, Tenant shall modify the same, taking into account the reasons given by Landlord for said disapproval, and shall submit two sets of the revised Space Plan to Landlord within ten (10) days after receipt of Landlord’s initial disapproval.</p>
          <p id="s1p432">4. Working Drawings.</p>

          <p id="s1p434">B.

          <p id="s1p435">5. Landlord’s Approval. Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold approval of any Space Plans or Working Drawings submitted hereunder (or changes thereto pursuant to Section 7 below) if they provide for a customary office layout, with finishes and materials generally conforming to building standard finishes and materials currently being used by Landlord at the Property, are compatible with the Property’s shell and core construction, and if no modifications will be required for the Property electrical, heating, air-conditioning, ventilation, plumbing, fire protection, life safety, or other systems or equipment, and will not require any structural modifications to the Property, whether required by heavy loads or otherwise.</p>

All Work shall conform with the Working Drawings approved by Landlord in writing, and Landlord may periodically inspect the Work for such compliance.

          <p id="s1p453">K. Landlord’s approval of Tenant’s plans and specifications, and Landlord’s recommendations or approvals concerning contractors, subcontractors, space planners, engineers or architects, shall not be deemed a warranty as to the quality or adequacy of the Work, or the design thereof, or of its compliance with Laws, codes and other legal requirements.</p>

          <p id="s1p458">O.

Tenant shall remove any such lien or encumbrance by bond or otherwise within thirty (30) days after written notice by Landlord, and if Tenant shall fail to do so, Landlord may pay the amount necessary to remove such lien or encumbrance, without being responsible for investigating the validity thereof. The amount paid</p>

          <p id="s1p478">THIS DECLARATION, Made this 8th day of April, 1982, by RAUENHORST CORPORATION, a Minnesota corporation, with its principal place of business at 2200 Northwestern Financial Center, 7900 Xerxes Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55431 (hereinafter called “Declarer”).</p>
          <p id="s1p479">WHEREAS, Declarer is the owner of the premises lying and being in the County of Hennepin, State of Minnesota, described on Exhibit ”A,” attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (“Premises”), and is the owner of other property located in the recorded plat of Opus 2 Fourth Addition (“Other Property”).</p>
          <p id="s1p480">WHEREAS, Declarer is desirous of subjecting said Premises to the conditions, covenants, restrictions and reservations hereinafter set forth to insure development, improvement and use of the Premises acceptance to Declarer so as to:</p>
          <p id="s1p481">(a) Protect Declarer’s Other Property from unacceptable development, improvement and use.</p>
          <p id="s1p482">(b) Guard against erection thereon of structures built of materials unacceptable to Declarer or which are unattractive to Declarer in appearance or design.</p>
          <p id="s1p483">(c) Insure development of the Premises in a form adequate and reasonable to Declarer.</p>
          <p id="s1p484">(d) Provide adequate off-street parking space and loading facilities, sign controls and setbacks; and, in general, to provide a development that will promote the general welfare of the Other Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p485">(Paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), above, are sometimes hereinafter collectively called “Criteria Standards.”)</p>
          <p id="s1p486">NOW, THEREFORE, Declarer hereby declares that the Premises shall be developed in accordance with the following standards and guidelines and in line with the aforementioned Criteria Standards, and shall apply to and bind each and every owner and successor in interest thereof, and are imposed upon the Premises as a servitude in favor of Declarer only for the benefit of Declarer and such assignee of the Declarer as shall be given the right to enforce the provisions hereof by written instrument recorded in the Office of the Registrar of Titles,</p>
          <p id="s1p487">D-1</p>
          <p id="s1p488">Hennepin County, Minnesota, but only if such assignment specifically gives the assignee the right to enforce this Declaration. Mere purchase of the Premises or any of the Other Property shall confer no right to enforce the provisions hereof. Further, such conditions, covenants, restrictions and reservations shall operate as covenants passing with the title to said Premises, and are as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p489">. The following terms and words as used in the context herein shall be defined as follows:ARTICLE I. DEFINITION OF TERMS</p>
          <p id="s1p490">(a) Building Site shall mean any lot, or portion thereof, or two or more contiguous lots, or portions thereof, or a parcel of land upon which an industrial or commercial building or buildings and appurtenant structures may be erected in conformance with the requirements of this Declaration.</p>
          <p id="s1p491">(b) Declarer shall mean Rauenhorst Corporation, its successors and assigns.</p>
          <p id="s1p492">(c) Improvements shall mean and include all construction necessary to erect a building and other improvements or the Premises for a use permitted by the zoning ordinances of the City of Minnetonka, and shall include the building, parking areas, loading areas, driveways, sidewalks, fences, lawns, landscaping and lighting.</p>
          <p id="s1p493">(d) Owner shall mean the party or parties, their heirs, successors or assigns who are in title or claim title to any part or parcel of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p494">(e) Street shall mean a right-of-way dedicated to the public or in respect to which an easement has been granted to the public.</p>
          <p id="s1p495">.ARTICLE II. PERMITTED USES AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS</p>
          <p id="s1p496">(a) No noxious or offensive trades, services or activities shall be conducted on the Premises, nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or become an annoyance or nuisance to Declarer by reason at unsightliness or excessive emission of odors, fumes, smoke, vibration, dirt, dust, glare, waste or noise.</p>
          <p id="s1p497">(b) Without otherwise limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, or of any other term or condition of this Declaration, the permitted uses shall be light industrial, offices, research, assembling or processing, jobbing, wholesaling and uses ordinarily incidental to the operation of a permitted principal use. All uses shall comply with the zoning ordinances of the City of Minnetonka, Minnesota. Said zoning ordinances shall govern if inconsistent herewith to the extent actually inconsistent. If not inconsistent herewith, the standards herein contained shall be considered as requirements in addition to said zoning ordinances. The Premises shall not be used for the following purposes:</p>
          <p id="s1p498">Auto salvage yard; used material yard or any type of exposed open sales or storage of materials, or any use which would create an excessive amount of sewage or a quality of sewage which would cause a disposal problem; or for manufacture, storage or sale of explosives or similar dangerous products.</p>
          <p id="s1p499">D-2</p>
          <p id="s1p500">. Declarer, on the basis of the-experience of others, has learned that to set measured minimum or maximum standards for control of noise, vibration, dirt, dust, smoke, odor, glare and waste within an industrial area is difficult if not impossible. Therefore, in order to protect its interest in the Other Property and to enable Declarer to orderly develop the Other Property, complete architectural and engineering plans for any proposed Improvement to be constructed on the Premises shall be submitted by Owner to Declarer prior to commencement of any development or construction of any Improvement on the Premises. Such plans shall contain the items and information required by Articles IV, V, VI and VII hereof, and shall contain sufficient engineering data to enable Declarer to determine whether or not the proposed Improvement will operate within “safe limits” of noise, vibration, dirt, dust, smoke, odor, glare and waste.ARTICLE III.

          <p id="s1p504">(c) Truck loading and receiving areas shall not be on the street side of any building; provided, however, as applies in the case of other restraints, Declarer reserves the right to review and permit such areas on the street side of any building where the facilities are so screened as to be acceptable to Declarer.</p>
          <p id="s1p505">(d) All off-street parking, driveways and loading areas shall be properly surfaced to control dust and properly graded to assure proper drainage.</p>
          <p id="s1p506">(e) No parking shall be permitted on a side yard abutting a dedicated public street without the written approval of Declarer.</p>
          <p id="s1p507">(f) From and after the date a building is constructed on a Building Site, Owner or Owners of such Building Site shall maintain adequate on-site parking spaces and loading facilities to serve the needs of each such Building Site, taking into account the building or buildings located or to be located thereon, and the use made or to be made thereof, and shall keep such parking areas, driveways and loading areas surfaced with asphalt or concrete and properly kept and maintained at all times.</p>
          <p id="s1p508">(g) No on-street parking or loading will be permitted.</p>
          <p id="s1p509">.ARTICLE V. LANDSCAPING, OUTSIDE STORAGE AND MAINTENANCE</p>
          <p id="s1p510">(a) Sites occupied by a building shall be landscaped in accordance with a plan approved by Declarer.

          <p id="s1p513">(c) The approved plan for landscaping a Building Site may not be altered substantially without submitting a revised plan to Declarer for approval.</p>
          <p id="s1p514">(d) The Premises shall at all times be kept free from debris, paper, excessive leaves, branches and trash of all kinds.</p>
          <p id="s1p515">(e) Outside storage of materials, equipment and products shall be prohibited except as approved by Declarer.</p>
          <p id="s1p516">(f) Nothing shall be done on any Building Site that interferes with the natural drainage of surface waters.</p>
          <p id="s1p517">. Declarer recognizes there is need for signs advertising the identity of Owner and the business conducted on the Premises. It is further recognized that acceptable standards for such signs may change from time to time. In order to allow for such change, all requests for signs to be located on the Premises shall be submitted to Declarer for approval. Declarer shall consider any such application in light of the Criteria Standards set forth herein and other appropriate data, and shall either approve the proposed signs as submitted or require that the proposal be altered so that any signs constructed in connection therewith shall be such as to fulfill the said criteria Standards. In the event Declarer does not disapprove any such sign proposals within thirty (30) days after submission, said approval shall be deemed to have been given; provided, however, that no sign located an the Premises subject hereto shall:ARTICLE VI.

          <p id="s1p522">.ARTICLE VII. PLANS AND BUILDINGS</p>
          <p id="s1p523">(a) No improvements shall be erected, placed or altered on the Premises until the building or other alteration plans, specifications, including front elevations and/or architect’s rendering, and a site plan showing the location of such Improvement on the Premises, including parking, loading and landscape plans, have been submitted to and approved, in writing, by Declarer as to conformity and harmony with existing and planned structures on the Other Property, and as to location of the Improvements on the Building Site, giving due regard to the anticipated use thereof as may affect adjoining structures, use and operations, and as to location of the Improvements with respect to topography, grade and finished ground elevation, and as to</p>

Likewise, any person, firm or corporation that submits plans to Declarer for approval, or becomes an Owner, agrees not to bring any action or suit to recover any damages or other relief against Declarer. Declarer shall not unreasonably withhold approval of any plans submitted pursuant hereto; provided, however, that failure to meet the Criteria Standards or the standards contained herein shall be grounds for Declarer’s reasonable disapproval of any such plans.
