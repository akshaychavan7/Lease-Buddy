          <p id="s1p462">2.1 DEMISE AND LEASE OF PREMISES. Landlord hereby demises and leases to Tenant, and Tenant hereby hires and accepts from Landlord, the Premises in the Building, excluding exterior faces of exterior walls, the common stairways and stairwells, elevators and elevator walls, mechanical rooms, electric and telephone closets, janitor closets, and pipes, ducts, shafts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures serving exclusively or in common other parts of the Building, and if the Premises includes less than the entire rentable area of any floor, excluding the common corridors, elevator lobbies and toilets located on such floor. Tenant hereby agrees with Landlord that, upon not less than ninety (90) days notice from Landlord made after the third anniversary of the Commencement Date, Tenant shall relocate from the Premises then demised to Tenant under this Lease (the Original Premises) to other premises (the Relocated Premises) within the Building and upon such relocation the Relocated Premises shall become the premises demised under this Lease and wherever the term Premises is used herein the same thereafter shall mean and refer to the Relocated Premises. The Relocated Premises shall (i) be on a floor in the Building higher than the floor containing the Original Premises, and (ii) contain similar finishes as the Premises and the same level of fit-out, and approximately the same Rentable Square Footage as the Premises and the same number of work stations, offices, breakrooms and reception areas as are contained in the Premises as of the date Tenant receives Landlords notice of relocation. In no event shall Tenant be required to pay more Annual Fixed Rent or Additional Rent for the Relocated Premises than it would have had to pay for the Original Premises. Landlord, at its sole cost and expense, shall perform the partitioning of the Relocated Premises and shall place the same into substantially equivalent condition to that in which the Original Premises were in prior to such relocation, including all telecommunications wiring and cabling. Landlord shall also reimburse Tenant for Tenants reasonable out-of-pocket moving expenses in so relocating to the Relocated Premises including all costs for moving Tenants furniture, equipment, supplies and other personal property, as well as the cost of printing and distributing change of address notices to Tenants customers and one months supply of stationery showing the new address, upon billing therefor from Tenant (which billing shall include reasonable evidence thereof in the form of paid invoices, receipts and the like). Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant to minimize the disruption to Tenants business caused by the relocation.. Landlord shall also reimburse Tenant for the reasonable cost of the time spent by Tenants employees in connection with the construction of and relocation to the Relocated Premises. Tenant shall not be required to vacate the Original Premises and to relocate to the Relocated Premises until the Relocated Premises shall be demonstrated, to Tenants reasonable satisfaction, to be substantially complete subject to punch list</p>
          <p id="s1p463">5</p>
          <p id="s1p464">items and items of long lead time. Only one such relocation request may be made during the term of this Lease. Upon any such relocation the Tenant shall enter into an amendment to this Lease confirming such relocation, but the Tenants failure to enter into such amendment shall not affect in any manner the relocation of the Premises demised under this Lease from the Original Premises to the Relocated Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p465">2.2 APPURTENANT RIGHTS AND RESERVATIONS.</p>
          <p id="s1p466">(A) Subject to Landlords or any other PruOwners right to change or alter any of the following in Landlords discretion as herein provided, Tenant shall have, as appurtenant to the Premises, the non-exclusive right to use in common with others, but not in a manner or extent that would materially interfere with the normal operation and use of the Building as a multi-tenant office building and subject to reasonable rules of general applicability to tenants of the Building from time to time made by Landlord or any other PruOwner of which Tenant is given reasonable prior notice: (i) the common lobbies, corridors, stairways, and elevators of the Building, and the pipes, ducts, shafts, conduits, wires and appurtenant meters and equipment serving the Premises in common with others, (ii) the loading areas serving the Building and the common walkways and driveways necessary for access to the Building, (iii) if the Premises include less than the entire rentable floor area of any floor, the common toilets, corridors and elevator lobby of such floor and (iv) the plazas and other common areas of the Prudential Center as Landlord or any other PruOwner makes the same available from time to time; and no other appurtenant rights and easements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Landlord has no obligation to allow any particular telecommunication service provider to have access to the Building or to the Premises, but Landlord agrees not to unreasonably withhold its consent to particular providers. If Landlord permits such access, Landlord may condition such access upon the payment to Landlord by the service provider of fees assessed by Landlord in its sole discretion, provided that no such fees shall be assessed unless such service provider provides telecommunication service to more than one tenant in the Building. Landlord agrees that any of the following providers are acceptable to Landlord, and will not be required to pay any such access fees: BellAtlantic; Shared Technologies, Inc., MFS, Comcast, Teleport Communications and Cablevision of Boston.</p>
          <p id="s1p467">(B) Landlord reserves for its benefit and the benefit of any other PruOwner the right from time to time, without unreasonable interference with Tenants use: (i) to install, use, maintain, repair, replace and relocate for service to the Premises and other parts of the Building, or either, pipes, ducts, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures, wherever located in the Premises or the Building, and (ii) to alter or relocate any other common facility, provided that substitutions are substantially equivalent or better. Installations, replacements and relocations</p>
          <p id="s1p468">6</p>
          <p id="s1p469">referred to in clause (i) above shall be located so far as practicable in the central core area of the Building, above ceiling surfaces, below floor surfaces or inside the perimeter walls of the Premises. Except in the case of emergencies, Landlord agrees to use all reasonable efforts to give, or cause such PruOwner to give, Tenant reasonable advance notice of any of the foregoing activities which require work in the Premises. In making any entry into the Premises, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to minimize interference with the Tenants use and enjoyment of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p470">(C) Landlord reserves and excepts for its benefit and the benefit of any other PruOwner all rights of ownership and use in all respects outside the Premises, including without limitation, the Building and all other structures and improvements and plazas and common areas in the Prudential Center, except that at all times during the term of this Lease Tenant shall have a reasonable means of access from a public street to the Premises. Without limitation of the foregoing reservation of rights by Landlord, it is understood that in its sole discretion Landlord or any other PruOwner, as the case may be, shall have the right to change and rearrange the plazas and other common areas, to change, relocate and eliminate facilities therein, to erect new buildings thereon, to permit the use of or lease all or part thereof for exhibitions and displays and to sell, lease or dedicate all or part thereof to public use; and further that Landlord or any other PruOwner, as the case may be, shall have the right to make changes in, additions to and eliminations from the Building and other structures and improvements in the Prudential Center, the Premises excepted; provided however that Tenant, its employees, agents, clients, customers, and invitees shall at all times have reasonably direct access to the Building and Premises. Landlord is not under any obligation to permit individuals without proper building identification to enter the Building after 6:00 p.m.</p>
          <p id="s1p471">2.3 RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER.</p>
          <p id="s1p472">(A) Subject to the provisions of Sections 2.3(C) and 2.3(D) below, provided that at the time that any separately demised portion of the thirty-fifth (35th) floor of the Building (each such portion being referred to as an RFO Space) first becomes available for reletting (i) there exists no Event of Default (defined in Section 15.1), (ii) this Lease is still in full force and effect, and (iii) Tenant has neither assigned this Lease nor sublet more than twenty percent (20%) of the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises (except for an assignment or subletting permitted without Landlords consent under Section 12.2 hereof), Landlord agrees not to enter into a lease to relet the RFO Space without first giving to Tenant an opportunity to lease such space for the RFO Annual Fixed Rent as determined by Landlord. An RFO Space shall be deemed to be available for reletting when Landlord, in its sole judgment, determines that: (x) such RFO Space will be vacated by the tenant of such RFO Space, (y) Landlord intends to offer such area</p>
          <p id="s1p473">7</p>
          <p id="s1p474">for lease, and (z) all rights to lease such RFO Space which are superior to Tenants rights under this Section 2.3 have lapsed unexercised in accordance with this Section 2.3 or have been irrevocably waived. When the RFO Space becomes so available for reletting, Landlord shall notify Tenant of the availability of such space and shall advise Tenant of the RFO Annual Fixed Rent and other business terms upon which Landlord is willing to lease the RFO Space (Landlords Notice). If Tenant wishes to exercise Tenants right of first offer, Tenant shall do so, if at all, by giving Landlord notice (Tenants RFO Exercise Notice) of Tenants desire to lease the entire amount of such space (it being agreed that Tenant has no right to lease less than the entire amount of the RFO Space) on the terms provided herein within fifteen (15) days after receipt of Landlords Notice to Tenant of the availability of such space and Landlords quotation of the RFO Annual Fixed Rent and business terms, time being of the essence. If Tenant shall timely give such notice the same shall constitute an agreement to enter into an instrument in writing to lease such space within thirty (30) days thereafter upon all of the same terms and conditions in this Lease except for the provisions of this Section, the Annual Fixed Rent which shall be equal to the RFO Annual Fixed Rent as quoted by Landlord, such other business terms set forth in Landlords Notice and those provisions hereof which are inappropriate to the business agreement. If Tenant shall fail to timely give Tenants RFO Exercise Notice with respect to an RFO Space, time being of the essence in respect to such exercise, Landlord shall be free for two hundred seventy (270) days after the date of Landlords Notice to Lease such RFO Space, upon economic terms, taken as a whole, not less than ninety percent (90%) of the economic terms, taken as a whole, contained in Landlords Notice, and without again offering such space to Tenant for lease (it being agreed that if Landlord does not so lease such space during such two hundred seventy (270) day period or if Landlord proposes to lease such space upon economic terms, taken as a whole, less than ninety percent (90%) of the economic terms, taken as a whole contained in Landlords Notice during such two hundred seventy (270) day period, the terms of this Section shall continue to apply to the RFO Space).</p>
          <p id="s1p475">(B) If Tenant shall exercise any such right of first offer and if, thereafter, the then occupant of the RFO Space wrongfully fails to deliver possession of such premises at the time when its tenancy is scheduled to expire, commencement of the term of Tenants occupancy and lease of such additional space shall, in the event of such holding over by such occupant, be deferred until possession of the additional space is delivered to Tenant. The failure of the then occupant of such premises to so vacate shall not constitute or default or breach by Landlord and shall not give Tenant any right to terminate this Lease or to deduct from, offset against or withhold Annual Fixed Rent or additional rent (or any portions thereof). However, Landlord agrees to use good faith efforts (which shall be limited to the commencement and prosecution of eviction proceedings but shall not require the</p>
          <p id="s1p476">8</p>
          <p id="s1p477">taking of any appeal) to cause the then occupant of the RFO Space to vacate such space when its tenancy expires.</p>
          <p id="s1p478">(C) As of the date hereof, the entire thirty-fifth (35th) floor of the Building as well as other premises in the Building are leased to The Gillette Company (The Gillette Company, as well as any successor to The Gillette Company which holds the tenants interest under The Gillette Companys lease with Landlord, as such lease may be extended, amended or renewed, being hereinafter referred to as the Existing Tenant). Such existing lease and the term thereof, including, but not limited to, the original term thereof, options to extend the term thereof, any expansion options and any amendments thereto is hereinafter called the Existing Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, Tenants rights to lease the RFO Space shall be subject and subordinate (i) to the Existing Lease and the rights of the Existing Tenant thereunder, and (ii) to any other rights which Landlord may grant to the Existing Tenant in the future, pursuant to amendments to the Existing Lease or otherwise, all of which rights are prior to the rights of Tenant under this Section.</p>
          <p id="s1p479">(D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, and in addition to the prior rights of the Existing Tenant as set forth in the preceding paragraph, Tenants rights to lease the RFO Space shall be subject and subordinate to (i) the rights, as of the Execution Date of this Lease, of any existing tenants (Other RFO Tenants) under existing leases with Landlord (Other RFO Tenant Leases) for space in the Building to lease the RFO Space, and to Landlords right to grant to any Other RFO Tenants a grace period (for the purpose of exercising such rights) of up to an additional thirty (30) days beyond the last day which such Other RFO Tenant has to exercise such rights. Other RFO Tenants include any entity which becomes the holder of the tenants interest under an Other RFO Tenant Lease; and (ii) the right of any tenant of the RFO Space (RFO Existing Tenant) to exercise any right which it has under its lease to extend or renew the term of its lease of the RFO Space. If any Other RFO Tenants or any RFO Existing Tenants lease the RFO Space pursuant to the Prior RFO Rights, Tenant shall have no right to lease such RFO Space pursuant to this Section 2.3 until such space again becomes available for relet, subject to, and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3. Landlord represents that as of the Execution Date hereof, to the actual knowledge of David Provost, Vice President, Leasing, without further inquiry, the only Other RFO Tenants are the Existing Tenant and Digitas LLC.</p>
          <p id="s1p480">(E) Tenants rights under this Section 2.3 shall expire on, and Landlord shall have no obligation to deliver a Landlords Notice to Tenant after, the date that is twelve (12) months prior to the scheduled termination date of this Lease.</p>

Landlord agrees to respond to any such Change Proposal within such time as is reasonably necessary (taking into consideration the information contained in such Change Proposal) after the submission thereof by Tenant, advising Tenant of any anticipated costs (Change Order Costs) associated with such Change Proposal, as well as an estimate of any delay which would likely result in the completion of the Landlords Work if a Change Proposal is made pursuant thereto (Landlords Change Order Response). Tenant shall have the right to then approve or withdraw such Landlords Change Order Response within three(3) days after receipt of such Landlords Change Order Response. If Tenant fails to respond to Landlords Change Order Response within such three (3) day period, such Change Proposal shall be deemed withdrawn. If Tenant approves such Change Proposal, then such Change Proposal shall be deemed a Change Order hereunder and if the Change Order is made, then the Change Order Costs associated with the Change Order, if any, shall be deemed additions to the Tenant Plan Excess Costs and shall be paid in the same manner as Tenant Plan Excess Costs are paid as set forth in Section 4.5.</p>

          <p id="s1p519">(e) Any delay due to changes, alterations or additions required or made by Tenant after Landlord approves Tenants Construction Plans including, without limitation, Change Orders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts shall be due from Tenant pursuant to this Section 4.1(B)(2)(c) unless and until the total cost of Landlords Work, including any increases therein due to Tenant Delay, exceeds the Tenant Allowance, as defined in Section 4.4 hereof.</p>

          <p id="s1p530">(1) LANDLORDS OBLIGATIONS. Subject to Tenant Delays and delays due to Force Majeure, as defined in Section 14.1, Landlord shall use reasonable speed and diligence to have Landlords Work substantially completed on or before the Estimated Commencement Date, but Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for failure so to complete construction of Landlords Work in the Premises, except for the right to terminate this Lease, without further liability to either party, in accordance with the provisions hereinafter specified in Section 4.2.</p>
          <p id="s1p531">(2) DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION. The Premises shall be treated as having been substantially completed on the date that Landlord notifies Tenant</p>
          <p id="s1p532">16</p>
          <p id="s1p533">(which notice may be by facsimile) that both of the following have occurred:</p>
          <p id="s1p534">(a) Landlords Work, together with common facilities for access and services to the Premises, has been completed (or would have been completed except for Tenant Delays, as determined in accordance with Section 4.1(B)(2)(a)) except for Punch List Items, as hereinafter defined, and</p>
          <p id="s1p535">(b) Permission has been obtained (or would have been obtained except for Tenant Delays) from the applicable governmental authority, to the extent required by law, for occupancy by Tenant of the Premises for the Permitted Use.</p>
          <p id="s1p536">In the event of any dispute as to the date on which Landlords Work has been substantially completed, the reasonable determination of Landlords architect as to such date shall be deemed conclusive and binding on both Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p537">Landlord agrees to notify Tenant, from time to time upon Tenants written request, of Landlords estimate of when Landlords Work will be substantially completed.</p>
          <p id="s1p538">(3) PUNCH LIST ITEMS AND INCOMPLETE WORK.</p>
          <p id="s1p539">(a) Punch List Items shall be defined as those items of work and adjustment of equipment and fixtures in the Premises, the incompleteness of which does not cause material interference with Tenants use of the Premises, or access thereto, and which can be completed after Tenant commences its occupancy of the Premises without causing material interference with Tenants use of the Premises or access thereto. The Punch List Items shall be set forth in a so-called punch list prepared and signed by Tenant and Landlord (provided, however, that Landlord and Tenant shall use good faith efforts to arrange for a mutually acceptable time to walk through the Premises and compile the punch list. If despite such good faith efforts Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon a mutually acceptable time, Landlord shall give Tenant reasonable advance notice of the time when Landlord intends to walk through the Premises and compile the punch list, and if Tenant does not accompany Landlord on such walk-through, Tenant shall be bound by the punch list compiled by Landlord).</p>
          <p id="s1p540">(b) Landlord shall complete as soon as conditions practically permit the Punch List items and any long-lead time items which were not complete as of the substantial completion of the Premises, and Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in providing access as may be required to complete such work in a normal manner. Landlord agrees to perform such completion work in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with Tenants use of the Premises, provided, however, that such work shall be performed during normal business hours unless Tenant elects to pay the excess cost for performing such work after normal</p>
          <p id="s1p541">17</p>
          <p id="s1p542">business hours.</p>
          <p id="s1p543">(4) EARLY ACCESS BY TENANT. Landlord shall permit Tenant access for installing Tenants trade fixtures in portions of the Premises prior to substantial completion when it can be done without material interference with remaining work or with the maintenance of harmonious labor relations. Any such access by Tenant shall be at upon all of the terms and conditions of the Lease (other than the payment of Annual Fixed Rent) and shall be at Tenants sole risk, and Landlord shall not be responsible for any injury to persons or damage to property resulting from such early access by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p544">(5) PROHIBITION ON ACCESS BY TENANT PRIOR TO ACTUAL SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION. If, prior to the date that the Premises are in fact actually substantially complete, the Premises are deemed to be substantially complete pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.1 (i.e. and the Commencement Date has therefore occurred), Tenant shall not (except with Landlords consent) be entitled to take possession of the Premises for the Permitted Use until the Premises are in fact actually substantially complete. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord agrees to permit such occupancy of the Premises by Tenant provided that, in Landlords reasonable opinion, such occupancy will not materially interfere with or delay the completion of Landlords Work, nor will such occupancy endanger the safety of persons or property.</p>
          <p id="s1p545">(6) SPECIAL PROVISION CONCERNING POTENTIAL VERIZON STRIKE. The parties acknowledge that the employees of Verizon, a major provider of telecommunication services in the greater Boston area, are threatening to strike imminently. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the parties agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p546">(i) If Tenant submits a work order for Tenants telecommunication services reasonably satisfactory to Landlord on or before September 5, 2003; and</p>
          <p id="s1p547">(ii) The installation and/or connection of Tenants telecommunication services is delayed due to an actual Verizon strike; and</p>
          <p id="s1p548">(iii) As a result, Tenant is unable to use the Premises for the Permitted Use because it lacks telecommunication services; then</p>
          <p id="s1p549">(iv) There shall be no Annual Fixed Rent due hereunder during the period, not to exceed seventy-five (75) days, after the Commencement Date and before Tenant has sufficient telecommunications services to be able to use the Premises for the Permitted Use.</p>

If the Commencement Date shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Completion Date as set forth in Section 1.2 hereof (which date shall be extended automatically for such periods of time as Landlord is prevented from proceeding with or completing the same by reason of Force Majeure as defined in Section 14.1, as well as for any Tenant Delay, without limiting Landlords other rights on account thereof), Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving notice to Landlord of Tenants desire to do so at any time before such completion and within the time period from the Outside Completion Date (as so extended) until the date which is thirty (30) days subsequent to the Outside Completion Date (as so extended); and, upon the giving of such notice, the Term of this Lease shall cease and come to an end without further liability or obligation on the part of either party unless, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, the Commencement Date occurs. Each day of Tenant Delay shall be deemed conclusively to cause an equivalent day of delay by Landlord in substantially completing Landlords Work, and thereby automatically extend for each such equivalent day of delay the date of the Outside Completion Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p553">(B) LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if the Commencement Date does not occur on or before the Outside Damages Date as set forth in Section 1.2 hereof (which date shall be extended automatically for such periods of time as Landlord is prevented from proceeding with or completing the same by reason of Force Majeure as defined in Section 14.1, as well as for any Tenant Delay, without limiting Landlords other rights on account thereof), then Tenant shall be entitled, as liquidated damages which are payable as the result of such delay in the Commencement Date, to a rent credit (Rent Credit), against the first installment(s) of Annual Fixed Rent and other charges payable under the Lease, equal to Two Thousand Four Hundred Eighty-Three and 51/00 Dollars ($2,483.51) times the number of days in the period commencing as of the Outside Damages Date (as it may be extended in accordance with this Paragraph (B)) and terminating on the Commencement Date (determined as set forth in Section 3. hereof). At Landlords sole election, in lieu of giving Tenant the Rent Credit, Landlord may, on or before the date on which Tenant would have been entitled to receive such Rent Credit, pay to Tenant a cash payment in the amount of such Rent Credit. Tenant shall have no right to the Rent Credit or any payments pursuant to this Paragraph (B), if Tenant exercises its right to terminate the Lease pursuant to Section 4.1(A).</p>
          <p id="s1p554">(C) The remedies set forth in this Section 4.2 are Tenants sole and exclusive rights and remedies based upon any delay in the performance of Landlords Work.</p>
          <p id="s1p555">4.3 QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF WORK. All construction work required or permitted by this Lease shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and</p>
          <p id="s1p556">19</p>
          <p id="s1p557">in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, statutes, by-laws, court decisions, and orders and requirements of all public authorities (Legal Requirements) and all Insurance Requirements (as defined in Section 9.1 hereof). All of Tenants work shall be coordinated with any work being performed by or for Landlord and in such manner as to maintain harmonious labor relations. Each party may inspect the work of the other at reasonable times and shall promptly give notice of observed defects. Each party authorizes the other to rely in connection with design and construction upon approval and other actions on the partys behalf by any Construction Representative of the party named in Section 1.2 or any person hereafter designated in substitution or addition by notice to the party relying. Except to the extent to which Tenant shall have given Landlord notice of respects in which Landlord has not performed Landlords construction obligations under this Article IV (if any) not later than the end of the eleventh (11th) full calendar month next beginning after the Commencement Date, Tenant shall be deemed conclusively to have approved Landlords construction and shall have no claim that Landlord has failed to perform any of Landlords obligations under this Article IV (if any). Landlord agrees to correct or repair at its expense items which are then incomplete or do not conform to the work contemplated under the Construction Plans and as to which, in either case, Tenant shall have given notice to Landlord, as aforesaid.</p>
          <p id="s1p558">4.4 SPECIAL ALLOWANCE</p>
          <p id="s1p559">(A) Landlord shall provide to Tenant a special allowance equal to $1,709,240.00, being the product of (i) $65.00 and (ii) the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises (the Tenant Allowance), in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Section 4.4. The Tenant Allowance shall be used and applied by Landlord solely on account of the cost of Landlords Work. In no event shall Landlords obligations to pay or reimburse Tenant for any of the costs of Landlords Work which exceed the total Tenant Allowance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall be under no obligation to apply any portion of the Tenant Allowance for any purposes other than as provided in this Section 4.4.</p>
          <p id="s1p560">(B) In addition, in the event that (i) Tenant is in default under this Lease, or (ii) there are any liens against Tenants interest in the Lease or against the Building or the Site arising out of any work performed by Tenant or any litigation in which Tenant is a party which are not bonded to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord, then, from and after the date of such event (Event), Landlord shall have no further obligation to fund any portion of the Tenant Allowance until such default has been cured or waived in writing or such lien has been released or bonded over to Landlords reasonable satisfaction.</p>
          <p id="s1p561">(C) Further, in no event shall Landlord be required to make application of any portion of the Tenant Allowance on account of any supervisory fees, overhead,</p>
          <p id="s1p562">20</p>
          <p id="s1p563">management fees or other payments to Tenant, or any partner or affiliate of Tenant. In the event that the costs of Landlords Work are less than the Tenant Allowance, Tenant shall not be entitled to any payment or credit nor shall there be any application of the same toward Annual Fixed Rent or Additional Rent owed by Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p564">(D) In addition to the foregoing Tenant Allowance, Landlord shall also provide Tenant with an allowance (Initial Fit Allowance) of up to $2,629.60, being the product of (i) $0.10 and (ii) the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises, toward the cost of initial fit plans.</p>
          <p id="s1p565">(E) Provided that no Event of Default has occurred hereunder at the time that Tenant requests any requisition on account of the Initial Fit Allowance, Landlord shall pay the cost of the work shown on each requisition (as hereinafter defined) submitted by Tenant to Landlord within twenty (20) days of submission thereof by Tenant to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p566">For the purposes hereof, a requisition shall mean written documentation showing in reasonable detail the costs of the initial fit plans prepared for Tenant. Each requisition shall be accompanied by evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord that (if applicable) all work covered by previous requisitions has been fully paid by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p567">(F) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained:</p>
          <p id="s1p568">(i) Landlord shall have no obligation to advance funds on account of the Initial Fit Allowance unless and until Landlord has received the requisition in question.</p>
          <p id="s1p569">(ii) Landlord shall have no obligation to pay the Initial Fit Allowance in respect of any requisition submitted after the date six (6) months after substantial completion of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p570">(iii) Tenant shall not be entitled to any unused portion of the Tenant Allowance of Initial Fit Allowance.</p>
          <p id="s1p571">4.5 PAYMENT OF TENANT PLAN EXCESS COSTS. To the extent, if any, that there are Tenant Plan Excess Costs, Tenant shall pay Landlord the Monthly Improvement Cost Payment (as hereinafter defined), as Additional Rent, in order to repay Landlord for the amount of such Tenant Plan Excess Costs up to the Maximum Amount, as hereinafter defined (the Amortization Amount) as provided herein. However, in the event that the Tenant Plan Excess Costs exceed $525,920.00 (being the product of (i) $20.00 and (ii) the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises) (Maximum Amount), then Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as</p>
          <p id="s1p572">21</p>
          <p id="s1p573">Additional Rent, prior to the commencement of Landlords Work, all such Tenant Plan Excess Costs in excess of the Maximum Amount.</p>
          <p id="s1p574">Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, as Additional Rent, for the Amortization Amount amortized on a direct reduction basis over one hundred twenty-three (123) months at an interest rate of nine percent (9%) per annum in one hundred twenty-three (123) monthly payments (Monthly Improvement Cost Payments) payable on the first day of each month following the Commencement Date (provided that if the Commencement Date is the first day of a month such payments shall commence on the Commencement Date) in the same manner as provided in the Lease for the payment of Annual Fixed Rent. By way of example, if the Amortization Amount equals $262,960.00, Tenant shall make 123 Monthly Improvement Cost Payments of $3,280.96 each.</p>
          <p id="s1p575">Neither the Amortization Amount nor the Monthly Improvement Cost Payments shall be abated or reduced for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, untenantability of the Premises or termination of the Lease). Without limiting the foregoing, the rent abatement provisions of Article XIV of the Lease shall not apply to the Amortization Amount or the Monthly Improvement Cost Payments. Since the payment of the Amortization Amount represents a reimbursement to Landlord of costs which Landlord will incur in connection with the construction of the Premises, if there is any default (beyond the expiration of any applicable grace periods) of any of Tenants obligations under the Lease (including, without limitation, its obligation to pay the Monthly Improvement Cost Payments) or if the term of this Lease is terminated for any reason whatsoever prior to the termination of the term of the Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, immediately upon demand, the unamortized balance of the Amortization Amount. Tenants obligation to pay the unamortized balance of the Amortization Amount shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies which Landlord has based upon any default of Tenant under the Lease, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any credit or reduction in such payment based upon amounts collected by Landlord from reletting the Premises after the default of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p576">4.6 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Landlord represents to Tenant that, to the best of Landlords actual knowledge, the Building was constructed in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Requirements applicable to the Building as of the construction of the Building, and Landlord has not received any notices from any governmental authorities alleging that the Building is currently in violation of any Legal Requirement (except to the extent, if any, that Landlord may have received any such notice and corrected the violation claimed therein). Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to make the common areas of the Building and the Base Building (as hereinafter defined) (including the Base Building areas in the Premises) comply with Legal Requirements, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) requirements of such Legal Requirements resulting from the use of, or</p>
          <p id="s1p577">22</p>

For purposes of this Section 4.6, Base Building shall mean the structural elements of the Building and the heating, ventilating and air conditioning, electrical and plumbing systems and equipment bringing primary service to the tenant spaces in the Building. Landlord agrees that to the extent that Landlord receives notice that the common areas and/or the Base Building are not in compliance with Legal Requirements, Landlord shall, when, if and in the manner permitted or required by Legal Requirements, remedy such non-compliance at its sole cost and expense, except to the extent that the cost of such compliance may be properly included in Operating Expenses..</p>
          <p id="s1p579">Tenant acknowledges that it is preparing the Construction Plans, and that Landlord has no responsibility whatsoever for the compliance of the Construction Plans with Applicable Laws. Landlord agrees to perform Landlords Work in accordance with the Construction Plans. Except to the extent due to Landlords failure to perform Landlords Work in accordance with the Construction Plans, Landlord shall have no responsibility for the compliance of Landlords Work with Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p580">Tenant at Tenants expense shall be responsible for (i) the compliance of any addition, alterations or improvements performed by or for Tenant or any assignee or subtenant of Tenant, including the Landlords Work except to the extent set forth in the preceding paragraph (Tenant Improvements) with the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act (the ADA), and (ii) compliance with the ADA required because of Tenants Specific Use of the Premises (as defined below) or Tenant Improvements. The term Tenants Specific Use of the Premises as used herein shall not refer to the general office use of the Premises, but shall refer to the specific products and operations Tenant and any assignee or subtenant of Tenant use in the Premises and the manner in which Tenant and any assignee or subtenant of Tenant use such products and conduct such operations.</p>

For this purpose, taxes on properties comparable to the Building may be used as a reference if such properties were occupied at ninety-five percent (95%) more or less during the relevant period.</p>

To the extent that the Building is not separately assessed for real estate tax purposes, but is assessed as part of a larger parcel, then the Landlord shall make a reasonable allocation as to the amount of the real estate taxes that should be allocated to the Building for the purposes of determination of the Tenants share of increases in real estate taxes under this Lease. The Landlords allocation, if made in good faith and for which Landlord has a reasonable basis shall be final, absent manifest error, provided that such allocation is consistently applied throughout the Lease.

          <p id="s1p663">(B) Payments by Tenant on account of the Operating Cost Excess shall be made monthly at the time and in the fashion herein provided for the payment of Annual Fixed Rent.

Any balance shown as due to Tenant shall be credited against Annual Fixed Rent next due, or promptly refunded to Tenant if the Lease Term has then expired and Tenant has no further obligation to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p668">Any payment by Tenant for the Operating Cost Excess shall not be deemed to waive any rights of Tenant to claim that the amount thereof was not determined in accordance with the provisions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p669">(D) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, Tenant shall have the right, at Tenants cost and expense, to examine all documentation and calculations prepared in the determination of Operating Cost Excess:</p>
          <p id="s1p670">1. Such documentation and calculation shall be made available to Tenant at the offices where Landlord keeps such records during normal business hours within a reasonable time after Landlord receives a written request from Tenant to make such examination.</p>

          <p id="s1p672">3. Any request for examination in respect of any calendar year may be made no more than one hundred eighty (180) days after Landlord advises Tenant of the actual amount of Operating Expenses for the Building in respect of such calendar year and provides to Tenant the year-end statement required under Paragraph C of this Section 7.5, provided, however, if such examination results in a determination that Tenant was overcharged with respect to a calendar year, then Tenant shall have the right to review Landlords books as to the erroneous items for the two calendar years immediately prior to the calendar year in question.</p>

Without limiting Landlords approval rights, Landlord may withhold its approval of any examiner of Tenant who is being paid by Tenant on a contingent fee basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord agrees that Tenant may retain a third party agent to review Landlords books and records which is not a CPA firm, so long as the third party agent retained by Tenant shall have expertise in and familiarity with general industry practice with respect to the</p>
          <p id="s1p674">35</p>
          <p id="s1p675">operation of and accounting for a first class office building and whose compensation shall in no way be contingent upon or correspond to the financial impact on Tenant resulting from the review.</p>
          <p id="s1p676">5. As a condition to performing any such examination, Tenant and its examiners shall be required to execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement, in form reasonably acceptable to Landlord, agreeing to keep confidential any information which it discovers about Landlord or the Building in connection with such examination, provided however, that Tenant shall be permitted to share such information with each of its permitted subtenants so long as such subtenants execute and deliver to Landlord similar confidentiality agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, if Tenant uses any examiner which is other than a nationally recognized accounting firm, Tenants examiner shall be required to agree that it will not represent any other tenant in the Building or in other buildings located in the Prudential Center which are owned by Landlord or an affiliate of Landlord in connection with reviewing operating expenses for such tenant.</p>

If the results of such examination, as verified by Landlords accountant, show that Operating Expense Excess for the year in question was overstated by more than four percent (4%), then Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable costs of performing such examination.</p>

          <p id="s1p679">(A) NO LIABILITY. Landlord shall give Tenant reasonable advance notice (except in an emergency and except for normal cleaning and maintenance operations) prior to exercising any right which Landlord has to enter the Premises and Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to avoid material interference with Tenants use and enjoyment of the Premises; however, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any compensation or reduction of rent by reason of inconvenience or annoyance or for loss of business arising from the necessity of Landlord or its agents entering the Premises for any purposes in this Lease authorized, or for repairing the Premises or any portion of the Building or Prudential Center however the necessity may occur. In case Landlord is prevented or delayed from making any repairs, alterations or improvements, or furnishing any services or performing any other covenant or duty to be performed on Landlords part, by reason of any cause reasonably beyond Landlords control, including, without limitation, strike, lockout, breakdown, accident, order or regulation of or by any Governmental authority, or failure of supply, or inability by the exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain supplies, parts or employees necessary to furnish such services, or because of war or other emergency, or for any cause due to any act or negligence of Tenant or Tenants servants, agents, employees, licensees or any person claiming by, through or under Tenant,</p>

          <p id="s1p682">(B) STOPPAGE OF SERVICE. Landlord reserves the right to stop any service or utility system, when necessary by reason of accident or emergency, or until necessary repairs have been completed; provided, however, that in each instance of stoppage, Landlord shall exercise reasonable diligence to eliminate the cause thereof as soon as reasonably practicable. Except in case of emergency repairs, Landlord will give Tenant reasonable advance notice of any contemplated stoppage and will use reasonable efforts to avoid unnecessary inconvenience to Tenant by reason thereof.</p>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease contained, if due to Landlords failure to make any repairs, alterations, or improvements required to be made by Landlord hereunder, or to provide any service required to be provided by Landlord hereunder, any portion of the Premises becomes untenantable so that for the Premises Untenantability Cure Period, as hereinafter defined, the continued operation in the ordinary course of Tenants business is materially adversely affected, then, provided that Tenant ceases to use the affected portion of the Premises during the entirety of the Premises Untenantability Cure Period by reason of such untenantability, and that such untenantability and Landlords inability to cure such condition is not caused by the fault or neglect of Tenant or Tenants agents, employees or contractors, Annual Fixed Rent, Tax Excess and Operating Cost Excess shall thereafter be abated in proportion to such untenantability and its impact on the continued operation in the ordinary course of Tenants business until the day such condition is completely corrected. For the purposes hereof, the Premises Untenantability Cure Period shall be defined as five (5) consecutive business days after Landlords receipt of written notice from Tenant of the condition causing untenantability in the Premises, provided however, that the Premises Untenantability Cure Period shall be ten (10) consecutive business days after Landlords receipt of written notice from Tenant of such condition causing untenantability in the Premises if either the condition was caused by causes beyond Landlords control or Landlord is unable to cure such condition as the result of causes beyond Landlords control. The provisions of this Section 7.6(C) shall not apply in the event of untenantability caused by fire or other casualty, or taking.</p>

If Landlord makes or causes such repairs to be made, Tenant agrees that Tenant will forthwith on demand, pay to Landlord as Additional Rent the cost thereof together with interest thereon at the rate specified in Section 16.21, and if Tenant shall default in such payment, Landlord shall have the remedies provided for non-payment of rent or other charges payable hereunder.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to grant security interests and/or to lease its business equipment and personal property in the Premises, provided that such lessor or secured party agrees (or to such other commercially reasonable terms as may be mutually agreed upon by Landlord and such lessor or secured party):</p>

Tenant shall have the right, upon written request to Landlord at any time on or after the date which is three (3) months prior to the expiration of the Lease Term, to ask Landlord if Tenant shall be required to remove such Cable at the termination of the Lease Term.

          <p id="s1p721">PARKING</p>
          <p id="s1p722">10.1 PARKING PRIVILEGES. Landlord shall provide to Tenant monthly parking privileges in the Prudential Center Garage (the Garage) for eighteen (18) passenger automobiles for the parking of motor vehicles, sixteen (16) in unreserved stalls and two (2) in reserved stalls, in the Garage by Tenants employees commencing on the Commencement Date of the Term. Tenants reserved parking stalls shall initially be as shown on Exhibit F attached hereto. Landlord reserves the right to relocate such reserved stalls to another location, provided that (i) the stall numbered 1 on Exhibit F can only be relocated to a stall numbered 2 through 45 as shown on Exhibit F or another location which is approximately equally proximate to the entrance from the Garage to the Building, and (ii) the stall numbered 49 on Exhibit F can only be relocated to a space within the area reserved for reserved parking for tenants of the Building, as Landlord may designate such area from time to time. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has advised Tenant that stall numbered 1 is not located within the reserved gate of the other reserved spaces in the Garage and, notwithstanding signs indicating that such stall is reserved, such space is often utilized by others. Therefore, Tenant</p>
          <p id="s1p723">43</p>
          <p id="s1p724">acknowledges and agrees that Landlord shall have no obligation to police such stall and that Landlords only obligation with respect to such stall is to maintain reserved signage as is in place on the date of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p725">10.2 PARKING CHARGES. Tenant shall pay for such parking privileges at the prevailing monthly rates from time to time charged by the operator or operators of the Garage, whether or not such operator is an affiliate of Landlord, for unreserved and, if applicable, reserved stalls. Such monthly parking charges for parking privileges shall be payable monthly as directed by Landlord upon billing therefor by Landlord or such operator. Tenant acknowledges that said monthly charges to be paid under this Section are for the use by the Tenant of the parking privileges referred to herein, and not for any other service. Tenant shall have the right to cease using any such parking privileges upon thirty (30) days notice to Landlord and such operator, whereupon Tenant shall no longer have any rights to use the relinquished privileges nor any obligation to pay any charges for such privileges accruing after the end of such 30-day period.</p>
          <p id="s1p726">10.3 GARAGE OPERATION. Unless otherwise determined by Landlord or the operator of such garage (the Garage Operator), the Garage is to be operated on a self-parking basis, and Tenant shall be obligated to park and remove its own automobiles, and Tenants parking shall be on an unreserved basis, Tenant having the right to park in any available stalls. Without limiting the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right to operate portions of the Garage, except for Tenants reserved stalls, on an attendant-managed basis, and Tenant shall cooperate with such attendants in parking and removing its automobiles, recognizing that Tenant may be required to leave keys for its vehicles with such attendants while such vehicles are in the Garage. Tenants access and use privileges with respect to the Garage shall be in accordance with regulations of uniform applicability to the users of the Garage from time to time established by the Landlord or the Garage Operator. Tenant shall receive one (1) identification sticker or pass and one (1) magnetic card so-called, or other suitable device providing access to the Garage, for each parking privilege paid for by Tenant. Tenant shall supply Landlord with an identification roster listing, for each identification sticker or pass, the name of the employee and the make, color and registration number of the vehicle to which it has been assigned, and shall provide a revised roster to Landlord monthly indicating changes thereto. Any automobile found parked in the Garage during normal business hours without appropriate identification will be subject to being towed at said automobile owners expense. The parking privileges granted herein are non-transferable (other than to a permitted assignee or subtenant pursuant to the applicable provisions of Article XII hereof). Landlord or the Garage Operator may institute a so-called valet parking program for the Garage, and in such event Tenant shall cooperate in all respects with such program. Landlord reserves for itself and any other PruOwner the right to alter the Garage as it sees fit and in such case to change the Garage including the reduction in area of the same, Tenant</p>
          <p id="s1p727">44</p>
          <p id="s1p728">acknowledging that in connection with the potential expansion of buildings in the Prudential Center or the addition of other buildings thereto, it may be necessary to make significant changes to the Garage which may result in the reduction of the amount of parking available in the Garage and the change of location of such parking or may change the access to or egress from the Garage, all of which Landlord or any other PruOwner may perform in its sole and exclusive discretion, without limitation to its other rights in respect thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p729">10.4 LIMITATIONS. Tenant agrees that it and all persons claiming by, through and under it, shall at all times abide by all reasonable rules and regulations promulgated by Landlord or the Garage Operator with respect to the use of the Garage. Except to the extent of gross negligence or willful acts, neither the Landlord nor the Garage Operator assumes any responsibility whatsoever for loss or damage due to fire or theft or otherwise to any automobile or to any personal property therein, however caused, and Tenant agrees, upon request from the Landlord, from time to time, to notify its officers, employees and agents then using any of the parking privileges provided for herein, of such limitation of liability. Tenant further acknowledges and agrees that a license only is hereby granted, and no bailment is intended or shall be created.</p>

In addition, if Hazardous Materials are discovered in the Building or the Premises which are not caused by Tenant, its employees, invitees, agents, independent contractors, contractors, assignees or subtenants, then Landlord shall, if and as required by law, assess, remediate or remove the same, or cause the same to be assessed, remediated or removed.</p>

As of June 1988, one hundred and twenty-five greater Boston companies provided subsidies for the purchase by their employees of monthly transit passes through this program with subsidies ranging from 10% to 100% of the cost of the transit pass. The provision of transit pass subsidies may also offer certain benefits to employers under tax law.

          <p id="s1p903">15.2 TERMINATION; RE-ENTRY. Upon the happening of any one or more of the aforementioned Events of Default (notwithstanding any license of a former breach of covenant or waiver of the benefit hereof or consent in a former instance), Landlord or Landlords agents or servants may give to Tenant a notice (hereinafter called notice of termination) terminating this Lease on a date specified in such notice of termination (which shall be not less than five (5) days after the date of the mailing of such notice of termination), and this Lease and the Lease Term, as well as any and all of the right, title and interest of the Tenant hereunder, shall wholly cease and expire on the date set forth in such notice of termination (Tenant hereby waiving any rights of redemption) in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if such date were the date originally specified herein for the expiration of the Lease Term, and Tenant shall then quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p904">In addition or as an alternative to the giving of such notice of termination, Landlord or Landlords agents or servants may, by any suitable action or proceeding at law, immediately or at any time thereafter re-enter the Premises and remove therefrom Tenant, its agents, employees, servants, licensees, and any subtenants and other persons, and all or any of its or their property therefrom, and repossess and enjoy the Premises, together with all additions, alterations and improvements thereto; but, in any event under this Section 15.2, Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided.</p>
          <p id="s1p905">The words re-enter and re-entry as used throughout this Article XV are not restricted to their technical legal meanings.</p>
          <p id="s1p906">15.3 CONTINUED LIABILITY; RE-LETTING. If this Lease is terminated or if Landlord shall re-enter the Premises as aforesaid, or in the event of the termination of this Lease, or of re- entry, by or under any proceeding or action or any provision of law by reason of an Event of Default hereunder on the part of Tenant, Tenant covenants and agrees forthwith to pay and be liable for, on the days originally fixed herein for the payment thereof, amounts equal to the several installments of Annual Fixed Rent, all Additional Rent and other charges reserved as they would, under the terms of this Lease, become due if this Lease had not been terminated or if Landlord had not entered or re-entered, as aforesaid, and whether the Premises be relet or remain vacant, in whole or in part, or for a period less than the remainder of the Lease Term, or for the whole thereof, but, in the</p>
          <p id="s1p907">63</p>
          <p id="s1p908">event the Premises be relet by Landlord, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit in the net amount of rent and other charges received by Landlord in reletting, after deduction of all reasonable expenses incurred in reletting the Premises (including, without limitation, remodeling costs, brokerage fees and the like), and in collecting the rent in connection therewith, in the following manner:</p>
          <p id="s1p909">Amounts received by Landlord after reletting shall first be applied against such Landlords expenses, until the same are recovered, and until such recovery, Tenant shall pay, as of each day when a payment would fall due under this Lease, the amount which Tenant is obligated to pay under the terms of this Lease (Tenants liability prior to any such reletting and such recovery not in any way to be diminished as a result of the fact that such reletting might be for a rent higher than the rent provided for in this Lease); when and if such expenses have been completely recovered, the amounts received from reletting by Landlord as have not previously been applied shall be credited against Tenants obligations as of each day when a payment would fall due under this Lease, and only the net amount thereof shall be payable by Tenant. Further, Tenant shall not be entitled to any credit of any kind for any period after the date when the term of this Lease is scheduled to expire according to its terms.</p>
          <p id="s1p910">Landlord agrees to use reasonable efforts to relet the Premises after Tenant vacates the Premises in the event that the Lease is terminated based upon a default by Tenant hereunder. Marketing of Tenants Premises in a manner similar to the manner in which Landlord markets other premises within Landlords control in the Prudential Center shall be deemed to have satisfied Landlords obligation to use reasonable efforts. In no event shall Landlord be required to (i) solicit or entertain negotiations with any other prospective tenants for the Premises until Landlord obtains full and complete possession of the Premises including, without limitation, the undisputed legal right to re-let the Premises free of any claim of Tenant, (ii) relet the Premises before leasing other vacant space in the Building, or (iii) lease the Premises for a rental less than the current fair market rental then prevailing for similar office space in the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p911">15.4 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. Landlord may elect, as an alternative, to have Tenant pay liquidated damages, which election may be made by notice given to Tenant at any time after the termination of this Lease under Section 15.2, above, and whether or not Landlord shall have colleced any damages as hereinbefore provided in this Article XV, and in lieu of all other such damages beyond the date of such notice. Upon such notice, Tenant shall promptly pay to Landlord, as liquidated damages, in addition to any damages collected or due from Tenant from any period prior to such notice and all expenses which Landlord may have incurred with respect to the collection of such damages, such a sum as at the time of such notice represents the amount of the excess, if any, of (a) the discounted present value, at a discount rate of 6%, of the Annual Fixed Rent, Additional Rent</p>
          <p id="s1p912">64</p>
          <p id="s1p913">and other charges which would have been payable by Tenant under this Lease for the remainder of the Lease Term if the Lease terms had been fully complied with by Tenant, over and above (b) the discounted present value, at a discount rate of 6%, of the Annual Fixed Rent, Additional Rent and other charges that would be received by Landlord if the Premises were re- leased at the time of such notice for the remainder of the Lease Term at the fair market value (including provisions regarding periodic increases in Annual Fixed Rent if such are applicable) prevailing at the time of such notice as reasonably determined by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p914">For the purposes of this Article, if Landlord elects to require Tenant to pay liquidated damages in accordance with this Section 15.4, the total rent shall be computed by assuming the Tax Excess under Section 6.2 and the Operating Cost Excess under Section 7.5 to be the same as were payable for the twelve (12) calendar months (or if less than twelve (12) calendar months have been elapsed since the date hereof, the partial year) immediately preceding such termination of re-entry.</p>
          <p id="s1p915">Nothing contained in this Lease shall limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to prove for and obtain in proceedings for bankruptcy or insolvency by reason of the termination of this Lease, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceeds in which, the damages are to be proved, whether or not the amount be greater, equal to, or less than the amount of the loss or damages referred to above.</p>
          <p id="s1p916">15.5 WAIVER OF REDEMPTION. Tenant, for itself and any and all persons claiming through or under Tenant, including its creditors, upon the termination of this Lease and of the term of this Lease in accordance with the terms hereof, or in the event of entry of judgment for the recovery of the possession of the Premises in any action or proceeding, or if Landlord shall enter the Premises by process of law or otherwise, hereby waives any right of redemption provided or permitted by any statute, law or decision now or hereafter in force, and does hereby waive, surrender and give up all rights or privileges which it or they may or might have under and by reason of any present or future law or decision, to redeem the Premises or for a continuation of this Lease for the term of this Lease hereby demised after having been dispossessed or ejected therefrom by process of law, or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p917">15.6 LANDLORDS DEFAULT. Landlord shall in no event be in default in the performance of any of Landlords obligations hereunder unless and until Landlord shall have failed to perform such obligations within thirty (30) days, or such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default, after notice by Tenant to Landlord properly specifying wherein Landlord has failed to perform any such obligation.</p>
          <p id="s1p918">65</p>
          <p id="s1p919">The Tenant shall not assert any right to deduct the cost of repairs or any monetary claim against the Landlord from rent thereafter due and payable, but shall look solely to the Landlord for satisfaction of such claim.</p>
          <p id="s1p920">ARTICLE XVI</p>
          <p id="s1p921">MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</p>
          <p id="s1p922">16.1 WAIVER. Failure on the part of Landlord or Tenant to complain of any action or non-action on the part of the other, no matter how long the same may continue, shall never be a waiver by Tenant or Landlord, respectively, of any of its rights hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p923">Further, no waiver at any time of any of the provisions hereof by Landlord or Tenant shall be construed as a waiver of any of the other provisions hereof, and a waiver at any time of any of the provisions hereof shall not be construed as a waiver at any subsequent time of the same provisions. The consent or approval of Landlord or Tenant to or of any action by the other requiring such consent or approval shall not be construed to waive or render unnecessary Landlords or Tenants consent or approval to or of any subsequent similar act by the other.</p>
          <p id="s1p924">No payment by Tenant, or acceptance by Landlord, of a lesser amount than shall be due from Tenant to Landlord shall be treated otherwise than as a payment on account. The acceptance by Landlord of a check for a lesser amount with an endorsement or statement thereon, or upon any letter accompanying such check, that such lesser amount is payment in full, shall be given no effect, and Landlord may accept such check without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which Landlord may have against Tenant. Further, the acceptance by Landlord of Annual Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other charges paid by Tenant under this Lease shall not be or be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any default by Tenant, whether or not Landlord knows of such default, except for such defaults as to which such payment relates.</p>
