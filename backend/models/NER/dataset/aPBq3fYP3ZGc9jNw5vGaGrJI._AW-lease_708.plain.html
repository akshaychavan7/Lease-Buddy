          <p id="s1p53">Income Tax Gross Up Assistance</p>
          <p id="s1p54">Some of the reimbursements and allowances in the program are tax deductible expenses. Certain expenses, however, will be regarded as taxable income to you. To help offset this extra tax expense, certain payments for which you are not permitted to take a corresponding deduction on your personal tax return(s) will be “grossed up.” This means that a special income tax allowance will be calculated to cover those provisions. The miscellaneous expense allowance and home sale bonus will not be grossed up.</p>
          <p id="s1p55">The following gross up percentages will be used for your relocation expenses:</p>
          <p id="s1p56">• 33% plus the highest state tax rate.</p>
          <p id="s1p57">The rates listed above are intended to approximate your additional tax liability. They are not intended to be precise. If you can demonstrate that the policy results in a material (over $1,000) underpayment of taxes as a result of the relocation, a supplemental claim will be considered.</p>
          <p id="s1p58">The 1.45% tax for Medicare will be reimbursed.</p>
          <p id="s1p59">FICA will be paid on relocation expenses if you have not reached the maximum 2008 FICA salary cap.</p>
          <p id="s1p60">Return to Origin</p>
          <p id="s1p61">In the unlikely event that you decide to return to the Pasadena, CA area (the origination point of your transfer), Regency will provide relocation support services at a level equivalent to the support provided for your move from Pasadena to Jacksonville, FL.</p>
          <p id="s1p62">This offer for return to origin relocation assistance is only valid if you elect to return to the Pasadena, CA area between the 13th and 24th month after the completion of your transfer to Jacksonville.</p>
          <p id="s1p63">Should you resign without Good Reason or be terminated for Cause, within one year of your return move to the Pasadena, CA area, or your household move date, whichever is later, you will forfeit any remaining payments due under this program (including tax assistance) and you will reimburse the company all relocation expenses paid through this program.</p>
