          <p id="s1p121">The Demised Premises include all fixtures, improvements, additions, and other property installed therein at the commencement of, or at any time during, the term of this Lease (other than Tenant’s Personal Property as defined in Section 10). This Lease also gives to Tenant the appurtenant right to the use of the lobbies, entrances, stairs, elevators, parking garage and other public portions of the Building and of the land on which the Building is located and the driveway from the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">2. TERM.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">(a) Basic-Term. The basic term (“Basic Term”) of this Lease shall be for a period of one (1) year, commencing on the Commencement Date of September 1, 2005 and expiring at midnight on the day (the “Expiration Date”) of August 31, 2006 unless sooner terminated pursuant to any of the provisions, covenants or conditions of this Lease. The Basic Term is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Demised Term.”</p>
          <p id="s1p124">(b) Commencement Date. The Commencement Date of this Lease shall be September 1, 2005.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">(c) Substantial Completion. (intentionally omitted)</p>
          <p id="s1p126">(d) Confirmation of Commencement Date. When a Commencement Date has been established in accordance with subparagraph (a) hereof, Landlord and Tenant shall, at the request of either, execute an instrument in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord setting forth said Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p127">(e) Recordation. This Lease shall not be filed for record with the recorder’s office of the county in which the Demised Premises are located.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">3. RENT. Tenant hereby covenants to pay Landlord throughout the Basic Term rent at the annual rate set forth on the cover page hereof payable in equal monthly installments in the amounts set forth on the summary page hereof (“Base Rent”) and Additional Rent as provided in Section 7, without deduction or offset, payable in advance on or before the first day of each month, in lawful money of the United States, without notice or demand, at the address stated hereinabove, or to such other party or at</p>
          <p id="s1p129">1</p>
          <p id="s1p130">such other place as Landlord may hereafter from time to time designate in writing, except that rent for the first month of full Base Rent will be paid upon the execution hereof and will be applied against such Base Rent when the same becomes due and payable. Base Rent, Additional Rent, and all costs and expenses and other amounts which Tenant assumes or agrees or is obligated to pay pursuant to this Lease shall be deemed to be and are collectively referred to herein as “Rent”, and in the event of non-payment of all or any part thereof Landlord shall have all the rights and remedies herein provided for in case of non-payment of Rent. Base Rent and Additional Rent for any part of a month at the beginning or end of the Demised Term shall be prorated. The covenant to pay Rent is independent of any other covenant, agreement, term, or condition of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">If the Commencement Date shall occur on other than the first day of a calendar month, Tenant shall on or before the Commencement Date pay Landlord a proportionate amount of the monthly installment of Base Rent from the Commencement Date to the end of such calendar month.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">4. USE. The Demised Premises shall be used only for the use set forth on the summary page hereof (“Permitted Use”) and for no other business or purpose. No act shall be done in or about the Demised Premises that is unlawful or that will increase the existing rate of insurance on the Building or that is prohibited by or causes a cancellation of any insurance policy covering the Building or any part thereof or any of its contents. Tenant shall not commit or allow to be committed any waste upon the Demised Premises, or any public or private nuisance or other act or thing which disturbs the quiet enjoyment of any other tenant in the Building. Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of Landlord, use any apparatus, machinery or device in or about the Demised Premises which will overload the Building or any portion thereof or which will cause any substantial noise or vibration or fumes. If any of Tenant’s office machines and equipment should create noise, vibration, fumes or otherwise disturb the quiet enjoyment of any other tenant in the Building, then Tenant shall provide adequate insulation, or take such other action as may be necessary to eliminate the disturbance. Tenant shall comply with all laws relating to its use or occupancy of the Demised Premises and shall observe such reasonable rules and regulations as may be adopted and made available to Tenant by Landlord from time to time for the safety, care and cleanliness of the Premises and the Building, and for the preservation of good order therein. The rules and regulations in effect at the time of the making of this Lease are attached hereto as Exhibit “F” and are subject to change by Landlord from time to time, which changes shall be effective not sooner than ten (10) days following written notice thereof to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">5. SERVICES AND UTILITIES. Landlord shall maintain or cause to be maintained the public and common areas of the Building, such as lobbies, elevators, stairs, corridors, and restrooms, in good order and condition except for damage occasioned by any act or omission of Tenant, the repair of which damage shall be paid for by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">As long as Tenant is not in default with respect to any of the provisions, covenants or conditions of this Lease on Tenant’s part to be performed, and subject to the provisions of this Section 6, Landlord will provide the following services to the Demised Premises:</p>
          <p id="s1p135">(a) from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays (“Normal Business Hours”) and from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays (“Saturday Mornings”) (excluding legal and, if applicable, union holidays), Landlord shall furnish the Demised Premises with water, electric, heat and air-conditioning and elevator service;</p>
          <p id="s1p136">(b) during all other hours, Landlord shall furnish such services except for heat and air-conditioning. Landlord shall also provide light replacement service in the public and common areas of the Building only, toilet room supplies, window washing at reasonable intervals, and customary</p>
          <p id="s1p137">2</p>
          <p id="s1p138">building janitorial service, as specified in Exhibit “G” attached hereto and made a part hereof. Landlord agrees to employ a bonded or insured janitorial service company. No janitorial service shall be provided on Saturdays, Sundays or union or legal holidays. The costs of any janitorial services or any other types of services provided or caused to be provided by Landlord to Tenant which are in addition to services ordinarily provided Building tenants, shall be payable as Additional Rent by Tenant at Landlord’s then established rates. Overtime HVAC service shall be provided to the floor on which the Demised Premises are located upon twenty-four (24) hours’ prior notice to Landlord and shall be paid for by Tenant as Additional Rent at the rates therefor established by Landlord from time to time. If more than one (1) tenant on a multi-tenant floor requests overtime HVAC service, the charge therefor shall be apportioned among the tenants requesting such service. Replacement of bulbs and tubes in the Demised Premises shall be provided by Landlord and paid by Tenant at such reasonable rates as Landlord shall establish from time to time.</p>
          <p id="s1p139">Electricity (other than for the electricity utilized by the air conditioning compressors and fans and water for the common areas of the Building) shall be included in the Operating Costs defined in Section 6(b)(v) hereinafter. Electricity for lighting, for operation of customary office machines and for heating and ventilating of the Demised Premises (the “Standard Electric Costs”) shall be metered pursuant to a meter maintained by Landlord at Tenant’s expense. Tenant shall also pay a pro rata share of the costs for electricity utilized by the air conditioning compressors and fans for the entire Building (the “Air Conditioning Electric Costs”), calculated on a per square foot basis in accordance with the same ratio as Tenant’s pro rata share of Operating Expenses. Tenant’s pro rata share of Standard Electric Costs and Tenant’s pro rata share of the Air Conditioning Electric Costs shall be paid for by Tenant within ten (10) days following Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s invoice therefor at the then average rate paid by Landlord to the public utility company selected by Landlord to furnish electricity in the Building, including all surcharges, taxes, fuel adjustments, transfer charges, meter reading or similar charges regularly passed on by the public utility furnishing electricity to the Building. If the Demised Premises is less than a full floor, Landlord may elect only to install a single meter on the floor, in which case the cost of such meter and of the electricity on the floor shall be apportioned equitably in such a manner as Landlord shall determine among the tenants on such floor.</p>
          <p id="s1p140">Landlord shall not be liable for any loss, injury or damage to Tenant or its or any other property caused by or resulting from any variation, interruption, or failure of such services due to any cause whatsoever, or from failure to make any repairs or perform any maintenance, or incident to the making and performance thereof, nor shall the same constitute an eviction of Tenant or relieve Tenant from any of Tenant’s obligations hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p141">Tenant shall abide by all regulations and requirements prescribed by Landlord for the proper functioning and protection of the Building’s heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system.</p>
          <p id="s1p142">Before installing any equipment and lights which generate an undue amount of heat in the Demised Premises (equipment and lights which generate in excess of 1.75 watts per square foot), or before Tenant uses any high power usage equipment in the Demised Premises (i.e., equipment with power requirements equal to or in excess of 220 volt single phase 30 amperes) or before Tenant shall affect the temperature otherwise maintained by the air-conditioning system, Tenant shall obtain the prior written permission of Landlord. Landlord may refuse to grant such permission unless Tenant shall agree to pay the costs of Landlord for installation of supplemental air-conditioning capacity or electrical systems as necessitated by such equipment. In addition, Tenant shall pay Landlord, in advance, on the first day of each month during the Demised Term, the reasonable amount estimated by Landlord as the cost of operation and maintenance of supplementary air-conditioning as necessitated by Tenant’s use of</p>
          <p id="s1p143">3</p>
          <p id="s1p144">such equipment. The Rent stated in Section 3 hereof does not include any amount to cover the cost of furnishing additional air-conditioning for such purposes, and such costs shall be payable by Tenant as Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">Landlord may in its discretion install and operate at Tenant’s cost a monitoring/metering system in the Demised Premises to measure the added demands on heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems resulting from Tenant’s heat generating high power equipment usage, and after hours service requirements and Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent the cost of providing any such additional heating, ventilating or air-conditioning to the Demised Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p146">Landlord shall have the same rights with respect to non-payment of amounts due from Tenant for any of the above-described additional services it has with respect to the non-payment of Rent hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">6. ADJUSTMENT OF RENT.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">(a) Additional Rent. The annual Base Rent provided for in Section 3 shall be increased to the extent and in the manner provided herein to reflect increases in (i) real estate taxes and (ii) operating expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p149">(b) Definition. For the purpose of this Section:</p>
          <p id="s1p150">(i) The term “Base Operating Cost Per Square Foot” is agreed to be the Operating Costs for Calendar Year 2005.</p>
          <p id="s1p151">(ii) The term “Base Tax Per Square Foot” is agreed to be $1.90 per Square Foot.</p>
          <p id="s1p152">(iii) The term “Building” means the structure constructed in which the Demised Premises are situated and referred to in Section 1.</p>
          <p id="s1p153">(iv) The “Estimated Operating Cost Per Square Foot” and the “Estimated Tax Per Square Foot” for each current calendar year during the Demised Term shall be determined by dividing the total of all estimated Operating Expenses (as defined below) and the total of all estimated Real Estate Taxes, respectively, for such calendar year by the Rentable Area of the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p154">(v) The term “Base Operating Costs” as used herein, shall mean the Operating Expenses for Calendar Year 2005, excluding the following: 1) snow and ice removal in excess of $.02 per RSF, 2) costs of security in excess of $.13 per RSF, whether such excess costs arise from additional security services, additional equipment or fixtures or other measures designed to improve security in excess of that provided as of the date of this Lease, 3) insurance deductibles and uninsured costs related to floods, casualty, acts of God, acts of war and other similar events, 4) costs of compliance with laws, regulations, ordinances and other legal requirements, and interpretations thereof, not in effect on the date hereof, including, without limitation, any portion of such compliance included in Operating Expenses under this subsection thereof and 5) other costs of responding to emergency or dangerous conditions.

Commencing in the first calendar year in which the Estimated Tax per Square Foot shall exceed the Base Tax Per Square Foot, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent for such calendar year an amount equal to such excess per rentable square foot multiplied by the Rentable Area of the Demised Premises, which amount shall be payable within thirty (30) days from the sending of such statement. Effective as of January 1 of the immediately following calendar year, and as of January 1 of each subsequent calendar year in respect of which a rental adjustment for Real Estate Taxes shall be payable, the monthly installment of Base Rent shall be increased by an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the prior year’s rental adjustment for Real Estate Taxes payable by Tenant, which amount shall be applied on account of the rental adjustment for Real Estate Taxes payable by Tenant in respect of the then current calendar year; if the aggregate of such monthly amounts so paid on account for such calendar year shall be less than the amount of the rental adjustment for Real Estate Taxes payable by Tenant hereunder with respect to such year, the deficiency shall be payable by Tenant within thirty (30) days from the sending of a statement of such deficiency by Tenant; and if Tenant shall have paid an excess, it shall be applied on account of rent due or next to become due from Tenant to Landlord, or if the Demised Term has expired under this Lease and Tenant is or was not in default, such excess shall be paid by Landlord to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the date of such statement.</p>

Any adjustment required by such decision shall be made within thirty (30) days after such decision has been rendered. The expenses involved in such determination shall be borne by the party against whom a decision is rendered by said accountant or, if more than one item is disputed, the expenses shall be apportioned according to the number of items decided against each party. If Tenant shall not so dispute any item or items of any such statement within forty-five (45) days after such statement has been rendered, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved such statement. Landlord shall have the right, for a period of twenty-four (24) months after the rendering of any statements to send corrected statements to Tenant, and any Rent adjustments required thereby shall be made within thirty (30) days thereafter. This obligation shall survive the termination of this Lease. Pending the determination of any dispute, Tenant shall promptly pay its share of the increase as demanded by Landlord, and after such determination any increase or decrease so determined shall be paid within thirty (30) days.

Tenant shall have no access to the telephone closets within the Building, except in the manner and under procedures established by Landlord. Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord of any actual or suspected failure of telephone or data service to the Premises. All costs incurred by Landlord for the installation, maintenance, repair and replacement of telephone wiring within the Building shall be an Operating Expense unless Landlord is reimbursed for such costs by other tenants of the Building.

Nothing contained in this Section 13 shall be deemed to impose any obligation upon Landlord not expressly stated elsewhere in this Lease. When reasonably necessary, Landlord may temporarily close entrances, doors, corridors, elevators or other facilities without liability to Tenant by reason of such closure and without such action by Landlord being construed as an eviction of Tenant or release of Tenant from any duty of observing and performing any of the provisions of this Lease. Landlord shall have the right upon reasonable notice to Tenant to enter the Premises for the purpose of showing the Demised Premises to prospective tenants within the period from (a) the dates established for Tenant’s notice of election to not extend the term until the dates then established for termination or (b) in the event of early termination, one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date set for such early termination.</p>

          <p id="s1p200">(a) Assignment or Sublease. Tenant shall not assign, transfer, mortgage or encumber this Lease nor sublet the whole or any part of the Demised Premises without in each case first obtaining Landlord’s written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided however it shall not be deemed unreasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent if (i) the business, proposed use, reputation or financial condition of the proposed assignee or subtenant is not satisfactory to Landlord in the exercise of its reasonable judgment, or (ii) the proposed rental under a sublease is for less than the then asking Rent in the Building unless such sublease is to an affiliate of Tenant, or the Building is then 95% occupied. Any of the foregoing acts without such consent of Landlord shall be void and shall, at the option of Landlord, constitute a default that entitles Landlord to terminate this Lease. Should Landlord grant such consent no such assignment or subletting shall relieve Tenant of any liability under this Lease. Consent to any such assignment or subletting shall not operate as a waiver of the necessity for consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting, and the terms of such consent shall be binding upon any person holding by, under or through Tenant. In addition to and not in limitation of the foregoing in the event Landlord grants Tenant Landlord’s consent to sublease all or a portion of the Demised Premises, the terms of such lease shall not permit rental or other payments for such use or occupancy to be based in whole or in part on the net income or profit derived by any person from the premises subleased, used or occupied.</p>
          <p id="s1p201">(b) Transfer of Stock. If Tenant is a corporation, any dissolution, liquidation, merger, consolidation or other reorganization of such corporation, or any transfer of a controlling percentage of the corporate stock of Tenant (whether in a single transaction or cumulatively), shall constitute an assignment of this Lease. If Tenant is a partnership, the transfer of any general partner’s interest (or that of any partner of Tenant which owns more than 50% of the interests in such partnership) shall constitute an assignment. This subsection (b) shall not apply to transfers of shares at any public stock exchange or transfers of shares or partnership interests by reason of the death to members of the family of the shareholder or partner.</p>
          <p id="s1p202">(c) Assignee Obligations. Any assignee or sublessee shall assume all obligations of Tenant under this Lease and shall be jointly and severally liable with Tenant for the payment of Rent and performance of all terms, covenants and conditions under this Lease. In connection with any sublease or assignment, Tenant shall provide Landlord with copies of all assignments, subleases and assumption instruments, at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed assignment or sublease.</p>

When applying to Landlord for its consent pursuant to Section 17(a) hereof, Tenant shall give written notice to Landlord identifying the intended assignee or sublessee by name and address and specifying the terms of the intended assignment or sublease and such additional information as Landlord may request. For a period of thirty (30) days after such notice is given, Landlord shall have the right by written notice to Tenant (i) if Tenant has notified Landlord that Tenant intends to assign this Lease, to terminate this Lease as of a date specified in such notice, which date shall not be less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the date such notice is given; or (ii) except for an assignment under Section 17(b) above, if Tenant has notified Landlord that</p>

If Landlord so terminates this Lease, Landlord may, if it elects, enter into a new lease covering the Demised Premises or a portion thereof with the intended assignee or sublessee on such terms as Landlord and such person may agree, or enter into a new lease covering the Demised Premises with any other person; in such event, Tenant shall not be entitled to any portion of the profit, if any, which Landlord may realize on account of such termination and reletting. From and after the date of such termination of this Lease, Tenant shall have no further obligation to Landlord hereunder with respect to the Demised Premises or the portion thereof as to which this Lease was terminated, except for matters occurring or obligations arising hereunder prior to the date of such termination.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">(e) If the space is not subleased or assigned within ninety (90) days from the expiration of Landlord’s option as set forth above, or any subsequent option as provided in this subsection 17(e), Tenant, shall, prior to entering into a sublease or an assignment of said space, once again give Landlord reasonable written notice and Landlord shall have twenty (20) days after the receipt thereof of reacquiring that portion of the Premises and terminating this Lease with respect thereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p207">(f) Any sums or other economic consideration received by Tenant as a result of any subletting or assignment whether denominated rentals under the sublease or otherwise, which exceed, in the aggregate, the total sums which Tenant is obligated to pay Landlord under this Lease (pro-rated to reflect obligations allocable to that portion of the premises subject to such sublease or assignment) shall be payable to Landlord as Additional Rent under this Lease without affecting or reducing any other obligation of Tenant hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p208">(g) Any sublease or assignment instrument shall be expressly subject and subordinate to this Lease, shall require that any subtenant or assignee comply with and abide by all of the terms of this Lease (including, but not limited to, the prohibitions of this subsection 17), and shall provide that any termination of this Lease shall extinguish the sublease or assignment instrument as well.</p>
          <p id="s1p209">(h) No subtenant or assignee shall have been a tenant, subtenant, or other occupant of the Building or any other building in the complex known as Tower Bridge.</p>
          <p id="s1p210">(i) Tenant shall have no right to sublease or assign if, at the time of the subleases or assignment or request therefor, Tenant shall then be in default under this Lease, nor may Tenant have committed two (2) defaults hereunder during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding any request for a subletting or assignment, whether cured or not.</p>
          <p id="s1p211">(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no subtenant, assignee, or other transferee shall have any rights with respect to any renewal or expansion privilege or option granted hereunder or under any other agreement to the Tenant. With respect to any subtenant, assignee, or other transferee, unless Landlord shall otherwise agree in writing, which agreement may be granted or withheld in Landlord’s sole discretion, this Lease shall terminate effective with the expiration date of the Term which was in effect when such assignment or sublease occurred.</p>

Any such consent by Landlord shall be upon the condition that Tenant will remove the same at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and Tenant shall repair any damage to the Demised Premises or the Building caused thereby.</p>
          <p id="s1p215">19. LIENS. Tenant shall keep the Demised Premises and the Building free from any liens arising out of any work performed, materials ordered or obligations incurred by or on behalf of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p216">20. CONDEMNATION.</p>
          <p id="s1p217">(a) Entire Taking. If all of the Demised Premises or so much thereof as renders the remainder unusable, or all of the Building or such portions of the Building as may be required for reasonable access to or the reasonable use of the Demised Premises are taken by eminent domain, this Lease shall automatically terminate as of the date title vests in the condemning authority and all Rents, Additional Rents and other payments to be made by Tenant shall be paid to that date.</p>
          <p id="s1p218">(b) Partial Taking. In case of a taking of a part of the Demised Premises which does not render the remainder unusable by Tenant, or a portion of the Building not required for reasonable access to or use of the Demised Premises, and, in either case in Tenant’s sole opinion, Tenant is able to continue its business operations in substantially the same manner and space, then this Lease shall continue in full force and effect and the Rent shall be reduced based on the proportion by which the floor area of the Demised Premises is reduced, such Rent reduction to be effective as of the date title to such portion vests in the condemning authority.</p>
          <p id="s1p219">(c) Termination by Landlord. In the event that title to a part of the Building other than the Demised Premises shall be so condemned or taken and if, in the opinion of Landlord, the Building should be restored in such a way as to alter the Demised Premises materially, Landlord may terminate this Lease and the term and estate hereby granted by notifying Tenant of such termination within sixty (60) days following the date of vesting of title, and this Lease and the term and estate hereby granted shall expire on the date specified in the notice of termination, not less than sixty (60) days after the giving of such notice, as fully and completely as if such date were the date hereinbefore set for the expiration of the term of this Lease, and the Rent hereunder shall be apportioned as of such date.</p>
          <p id="s1p220">(d) Awards and Damages. Landlord reserves all rights to damages to the Demised Premises for any partial or entire taking by eminent domain, and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord any right Tenant may have to such damages or award, and Tenant shall make no claim against Landlord or the condemning authority for damages for termination of the leasehold interest or interference with Tenant’s business. Tenant shall have the right, however, to claim and recover from the condemning authority compensation for any loss to which Tenant may be put for Tenant’s moving expenses, business interruption or taking of Tenant’s Personal Property (not including Tenant’s leasehold interest) or improvements or fixtures installed at Tenant’s expense provided that such damages may be claimed only if they are awarded separately in the eminent domain proceedings and not out of or as part of the damages recoverable by Landlord.</p>

The terms “taken by eminent domain”, “condemnation”, “taken” and the like in this Section 21 shall include any agreement of conveyance in lieu or anticipation of the exercise of the power of eminent domain by or between Landlord and any authority authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain.</p>

          <p id="s1p224">(a) Events of Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events (“Event of Default”) shall constitute a breach of this Lease by Tenant:</p>
          <p id="s1p225">(i) if Tenant shall fail to pay any Base Rent, Additional Rent, or any other sum or charge payable by Tenant hereunder when due and such failure shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after notice to Tenant given by or on behalf of Landlord, provided, however, Landlord need not give any such notice, and Tenant shall not be entitled to any such period of grace, more than twice in any twelve (12) month period;</p>
          <p id="s1p226">(ii) if Tenant assigns or hypothecates this Lease or any interest herein, or sublets the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, or if Tenant attempts to do any of the foregoing, in contravention of the terms, covenants, provisions and conditions of this Lease; or</p>

          <p id="s1p234">(ii) distrain, collect or bring action for such Base Rent and Additional Rent as being rent in arrears, or may enter judgment therefor by confession as herein elsewhere provided for in case of rent in arrears, or may file a Proof of Claim in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding for such Base Rent and Additional Rent, or institute any other proceedings, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, to enforce payment thereof, and/or</p>
          <p id="s1p235">15</p>
          <p id="s1p236">(iii) terminate the Demised Term by giving written notice thereof to Tenant and, upon the giving of such notice, the Demised Term and the estate hereby granted shall expire and terminate with the same force and effect as though the date of such notice was the date hereinbefore fixed for the expiration of the Demised Term, and all rights of Tenant hereunder shall expire and terminate, but Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided, and/or</p>
          <p id="s1p237">(iv) exercise any other rights and remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity.</p>
          <p id="s1p238">(c) Cumulative Remedies. All rights and remedies of Landlord and Tenant herein enumerated shall be cumulative, and none shall exclude any other right or remedy allowed by law or equity. In addition to the other remedies in this Lease provided, Landlord shall be entitled to the restraint by injunction of the violation or attempted violation of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p239">(d) Landlord’s Reentry. Upon an uncured default of this Lease by Tenant, Landlord, besides other rights or remedies it may have, at its option, may enter the Demised Premises or any part thereof, either with or without process of law, and expel, remove or put out Tenant or any other persons who may be thereon, together with all personal property found therein; and Landlord may terminate this Lease, or it may from time to time, without terminating this Lease and as agent of Tenant, relet the Demised Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms (which may be for a term less than or extending beyond the Demised Term) and at such Rent or Rents and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion may deem advisable, with the right to repair, renovate, remodel, redecorate, alter and change the Demised Premises, Tenant remaining liable for any deficiency computed as hereinafter set forth. In the case of any default, re-entry, and/or dispossession by summary proceedings or otherwise, all Base Rent and Additional Rent and all other amounts constituting Rent shall become due thereupon and be paid up to the time of such re-entry or dispossession, together with such expenses as Landlord may incur for legal expenses, attorneys fees, brokerage and/or putting the Demised Premises in good order or preparing the same for re-rental.</p>
          <p id="s1p240">(e) Re-Letting the Demised Premises. At the option of Landlord, rents received by Landlord from such re-letting shall be applied: first, to the payment of any indebtedness from Tenant to Landlord other than Rent due hereunder; second, to the payment of any costs and expenses of such re-letting and including, but not limited to, attorneys fees, advertising fees and brokerage fees, and to the payment of any repairs, renovations, remodeling, redecoration, alterations and changes in the Demised Premises; third, to the payment of Rent due and to become due hereunder, and, if after so applying said rents there is any deficiency in the Rent to be paid by Tenant under this Lease, Tenant shall pay any deficiency to Landlord monthly on the first day of each month herein and any payment made or suit brought to collect the amount of the deficiency for any month shall not prejudice in any way the right of Landlord to collect the deficiency for any subsequent month. The failure or refusal of Landlord to re-let the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof shall not release or affect Tenant’s liability hereunder, nor shall Landlord be liable for failure to re-let, or in the event of re-letting, for failure to collect the rent thereof, and in no event shall Tenant be entitled to receive any excess of net rents collected over sums payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder. No such re-entry or taking possession of the Demised Premises shall be construed as an election on Landlord’s part to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such intention be given to Tenant. Notwithstanding any such re-letting without termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for such previous breach and default. Should Landlord at any time terminate this Lease by reason of any default, in addition to any other remedy it may have, it may recover from Tenant an amount equal to the excess of the Base Rent,</p>
          <p id="s1p241">16</p>
          <p id="s1p242">Additional Rent and all other amounts constituting Rent reserved in this Lease for the balance of the Demised Term, as it may have been extended, discounted to present worth at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum, over the then Market Rent for the Demised Premises for the same period, discounted at a like rate, plus all court costs and attorneys fees incurred by Landlord in the collection of same.</p>
          <p id="s1p243">(f) Waiver of Redemption Rights. Tenant, for itself and on behalf of any and all persons claiming through or under it, including creditors of all kinds, does hereby waive and surrender all right and privilege which they or any of them might have under or by reason of any present or future law, to redeem the Demised Premises or to have a continuance of this Lease for the Demised Term, as it may have been extended, after having been dispossessed or ejected therefrom by process of law or under the terms of this Lease or after the termination of this Lease as herein provided.</p>
          <p id="s1p244">(g) Bankruptcy. Neither this Lease nor any rights or privileges hereunder shall be an asset of Tenant in any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization proceeding. If Landlord shall not be permitted to terminate this Lease because of the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, Tenant or any trustee for it shall, within fifteen (15) days upon request by Landlord to the Bankruptcy Court, assume or reject this Lease, and in no event may Tenant or such trustee assume this Lease unless all defaults hereunder shall have been cured, Landlord shall have been compensated for any monetary loss resulting from such default, and Landlord shall be provided with reasonably adequate assurance of full and timely performance of all provisions, terms, and conditions of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed.</p>
          <p id="s1p245">(h) EJECTMENT AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT.</p>
          <p id="s1p246">(i) IF ANY RENT, WHETHER BASE RENT, ADDITIONAL RENT, OR OTHER AMOUNTS CONSTITUTING RENT REMAIN UNPAID, TENANT HEREBY AUTHORIZES AND EMPOWERS ANY PROTHONOTARY OR ATTORNEY OF MONGOMERY COUNTY TO APPEAR FOR TENANT IN ANY AND ALL ACTIONS WHICH MAY BE BROUGHT BY LANDLORD TO RECOVER SUCH RENT, AND IN SUCH ACTION OR ACTIONS, TO CONFESS JUDGMENT AGAINST TENANT FOR ALL OR ANY PART OF THE RENT THEN DUE AND PAYABLE, INCLUDING, IF LANDLORD SO ELECTS, ALL RENT FOR THE ENTIRE UNEXPIRED BALANCE OF THE DEMISED TERM, AND LANDLORD’S COSTS AND EXPENSES WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION OR ACTIONS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES. SUCH AUTHORITY SHALL NOT BE EXHAUSTED BY ONE EXERCISE THEREOF, BUT JUDGMENT MAY BE CONFESSED AS AFORESAID FROM TIME TO TIME AS OFTEN AS ANY RENT SHALL BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE OR BE IN ARREARS, AND SUCH POWERS MAY BE EXERCISED DURING AND/OR AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE DEMISED TERM HEREOF, AND ANY RENEWAL OR EXTENSION OF THIS LEASE.</p>

          <p id="s1p250">(iii) In any action of ejectment or for Rent in arrears, Landlord shall first cause to be filed in such action an affidavit made by it or someone acting for it setting forth the facts necessary to authorize the entry of judgment, and if a true copy of this Lease (and of the truth thereof such affidavit shall be sufficient evidence) be filed in such action, it shall not be necessary to file the original as a warrant of attorney, any rule of Court, custom or practice to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
          <p id="s1p251">TENANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS LEASE CONTAINS PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH LANDLORD MAY ENTER JUDGMENT BY CONFESSION AGAINST TENANT. BEING FULLY AWARE OF TENANT’S RIGHTS TO PRIOR NOTICE AND A HEARING ON THE VALIDITY OF ANY JUDGMENT OR OTHER CLAIMS THAT MAY BE ASSERTED AGAINST HIM/HER BY LANDLORD HEREUNDER BEFORE JUDGMENT IS ENTERED, TENANT HEREBY FREELY, KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVES THESE RIGHTS AND EXPRESSLY AGREES AND CONSENTS TO LANDLORD’S ENTERING JUDGMENT AGAINST TENANT BY CONFESSION PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THIS LEASE.</p>
          <p id="s1p252">TENANT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS LEASE CONTAINS PROVISION UNDER WHICH LANDLORD MAY, AFTER ENTRY OF JUDGMENT AND WITHOUT EITHER NOTICE OR A HEARING, FORECLOSE UPON, ATTACH, LEVY OR OTHERWISE SEIZE REAL PROPERTY OF THE TENANT IN FULL OR PARTIAL PAYMENT OR OTHER SATISFACTION OF THE JUDGMENT. BEING FULLY AWARE OF TENANT’S RIGHTS AFTER JUDGMENT IS ENTERED (INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MOVE OR PETITION TO OPEN OR STRIKE THE JUDGMENT), THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY FREELY, KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WAIVES THESE RIGHTS AND EXPRESSLY AGREE AND CONSENTS TO LANDLORD’S TAKING SUCH ACTIONS AS MAY BE PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AFTER PRIOR NOTICE TO TENANT.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">(iv) The right to enter judgment against Tenant and to enforce all of the other provisions of this Lease hereinabove provided for may be exercised by any assignee of Landlord’s right, title and interest in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p254">(i) Expenses of Enforcement. Tenant shall pay upon demand all of Landlord’s reasonable costs, charges and expenses, including the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel, agents and others retained by Landlord, incurred in enforcing Tenant’s obligations hereunder or incurred by Landlord in any litigation in which Tenant causes Landlord, without Landlord’s fault, to become involved or concerned, together with interest at the Overdue Interest Rate (as defined herein) from the date incurred by Landlord to the date of payment by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p255">22. LANDLORD’S RIGHT TO CURE DEFAULTS. If Tenant shall fail to pay any sum of money, other than Base Rent and Additional Rent required to be paid by it hereunder, or shall fail to perform any other act on its part to be performed hereunder, and such failure shall continue for thirty (30) days after notice thereof by Landlord, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated so to do, and without waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligations of Tenant, make any such payment or perform any such other act on Tenant’s part to be made or performed as provided in this Lease. Landlord shall have (in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord) the same rights and remedies in the event of the non-payment of sums due under this Section as in the case of default by Tenant in the payment of Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p256">18</p>
          <p id="s1p257">23. SUBORDINATION, ATTORNMENT. This Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder are and shall remain subject and subordinate to all the ground, air rights, or underlying leases now or hereafter in effect and to all mortgages and deeds of trust and any amount or amounts which may now or hereafter affect such leases and/or the Building and/or the real property on which such Building is situated, and to any and all advances to be made under such mortgages or deeds of trust, and to interest thereon, and all renewals, replacements or extensions thereof, or on or against Landlord’s interest or estate therein. The foregoing provisions of this Section shall be self-operative and no further instrument or subordination shall be required. In confirmation thereof, Tenant shall execute and deliver promptly any certificate or other instrument which Landlord or any lessor under any ground, air rights, or underlying lease or any holder of such mortgage or deed of trust may request and supply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the termination of such ground, air rights, or underlying leases or the foreclosure of any such mortgage or deed of trust or of any other action or proceeding for the enforcement thereof, or of any sale thereunder, this Lease will not be terminated nor will the rights and powers of Tenant hereunder be disturbed if Tenant shall not then be in default in the payment of Rent or in the performance of any other obligation on the part of Tenant to be performed hereunder, and Tenant shall attorn to any person or persons purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Demised Premises or the Building or the real property on which the Building is situated.</p>
          <p id="s1p258">24. QUIET ENJOYMENT. Landlord covenants that upon Tenant paying the Base Rent, Additional Rent, and all other amounts constituting Rent and performing all of the terms, covenants and conditions on Tenant’s part to be performed, Tenant may peaceably and quietly enjoy the Demised Premises during the Demised Term, subject to all the provisions of this Lease and to all ground, air rights, and underlying leases and to all mortgages and deeds of trust referred to in Section 23.</p>
          <p id="s1p259">25. FINANCING CONDITION. Landlord intends to obtain secured financing for the Building from time to time. If any mortgage lender should require, as a condition to such financing execution by Tenant of an agreement requiring Tenant to send such lender written notice of any default by Landlord under this Lease, giving such lender the right to cure such default until a reasonable period after such lender has completed foreclosure and preventing Tenant from terminating this Lease unless such default remains uncured beyond a reasonable period after foreclosure has been completed, then Tenant agrees to execute and deliver such agreement. If Tenant shall fail or refuse to execute any such agreement within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, Landlord at its option, shall have the right, by giving written notice to Tenant, to terminate this Lease and, upon giving such notice, Landlord shall refund to Tenant any unearned Rent and/or security deposit, this Lease shall terminate with the same force and effect as if the date set in said notice were the Expiration Date herein set forth, and both Landlord and Tenant shall be released from any and all further liability or obligation to the other.</p>
          <p id="s1p260">26. SURRENDER OF POSSESSION. Upon expiration of the Demised Term, whether by lapse of time or otherwise, Tenant shall promptly and peacefully surrender the Demised Premises to Landlord in as good condition as when received by Tenant from Landlord or as thereafter improved, reasonable use and wear and tear and damage by casualty or other elements excepted.</p>
          <p id="s1p261">27. REMOVAL OF PROPERTY. At the termination of this Lease either by expiration of the Demised Term or other cause, Tenant shall remove all of its movable property and trade fixtures which can be removed without damage to the Demised Premises and shall rough patch any holes and repair any damage to the Demised Premises or Building resulting from such removal.

If Tenant shall not pay the cost of storing any such property after it has been stored for a period of thirty (30) days or more, Landlord may, at its option, sell, or permit to be sold, any or all of such property at public or private sale, in such manner and at such times and places as Landlord in its sole discretion may deem proper, without notice to Tenant, unless notice is required under applicable statutes, and shall apply the proceeds of such sale: first, to the cost and expense of such sale, including reasonable attorneys fees actually incurred; second, to the payment of the costs or charges for storing any such property; third, to the payment of any other sums of money which may then be or thereafter become due Landlord from Tenant under any of the terms hereof; and, fourth, the balance, if any, to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p264">28. NON-WAIVER. Waiver by Landlord of any breach (or any subsequent waiver of any breach) of any term, covenant or condition herein contained shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition, nor shall any forbearance or other practice which may grow up between Landlord and Tenant in the administration of this Lease be construed to waive or to lessen the right of Landlord to insist upon performance by Tenant in strict accordance with this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p265">29. HOLDOVER. If Tenant shall, with the written consent of Landlord, hold over after the expiration of the Demised Term, such tenancy shall be deemed a month-to-month tenancy, which tenancy may be terminated as provided by applicable state law. During such tenancy, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord the Market Rent for the Demised Premises, and to be bound by all of the terms, covenants and conditions herein specified, so far as applicable. If Landlord shall not give written consent to such hold over by Tenant, such tenancy may be terminated as above provided, and until Tenant has vacated the Demised Premises it agrees to pay to Landlord Rent for the first thirty (30) days of such holdover, 125% of the amount of Rent then applicable, prorated on a per diem basis, for each day Tenant shall retain possession of the Premises or any part thereof after expiration of earlier termination of this Lease, together with all damages sustained by Landlord on account thereof and all other payments required to be made by Tenant hereunder. After such thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall pay Landlord in advance, 200% of the amount of Tenant then applicable, prorated on a per diem basis, for each day Tenant shall retain possession of the Premises or any part thereof after expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, together with all damages sustained by Landlord on account thereof and all other payments required by Tenant hereunder. Without limiting any rights and remedies of Landlord resulting by reason of the wrongful holding over by Tenant, or creating any right in Tenant to continue in possession of the Demised Premises, all Tenant’s obligations with respect to the use, occupancy and maintenance of the Demised Premises shall continue during such period of unlawful retention.</p>
          <p id="s1p266">30. NO LIGHT, AIR OR VIEW EASEMENT. Any diminution or shutting off of light, air or view by any structure which may be erected on lands adjacent to the Building shall in no way affect this Lease or impose any liability on Landlord.</p>

All notices under this Lease shall be in writing and sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to Landlord and to Tenant at the addresses provided for at the head of this Lease and to the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust at such place as such holder shall specify to Tenant in writing; or such other addresses as may from time to time be designated by any such party in writing. Notices mailed as aforesaid shall be deemed given on the date of such mailing.</p>
          <p id="s1p268">32. LANDLORD’S LIABILITY. Anything in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, covenants, undertakings and agreements herein made on the part of Landlord are made and intended not as personal covenants, undertakings and agreements or for the purpose of binding Landlord personally or</p>
          <p id="s1p269">20</p>

In the event of any transfer or transfers of Landlord’s interest in the Demised Premises or in the Building, other than a transfer for security purposes only, the transferor shall be automatically relieved of any and all obligations and liabilities on the part of Landlord accruing from and after the date of such transfer and Tenant agrees to attorn to the transferee, as long as the transferee has agreed in writing to assume such liabilities and obligations of Landlord.</p>

Tenant may not assign, transfer, sublease or otherwise alienate the use of the parking facilities without Landlord’s prior written consent. Tenant’s continued right to use the parking facilities is conditioned upon Tenant abiding by all rules and regulations which are prescribed from time to time for the orderly operation and use of the parking facility, Tenant’s cooperation in seeing that Tenant’s employees and visitors also comply with such rules and regulations, and Tenant not being in default under this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p431">1. Multi-Tenant Floors. The dimensions used in calculating the Usable Area for each tenant on a Multi-Tenant Floor are measured from the outside face of the exterior window frame to the tenant side of the common corridor wall and from centerline to centerline of the adjacent Tenant demising walls.</p>
          <p id="s1p432">The multi-tenant add-on factor is determined by the amount of Floor Common and Building Common Areas throughout the Building. The Floor Common Areas consist of toilet and utility rooms, elevator lobbies, fan rooms and the minimum common corridor required by convenience and code to provide two (2) means of egress from tenant areas to exit stairways, as well as to provide access to toilet and utility rooms.</p>
          <p id="s1p433">The Building Common Areas which serve and benefit all tenants are established as follows: fire stairs, elevators, elevator lobby, fire exit corridors, fire command station, main entrance area, plumbing and mechanical shafts, elevator machine room, electric rooms, meter rooms, generator room and mechanical room.</p>
          <p id="s1p434">2. Single Tenant Floors. The Usable Area for a full floor tenant is determined by measuring the area of the entire floor to the outside face of the exterior window frames and subtracting any shaft area, i.e., elevators, stairs, plumbing and mechanical shafts. The Rentable Area of a full floor shall equal the usable area thereof, determined as aforesaid, plus an allocation of the Building Common Areas as set forth above.</p>

          <p id="s1p488">17. Each tenant shall store all its trash and garbage within its premises.

          <p id="s1p491">20. Landlord may waive any one or more of these Rules and Regulations for the benefit of any particular tenant or tenants, but no such waiver by Landlord shall be construed as a waiver or such Rules and Regulations in favor of any other tenant or tenants, or prevent Landlord from thereafter enforcing any such Rules and Regulations against any or all of the tenants of the Building; providing, however, that on the whole these rules and regulations shall be enforced against all tenants in the Building in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>
          <p id="s1p492">21.

Landlord reserves the right to make such other reasonable rules and regulations as in its reasonable judgment may from time to time be needed for the safety, care and cleanliness of the Building and for the preservation of good order therein, not to interfere with the use of Tenant’s office space, provided such rules and regulations are enforced in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>

          <p id="s1p556">Execution081606</p>
          <p id="s1p557">THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE (this “Amendment”) is dated August 28th, 2006 between SIX TOWER BRIDGE ASSOCIATES, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (“Landlord”), and NEUROMED PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Delaware corporation (“Tenant”).</p>
          <p id="s1p558">BACKGROUND</p>
          <p id="s1p559">Landlord and Tenant entered into a Lease dated July 31, 2005 (the “Lease”) for approximately 5,200 rentable square feet (RSF) on the 4th floor (the “Demised Premises”) of Six Tower Bridge, 161 Washington Street, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania (the “Building”), which Lease term commenced September 1, 2005 and expires on August 31, 2006.</p>
          <p id="s1p560">Tenant has requested an extension of the Term of the Lease and Landlord has agreed to extend Tenant’s Lease Term for a period of thirty-nine (39) months, commencing September 1, 2006 and expiring December 31, 2009.</p>
          <p id="s1p561">Landlord and Tenant have agreed that this Lease shall be amended to extend Tenant’s Lease Term upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p562">NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p563">1. Incorporation of Recital; Certain Defined Terms. The Background set forth above is incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement by this reference. Terms capitalized, but not defined, herein shall have the same meaning given to such terms in the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p564">2. Demised Premises. The Demised Premises consist of approximately 5,200 rentable square feet (RSF) on the 4th floor, as shown on the attached Exhibit “A-1”.</p>
          <p id="s1p565">3. Term. The extended Term for the Premises shall commence September 1, 2006 and shall expire on December 31, 2009 (“Extended Term”).</p>
          <p id="s1p566">4. Base Rent. Commencing on September 1, 2006, the Base Rent shall become:</p>
          <p id="s1p567">Term</p>

          <p id="s1p572">Year 3 plus 3 months $25.95 per RSF $11,245.00</p>
          <p id="s1p573">5. Additional Rent. Tenant shall continue to pay Additional Rent as provided in Sections 5 and 6 of the Lease for the Extended Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p574">6. Tenant Finish Work. Tenant shall accept the Demised Premises in their then condition “as is” for the Extended Term, except that Landlord, at its costs, shall provide 1) Touch up painting in the</p>
          <p id="s1p575">- 1 -</p>
          <p id="s1p576">Demised Premises in the same color as per agreed upon plan and 2) clean the existing carpet in the Premises. If any furnishings or other personal property of Tenant must be relocated for the re-painting, Tenant shall coordinate with Landlord and shall be responsible the costs thereto. Any other alterations shall be in accordance with Tenant Construction Documents or materials and installation information provided by Tenant and approved by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p577">7. Second Extended Term. a) Provided no Event of Default under this Lease has occurred and is continuing, Tenant shall have the right and option, exercisable by giving Landlord written notice thereof at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Extended Term, to extend the Demised Term for an additional period of three (3) years (the “Second Extended Term”) and, upon the giving of such notice, this Lease shall automatically be extended for such three (3) year period. The Second Extended Term shall be upon the same covenants, agreements, provisions, terms and conditions as the Extended Term except that the Base Rent for the Second Extended Term shall be at the then market rent of the Premises as determined in Section 7(b) below, except there shall be no further right to extend. In the event that Tenant fails to give such notice to Landlord as herein provided, this Lease shall automatically terminate at the end of the Extended Term and Tenant shall have no further right or option to extend this Lease. Upon the determination of the Base Rent for the Second Extended Term, Landlord and Tenant shall enter into a revision of this Lease by amendment hereof to set forth the amount of Base Rent during the Second Extended Term. Any additions, alterations or redecorations to the Demised Premises during the Second Extended Term shall be made at Tenant’s sole cost and expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p578">(b) As used herein, the term “Market Rent” is agreed to be the amount of rent expressed in U.S. dollars and cents per rentable square foot, which Landlord has established as the base rent to be charged for leases of comparable office space in the Building, or, if no space is available in the Building, at the Building’s then scheduled Base Rent in determining “Market Rent” Landlord shall be obligated to take into account the following factors: i) That Landlord and prospective tenant are typically motivated and the Landlord and prospective tenant are well informed and well advised and each is acting in what it considers its own best interest; ii) that the Premises are being let for immediate occupancy and use “as is” with no additional work by Landlord; and iii) that the Landlord will experience no “down time” by leasing to Tenant and Tenant will incur no relocation or costs of refitting new premises elsewhere for its purposes.</p>
          <p id="s1p579">8. Brokers. Tenant represents to Landlord that it has engaged CB Richard Ellis (“Broker”) as its broker in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Amendment. Landlord shall pay any commissions owing to Broker with respect to the Extended Term pursuant to a separate agreement between Landlord and Broker. Tenant and Landlord each represents to the other that it has not dealt with any broker or agent, other than Broker, in connection with this Amendment and the transaction contemplated hereby.</p>
          <p id="s1p580">9. Parking. During the Extended Term, Tenant shall have the parking rights as set forth in the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p581">10. Other Terms and Conditions. All of the other terms and conditions of the Lease not inconsistent with the provisions of this Amendment shall apply for the Extended Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p582">11. Lease Ratified. Except as amended hereby or inconsistent with the provisions hereof, the Lease is hereby ratified and confirmed.</p>
