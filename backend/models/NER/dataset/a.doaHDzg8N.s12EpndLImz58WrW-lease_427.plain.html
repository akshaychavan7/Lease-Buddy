Landlord hereby represents and warrants that, as of the Effective Date, the base Building systems serving the Demised Premises are in good working order.</p>
          <p id="s1p46">2. Term. This Lease shall continue in force during the Term. Should the Lease Commencement Date fall on a date other than the first day of a month, Tenant shall occupy the Premises on the “Occupancy Date” and the Lease Commencement Date shall be deemed to be the first day of the following month. Tenant shall occupy the Demised Premises on the terms and conditions contained herein, except that the Base Annual Rent for the partial first month of occupancy shall be prorated based on the number of days following the Occupancy Date and preceding the Lease Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p47">3. Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p48">a.Base Rent. Commencing on the Lease Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Base Annual Rent, except there shall be not Annual Base Rent payment due for the first two months of the Least Term. Said Base Annual Rent shall be paid in twelve equal monthly installments on the first (1st) day of each and every month during the Term, with appropriate proration for the first and last months.</p>
          <p id="s1p49">b.Additional Rent-Utilities: Tenant shall be responsible for its Proportionate Share of Building electric, gas, water/sewer-storm water runoff consumption and waste removal services. The amount of Tenant’s share shall be prorated such that Tenant shall pay for a percentage of utilities that is equivalent to the portion of the Building that it occupies as adjusted by Landlord’s reasonable estimate of the utilities expense had one hundred (100%) of the Building been furnished said services. The obligation of the Tenant to pay for such costs shall commence as of the Possession Date. If the Landlord is billed for any utility costs subsequent to the Possession Date of this Lease the Tenant agrees to reimburse the Landlord for such costs upon presentation by Landlord of an accounting of the costs incurred.</p>
          <p id="s1p50">c.Other. Tenant shall be responsible for obtaining and paying for all other utilities and services for their space including phone, internet, cable television, and in-suite janitorial services.

          <p id="s1p51">4. Use. The Premises are to be used and occupied by Tenant for the operation of an office and other ancillary uses typically associated with office use and for no other purpose without the prior written consent of Landlord.

          <p id="s1p52">Tenant shall have access to the Premises twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days a week, but the parties acknowledge and agree that the Premises will typically be occupied between the hours of 7am to 7pm Monday through Friday and 8am to 12pm on Saturday (the “ Normal Business Hours”). Should Tenant desire to operate its business for any period of time in excess of Normal Business Hours, on a repetitive, regular or continuous basis (“Extended Hours”), Tenant shall provide written notice to Landlord and the Rent shall be adjusted to reflect a reasonable additional charge for electricity and HVAC for the applicable period, to be mutually agreed on by Landlord and Tenant.</p>

Except with respect to delays caused by Tenant’s neglect, wrongful actions, or wrongful omissions, or Tenant Change Orders or other Tenant caused delays, the Tenant Improvements shall be completed on or prior to January 1, 2017. Within five (5) business days following substantial completion of the Tenant Improvements, Landlord and Tenant shall cooperate to execute a mutually agreeable “punch list” identifying any incomplete and unacceptable items in the Tenant Improvements. No later than thirty (30) days after the parties’ execution of said “punch list”, Landlord shall complete all items identified on said “punch list”.

          <p id="s1p56">b.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Landlord’s failure to deliver the Premises to Tenant on the Lease Commencement Date with the Tenant Improvements substantially completed is substantially the result of Landlord’s neglect, negligence or willful misconduct, in addition to any rights or remedies specifically set forth herein, Tenant shall retain all of its rights and remedies at law and in equity.</p>
          <p id="s1p57">6. Late Charges. Rent is payable on the first day of every month. Any payment received by the Landlord from the Tenant after the fifth (5th) day of the month is subject to a five percent (5%) late charge or amount allowable by pertinent Michigan law, whichever is less.</p>

If the Premises cannot be repaired within one hundred eighty days (180), then Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving notice to Landlord within ten (10) days after the Landlord has notified Tenant of the time required to repair the Premises. Landlord shall, in its sole judgment, reasonably exercised, determine the length of time required to repair the Premises, and shall notify Tenant of such determination within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the fire or other casualty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Premises are so damaged by fire or other casualty that demolition or substantial reconstruction is required, then Landlord may terminate this Lease by giving notice to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the date of such damage. If Landlord commences to restore the Premises in accordance with the terms of this Section 12 and Landlord fails to substantially complete the restoration work which Landlord is obligated to perform hereunder within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the damage, then Tenant shall have the right, during the thirty (30) day period immediately following the expiration of such one hundred eighty (180) day period, to terminate this Lease by delivering a termination notice to Landlord, specifying an effective date, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days after the giving of such termination notice, on which the Term shall expire as fully and completely as if such date were the date originally fixed for the expiration of the Term.</p>

In such a circumstance, Landlord and Tenant shall also each have the right to terminate this Lease for any remaining portion of the Premises upon written notice to the other, which notice shall be delivered within thirty (30) days following the date notice is received of such taking (provided, however, that Landlord shall only have the right to terminate this Lease if it terminates the leases of all office tenants of the Building which are terminable by Landlord in such event). If neither party terminates this Lease, Landlord shall make all necessary repairs to the Premises and the Building and the improvements in which the Premises are located to render and restore it to a complete architectural unit, and Tenant shall continue in possession of the portion of the Premises not taken under the power of eminent domain, under the terms and conditions provided in this Lease, except that the monthly rent shall be reduced in direct proportion to the amount of the Premises so taken. All damages awarded for such taking shall belong to and shall be property of the Landlord, whether such damages be awarded as compensation for diminution in value of the Leasehold or to the fee of the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may go to all legal proceedings and assert any claim that it may have against the condemning authority for compensation for any of Tenant's personal property and trade fixtures and for any relocation expense compensable by statute, and receive such award therefor as may be allowed in the condemnation proceedings, if such award shall be made in addition to and stated separately from the award made for the Land and the Building or the part thereof so taken.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may not elect to intentionally discontinue a utility that is provided by Landlord without Tenant’s prior written consent. However, if for any reason the utilities are shut off for more 30 consecutive days then Tenant may cancel this lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">14. Insurance. Landlord will obtain and maintain, at all times until termination of this Lease and surrender of the Premises to Landlord, special cause of loss form, or its equivalent, property insurance including equipment breakdown coverage, covering the Building and the Premises, including common areas, and all other improvements to the Building made by Landlord but specifically excluding Tenant betterments installed by Tenant and providing the insurance protection to Landlord described in this Lease, which insurance shall be in an amount not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the full replacement cost of the foregoing.
