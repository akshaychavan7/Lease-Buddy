          <p id="s1p102">destroyed by a casualty that is not covered by the insurance required hereunder or, if covered, such insurance proceeds are not released by any mortgagee entitled thereto or are insufficient to rebuild the Building and the Leased Premises; then, in case of a clause (a) casualty, either Landlord or Tenant may, or, in the case of a clause (b) casualty, then Landlord may, upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other party, terminate this Lease with respect to matters thereafter accruing. Tenant waives any right under applicable laws inconsistent with the terms of this paragraph.</p>
          <p id="s1p103">ARTICLE 10 - EMINENT DOMAIN</p>
          <p id="s1p104">If all or any substantial part of the Building or Common Areas shall be acquired by the exercise of eminent domain, Landlord may terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Tenant on or before the date possession thereof is so taken. If all or any part of the Leased Premises shall be acquired by the exercise of eminent domain so that the Leased Premises shall become impractical for Tenant to use for the Permitted Use, Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Landlord as of the date possession thereof is so taken. All damages awarded shall belong to Landlord; provided, however, that Tenant may claim dislocation damages if such amount is not subtracted from Landlord’s award.</p>
          <p id="s1p105">ARTICLE 11 - ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p106">Section 11.01. Assignment and Sublease.</p>
          <p id="s1p107">(a) Tenant shall not assign this Lease or sublet the Leased Premises in whole or in part without Landlord’s prior written consent. In the event of any assignment or subletting, Tenant shall remain primarily liable hereunder, and any renewal, extension, expansion, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or other rights or options granted to Tenant under this Lease shall be rendered void and of no further force or effect. The acceptance of rent from any other person shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any of the provisions of this Lease or to be a consent to the assignment of this Lease or the subletting of the Leased Premises. Any assignment or sublease consented to by Landlord shall not relieve Tenant (or its assignee) from obtaining Landlord’s consent to any subsequent assignment or sublease.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">(b) By way of example and not limitation, Landlord shall be deemed to have reasonably withheld consent to a proposed assignment or sublease if in Landlord’s opinion (i) the Leased Premises are or may be in any way materially and adversely affected so as to reduce the value thereof; (ii) the business reputation of the proposed assignee or subtenant is reasonably unacceptable and will materially and adversely diminish the value of the Building; (iii) the financial worth of the proposed assignee or subtenant is reasonably insufficient to meet the obligations hereunder, or (iv) the prospective assignee or subtenant is a current tenant at the Park or is a bona-fide third-party prospective tenant. Landlord further expressly reserves the right to refuse to give its consent to any subletting if the proposed rent is publicly advertised to be less than the then current rent for similar premises in the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">(c) If Tenant shall make any assignment or sublease, with Landlord’s consent, for a rental in excess of the rent payable under this Lease, following Tenant’s recoupment of its reasonable and actual costs associated therewith (such as commissions, legal fees and build-out</p>
          <p id="s1p110">9</p>
          <p id="s1p111">costs) Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent (50%) of any such excess rental upon receipt. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord $750.00 upon demand by Landlord for reasonable accounting and attorneys’ fees incurred in conjunction with the processing and documentation of any requested assignment, subletting or any other hypothecation of this Lease or Tenant’s interest in and to the Leased Premises as a condition to Landlord processing Tenant’s request.</p>
          <p id="s1p112">Section 11.02. Permitted Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 11.01 above, Tenant shall have the right, without Landlord’s consent, but upon not less than ten (10) days’ prior notice to Landlord, to (a) sublet all or part of the Leased Premises to any related corporation or other entity which controls Tenant, is controlled by Tenant or is under common control with Tenant; (b) assign all or any part of this Lease to any related corporation or other entity which controls Tenant, is controlled by Tenant, or is under common control with Tenant, or to a successor entity into which or with which Tenant is merged or consolidated or which acquires substantially all of Tenant’s assets or property; or (c) effectuate any public offering of Tenant’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange or in the NASDAQ over the counter market, provided that in the event of a transfer pursuant to clause (b), the tangible net worth of Tenant’s successor entity after any such transaction is not less than the tangible net worth of Tenant as of the date hereof and provided further that such successor entity assumes all of the obligations and liabilities of Tenant (any such entity hereinafter referred to as a “Permitted Transferee”). For the purpose of this Article 11 (i) “control” shall mean ownership of not less than fifty percent (50%) of all voting stock or legal and equitable interest in such corporation or entity, and (ii) “tangible net worth” shall mean the excess of the value of tangible assets (i.e. assets excluding those which are intangible such as goodwill, patents and trademarks) over liabilities. Any such transfer shall not relieve Tenant of its obligations under this Lease. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to nor shall permit Tenant to transfer its interest under this Lease as part of a fraud or subterfuge to intentionally avoid its obligations under this Lease (for example, transferring its interest to a shell corporation that subsequently files a bankruptcy), and any such transfer shall constitute a Default hereunder. Any change in control of Tenant resulting from a merger, consolidation, or a transfer of partnership or membership interests, a stock transfer, or any sale of substantially all of the assets of Tenant that do not meet the requirements of this Section 11.02 shall be deemed an assignment or transfer that requires Landlord’s prior written consent pursuant to Section 11.01 above.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">ARTICLE 12 - TRANSFERS BY LANDLORD</p>
          <p id="s1p114">Section 12.01. Sale of the Building. Landlord shall have the right to sell the Building at any time during the Lease Term, subject only to the rights of Tenant hereunder; and such sale shall operate to release Landlord from liability hereunder after the date of such conveyance.</p>
          <p id="s1p115">Section 12.02. Estoppel Certificate. Within ten (10) days following receipt of a written request from Landlord, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord, without cost to Landlord, an estoppel certificate in such form as Landlord may reasonably request certifying (a) that this Lease is in full force and effect and unmodified or stating the nature of any modification, (b) the date to which rent has been paid, (c) that there are not, to Tenant’s knowledge, any uncured Defaults or specifying such Defaults if any are claimed, and (d) any other matters or state of facts reasonably required respecting the Lease. Such estoppel may be relied upon by Landlord and by any purchaser or mortgagee of the Building.</p>

          <p id="s1p117">Section 12.03. Subordination. Landlord shall have the right to subordinate this Lease to any mortgage, deed to secure debt, ground lease, deed of trust or other instrument in the nature thereof, and any amendments or modifications thereto (collectively, a “Mortgage”) presently existing or hereafter encumbering the Building by so declaring in such Mortgage. Within ten (10) days following receipt of a written request from Landlord, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord, without cost, any instrument that Landlord deems reasonably necessary or desirable to confirm the subordination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">ARTICLE 13 - DEFAULT AND REMEDY</p>
          <p id="s1p119">Section 13.01. Default. The occurrence of any of the following shall be a “Default”:</p>
          <p id="s1p120">(a) Tenant fails to pay any Monthly Rental Installments or Additional Rent within five (5) days following Landlord’s written notice to Tenant that same is past-due; provided, however, in no event shall Landlord be required to give the foregoing notice on more than two (2) occasions in any twelve (12) month period.</p>
          <p id="s1p121">(b) Tenant fails to perform or observe any other term, condition, covenant or obligation required under this Lease for a period of fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from Landlord; provided, however, that if the nature of Tenant’s Default is such that more than fifteen (15) days are reasonably required to cure, then Tenant shall have such additional time to cure such Default as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances in question, provided that Tenant commences such curative efforts as soon as is reasonably practical within said initial fifteen (15) day period and thereafter diligently completes the required action within a reasonable time (not to exceed ninety (90) additional days).</p>
          <p id="s1p122">(c) Tenant shall vacate or abandon the Leased Premises, or fail to occupy the Leased Premises or any substantial portion thereof for a period of thirty (30) days, as evidenced by Tenant’s failure to pay Rent or Tenant’s failure to perform its repair and maintenance obligations required herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">(d) Tenant shall assign or sublet all or a portion of the Leased Premises in contravention of the provisions of Article 11 of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">(e) All or substantially all of Tenant’s assets in the Leased Premises or Tenant’s interest in this Lease are attached or levied under execution (and Tenant does not discharge the same within sixty (60) days thereafter); a petition in bankruptcy, insolvency or for reorganization or arrangement is filed by or against Tenant (and Tenant fails to secure a stay or discharge thereof within sixty (60) days thereafter); Tenant is insolvent and unable to pay its debts as they become due; Tenant makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; Tenant takes the benefit of any insolvency action or law; the appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy for Tenant or its assets if such receivership has not been vacated or set aside within thirty (30) days thereafter; or, dissolution or other termination of Tenant’s corporate charter if Tenant is a corporation.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">In addition to the Defaults described above, the parties agree that if Tenant receives written notice of a violation of the performance of the same term or condition of this Lease three (3) or</p>
          <p id="s1p126">11</p>
          <p id="s1p127">more times during any twelve (12) month period, regardless of whether such violations are ultimately cured, then such conduct shall, at Landlord’s option, represent a separate Default.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">Section 13.02. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Default, Landlord shall have the following rights and remedies, in addition to those stated elsewhere in this Lease and those allowed by law or in equity, any one or more of which may be exercised without further notice to Tenant:</p>
          <p id="s1p129">(a) Landlord may re-enter the Leased Premises and cure any Default of Tenant, and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord as Additional Rent for any costs and expenses which Landlord thereby incurs; and Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage which Tenant may sustain by reason of Landlord’s action.</p>
          <p id="s1p130">(b) Without terminating this Lease, Landlord may terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Leased Premises, and thereafter, neither Tenant nor any person claiming under or through Tenant shall be entitled to possession of the Leased Premises, and Tenant shall immediately surrender the Leased Premises to Landlord, and Landlord may re-enter the Leased Premises and dispossess Tenant and any other occupants of the Leased Premises by any lawful means and may remove their effects, without prejudice to any other remedy that Landlord may have. Upon termination of possession, Landlord may (i) re-let all or any part thereof for a term different from that which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Lease Term and for rent and on terms and conditions different from those contained herein, and if a deficiency exists between the Rent payable herein and the rent payable pursuant to the relating, Tenant shall be immediately obligated to pay to Landlord an amount equal to the present value (discounted at the Prime Rate) of the difference between the rent provided for herein and that provided for in any lease covering a subsequent re-letting of the Leased Premises, for the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Lease Term (the “Accelerated Rent Difference”), or (ii) without re-letting, declare to be immediately due and payable the difference between the present value (discounted at the Prime Rate) of all rent which would have been due under this Lease for the balance of the Lease Term to be immediately due and payable as liquidated damages (the “Accelerated Rent”) and the fair market rental value of the Premises for the same period of time (the “Fair Market Rental”), as determined by an appraiser selected by Landlord, based upon recently completed comparable lease transactions in the Building, the Park and the leasing submarket (the Alpharetta submarket) in which Premises is located (such difference being referred to as the “Accelerated Fair Market Difference”). Upon termination of possession, Tenant shall be obligated to pay to Landlord (A) the Accelerated Rent Difference or the Accelerated Fair Market Difference, whichever is applicable, (B) all loss or damage that Landlord may sustain by reason of Tenant’s Default (“Default Damages”), which shall include, without limitation, expenses of preparing the Leased Premises for re-letting, demolition, repairs, tenant finish improvements, brokers’ commissions and attorneys’ fees, and (C) all unpaid Minimum Annual Rent and Additional Rent that accrued prior to the date of termination of possession, plus any interest and late fees due hereunder (the “Prior Obligations”).</p>
          <p id="s1p131">(c) Landlord may terminate this Lease and declare the Accelerated Rent Difference or the Accelerated Fair Market Difference, whichever is applicable, to be immediately due and payable, whereupon Tenant shall be obligated to pay to Landlord (i) the Accelerated Rent Difference or the Accelerated Fair Market Difference, whichever is applicable, (ii) all of</p>
          <p id="s1p132">12</p>
          <p id="s1p133">Landlord’s Default Damages, and (iii) all Prior Obligations. It is expressly agreed and understood that all of Tenant’s liabilities and obligations set forth in this subsection (c) shall survive termination.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">(d) Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that the payment of the Accelerated Rent Difference or the Accelerated Fair Market Difference as set above shall not be deemed a penalty or forfeiture, but merely shall constitute payment of liquidated damages, it being understood that actual damages to Landlord are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain. Neither the filing of a dispossessory proceeding nor an eviction of personalty in the Leased Premises shall be deemed to terminate the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">(e) Landlord may sue for injunctive relief or to recover damages for any loss resulting from the Default.</p>
          <p id="s1p136">Section 13.03. Landlord’s Default and Tenant’s Remedies. Landlord shall be in default if it fails to perform any term, condition, covenant or obligation required under this Lease for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Tenant to Landlord; provided, however, that if the term, condition, covenant or obligation to be performed by Landlord is such that it cannot reasonably be performed within thirty (30) days, such default shall be deemed to have been cured if Landlord commences such performance within said thirty-day period and thereafter diligently undertakes to complete the same. Upon the occurrence of any such default, Tenant may sue for injunctive relief or to recover damages for any loss directly resulting from the breach, but Tenant shall not be entitled to terminate this Lease or withhold, offset or abate any sums due hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p137">Section 13.04. Limitation of Landlord’s Liability. IF LANDLORD SHALL FAIL TO PERFORM ANY TERM, CONDITION, COVENANT OR OBLIGATION REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED BY IT UNDER THIS LEASE AND IF TENANT SHALL, AS A CONSEQUENCE THEREOF, RECOVER A MONEY JUDGMENT AGAINST LANDLORD, TENANT AGREES THAT IT SHALL LOOK SOLELY TO LANDLORD’S RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST IN AND TO THE BUILDING (AND THE RENTS AND PROCEEDS DERIVED THEREFROM), NOR OF ANY OWNER, PARTNER, MEMBER OR MANAGER IN OR OF LANDLORD, FOR THE COLLECTION OF SUCH JUDGMENT; AND TENANT FURTHER AGREES THAT NO OTHER ASSETS OF LANDLORD SHALL BE SUBJECT TO LEVY, EXECUTION OR OTHER PROCESS FOR THE SATISFACTION OF TENANT’S JUDGMENT.</p>
          <p id="s1p138">Section 13.05. Nonwaiver of Defaults. Neither party’s failure or delay in exercising any of its rights or remedies or other provisions of this Lease shall constitute a waiver thereof or affect its right thereafter to exercise or enforce such right or remedy or other provision. No waiver of any default shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other default. Landlord’s receipt of less than the full rent due shall not be construed to be other than a payment on account of rent then due, nor shall any statement on Tenant’s check or any letter accompanying Tenant’s check be deemed an accord and satisfaction. No act or omission by Landlord or its employees or agents during the Lease Term shall be deemed an acceptance of a surrender of the Leased Premises, and no agreement to accept such a surrender shall be valid unless in writing and signed by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p139">13</p>
          <p id="s1p140">Section 13.06. Attorneys’ Fees. If either party defaults in the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or obligations contained in this Lease and the non-defaulting party obtains a judgment against the defaulting party, then the defaulting party agrees to reimburse the non-defaulting party for reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection therewith. In addition, if a monetary Default shall occur and Landlord engages outside counsel to exercise its remedies hereunder, and then Tenant cures such monetary Default, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on demand, all expenses incurred by Landlord as a result thereof, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs and expenses.</p>
