          <p id="s1p63">Premises and Term</p>
          <p id="s1p64">2.1 Premises. Landlord hereby leases and demises to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord, subject to and with the benefit of the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease, the Premises. Tenant shall have, as appurtenant to the Premises, the right to use in common with others entitled thereto the exterior common walkways and driveways on the Lot, and the right of its employees, invitees and visitors to continuously use</p>
          <p id="s1p65">3</p>
          <p id="s1p66">four (4) parking spaces for each 1,000 rentable square feet within the Premises, being (i) one hundred sixty (160) parking spaces in the Building’s common parking areas from and after the Phase I Commencement Date, (ii) a total of four hundred sixty two (462) parking spaces in the Building’s common parking areas from and after the Phase II Commencement Date, and (iii) a total of five hundred forty-six (546) parking spaces in the Building’s common parking areas from and after the Phase III Commencement Date, in each case on a non-exclusive and non-dedicated basis; provided that if Landlord at any time provides another tenant in the Building with parking rights more favorable than those provided to Tenant hereunder, Tenant’s parking rights shall be adjusted such that Tenant has parking rights comparable to such other tenant. Landlord reserves the right from time to time to implement reasonable measures, such as the use of parking stickers, applicable on a uniform basis to all tenants in the Building, in order to monitor the use of the Building’s parking spaces by Tenant and other tenants in the Building, and Tenant shall reasonably cooperate therewith.</p>
          <p id="s1p67">In addition, Tenant shall have the exclusive right to use, at no additional charge, approximately 3,000 square feet of mezzanine space within the Building, as more particularly shown on Exhibit B attached hereto (the “Mezzanine Space”). Said Mezzanine Space is delivered to Tenant in “As Is,” “Where Is” condition, with all faults and without representation, warranty or guaranty of any kind by Landlord to Tenant, except for the performance of that portion of Landlord’s Work to be performed therein. Any costs associated with alterations or improvements to the Mezzanine Space shall be Tenant’s responsibility. Landlord shall have no obligations with respect to the maintenance or repair of the Mezzanine Space, except for the maintenance and repair of its structure. Tenant’s use of the Mezzanine Space shall remain subject to the remaining provisions of this Lease, including those relating to maintenance and repair and payment of utilities.</p>
          <p id="s1p68">Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the any portion of the Premises to Tenant, Tenant may request that Landlord’s architect remeasure the space. If such measurement reveals that the rentable floor area of a portion of the Premises is less than that specified in this Lease, then, effective as of the applicable Commencement Date, the amounts set forth in this Lease for Annual Fixed Rent and any other charges based upon the size of the Premises shall be revised based upon such measurement and the parties hereto shall promptly execute a supplemental instrument evidencing the revised amounts. If Tenant shall have made any payments to Landlord prior to the measurement, then a prompt adjustment shall be made in said payments to reflect the revised amounts. The determination of the measurement shall be computed in accordance with the BOMA standards attached as Exhibit C hereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p69">2.2 Term. TO HAVE AND TO HOLD for a term beginning, in the case of the Phase I Premises on the Phase I Commencement Date, in the case of the Phase II Premises on the Phase II Commencement Date and in the case of the Phase III Premises on the Phase III Commencement Date, and in each case continuing for the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p70">2.3 Extension Options.</p>
          <p id="s1p71">2.3.1 Tenant shall have the option to extend the Term for three (3) additional periods of five (5) years each (each, an “Extension Term”) commencing upon the expiration of</p>
          <p id="s1p72">4</p>
          <p id="s1p73">the then current Term, provided that Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of Tenant’s irrevocable exercise of such option at least one (1) year prior to the then current expiration of the Term, and provided further that at both the time of the giving such notice and at the time of the commencement of the applicable Extension Term: (a) the Lease is in full force and effect, (b) Tenant is not in default, beyond applicable notice and cure periods, in the performance or observance of any of the terms and provisions of this Lease on the part of the Tenant to be performed or observed, and (c) Tenant has not sublet more than fifty percent (50%) of the Premises (other than a Permitted Transfer (defined below)). Prior to the exercise by Tenant of such option, the expression “Term” shall mean the Term as defined in Section 2.2 above, and after the exercise by Tenant of such option, the expression “Term” shall mean the Term as defined in Section 2.2 above as it has been extended by the applicable Extension Term(s). All the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions and agreements in the Lease contained shall be applicable to the Extension Term, except that (i) the Annual Fixed Rent shall be as set forth below, and (ii) no tenant allowance or other concessions shall be paid to Tenant, and (iii) in no event shall Tenant have the right to extend the Term for more than three (3) Extension Terms. If Tenant shall give notice of its exercise of said option to extend in the manner and within the time period provided aforesaid, the Term shall be extended upon the giving of such notice without the requirement of any further action on the part of either Landlord or Tenant. If Tenant shall fail to give timely notice of the exercise of any such option as aforesaid, Tenant shall have no right to extend the Term of this Lease, time being of the essence of the foregoing provisions.</p>
          <p id="s1p74">2.3.2 The Annual Fixed Rent payable during each Extension Term shall be the greater of (a) ninety-five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rent for the Premises, as determined below, as of the commencement of the applicable Extension Term or (b) the Annual Fixed Rent for the last year of the Term immediately preceding the commencement of the applicable Extension Term. If for any reason the Annual Fixed Rent payable during an Extension Term has not been determined as of the commencement of such Extension Term, until the Annual Fixed Rent for such Extension Term is determined Tenant shall pay Annual Fixed Rent at a rate equal to the then-prevailing Annual Fixed Rent. Within ten (10) days after determination of the Annual Fixed Rent Rate in accordance with the provisions hereof, an appropriate adjustment, if any, shall be made between Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p75">For purposes hereof, the “Fair Market Rent” shall mean the fair rent for similar space, free and clear of this Lease, as of the commencement of the applicable Extension Term under market conditions then existing, taking into account all relevant factors and considerations for a market lease transaction, and the then current market rental rates for direct leases of comparable space in comparable buildings in the general vicinity of the Premises to new tenants. Fair Market Rent shall be determined pursuant to the following provisions:</p>
          <p id="s1p76">2.3.3 Landlord shall give Tenant notice of its determination of the Fair Market Rent for the Premises for the applicable period by the later of (i) three hundred (300) days prior to the commencement of the applicable Extension Term, or (ii) sixty (60) days after Tenant notifies Landlord of its election to exercise its extension option. If Tenant disagrees with Landlord’s determination of the Fair Market Rent, Tenant may, by notice given to Landlord within twenty (20) days after Landlord’s notice of the Fair Market Rent is given, either withdraw Tenant’s notice of its election to exercise its extension option, or, elect by such written notice</p>
          <p id="s1p77">5</p>
          <p id="s1p78">(“Tenant’s Rent Notice”) to have the Fair Market Rent determined by the appraisal process (the “Appraisal Process”) set forth in subparagraph 2.3.4 below, which Tenant’s Rent Notice shall include the name of Tenant’s Appraiser (defined in subparagraph 2.3.4 below). The Fair Market Rent determination pursuant to Section 2.3 shall be binding on both Landlord and Tenant. If Tenant does not either give written notice of its withdrawal of its exercise of its extension option or give a Tenant’s Rent Notice within such twenty (20) day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have agreed with Landlord’s determination of the Fair Market Rent for the Extension Term, which determination shall be binding on both Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p79">2.3.4 If Tenant shall timely give a Tenant’s Rent Notice, the following procedures shall apply to such determination:</p>
          <p id="s1p80">(a) Within fourteen (14) days of Tenant’s Rent Notice, Landlord will choose one Appraiser. “Appraiser” shall mean a disinterested real estate professional of recognized competence in the greater Boston area to determine Fair Market Rent who has at least ten (10) years experience in the leasing or appraising of comparable properties within the south suburban Boston commercial market. If the two Appraisers are appointed by the parties as stated in this Section, such Appraisers shall meet promptly and attempt to set the Fair Market Rent. If such Appraisers are unable to agree within thirty (30) days after appointment of the second Appraiser, the two Appraisers shall within ten (10) days after the expiration of such 30-day period, appoint a third Appraiser satisfying the above qualifications. If the two Appraisers cannot agree on a third Appraiser, they shall immediately apply to the President of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board or, if the same refuses to act, to a court of competent jurisdiction, to select a third Appraiser satisfying the above qualifications. The third Appraiser, however selected, shall not have acted previously in any capacity in the prior seven (7) years for either Landlord or Tenant. If either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint an Appraiser within the allotted time, and such failure continues for ten (10) business days after written notice given to the failing party, the single Appraiser who has been appointed shall determine the Fair Market Rent for the Extension Period. Each party shall bear the costs of its own Appraiser and one-half of the cost of the third Appraiser.</p>
          <p id="s1p81">(b) The third Appraiser shall conduct his own investigation of the Fair Market Rent, shall consider relevant information supplied to him by Landlord or Tenant within twenty (20) days of his appointment, and shall be instructed not to advise either party of his determination of the Fair Market Rent except as follows: When the third Appraiser has made his determination, which shall occur no sooner than twenty-one (21) days and no later than thirty (30) days after the selection of the third Appraiser, he shall so advise Landlord and Tenant and shall establish a date, at least five (5) days after the giving of notice by the third Appraiser to Landlord and Tenant, on which he shall disclose at a meeting his determination of the Fair Market Rent. Such meeting shall take place in the third Appraiser’s office unless otherwise agreed by the parties. After having initialed a paper on which his determination of Fair Market Rent is set forth, the third Appraiser shall place his determination of the Fair Market Rent in a sealed envelope. Landlord’s Appraiser and Tenant’s Appraiser shall each set forth their determination of Fair Market Rent on a paper, initial the same and place them in sealed envelopes. Each of the three envelopes shall be marked with the name of the party whose determination is inside the envelope.</p>
          <p id="s1p82">6</p>
          <p id="s1p83">In the presence of the third Appraiser, the determination of the Fair Market Rent by Landlord’s Appraiser and Tenant’s Appraiser shall be opened and examined. If the higher of the two determinations is 105% or less of the amount set forth in the lower determination, the average of the two determinations shall be the Fair Market Rent, the envelope containing the determination of the Fair Market Rent by the third Appraiser shall be destroyed, and the third Appraiser shall be instructed not to disclose his determination. If either party’s envelope is blank, or does not set forth a determination of Fair Market Rent, the determination of the other party shall prevail and be treated as the Fair Market Rent. If the higher of the two determinations is more than 105% of the amount of the lower determination, the envelope containing the third Appraiser’s determination shall be opened. If the value determined by the third Appraiser is the average of the values proposed by Landlord’s Appraiser and Tenant’s Appraiser, the third Appraiser’s determination of Fair Market Rent shall be the Fair Market Rent. If such is not the case, Fair Market Rent shall be the average of (a) the Fair Market Rent proposed by the third Appraiser and (b) the Fair Market Rent proposed by either Landlord’s Appraiser or Tenant’s Appraiser, whichever is closest to the determination of Fair Market Rent by the third Appraiser.</p>
          <p id="s1p84">2.4 Right of First Offer.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">Landlord hereby grants to Tenant a right of first offer (the “First Offer Option”) with respect to the First Offer Space (hereinafter defined), pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.4. For purposes hereof, the “First Offer Space” shall mean all rentable space contiguous to the Premises which becomes vacant during the Term, together with a pro rata portion of the parking spaces then available at the Property (except with respect to reoffered space, as set forth below). Any exercise by Tenant of its First Offer Option shall be subject to Landlord’s determination in its sole discretion as to the final configuration of the First Offer Space being leased by Tenant to insure that any remaining space will be readily marketable.</p>
          <p id="s1p86">If at any time during the Term of this Lease, Landlord intends to market for lease to third parties the First Offer Space or any portion thereof, and if at such time (i) the Lease is in full force and effect, (ii) Tenant is not in Default, and (iii) Tenant has not sublet more than fifty (50%) percent of the Premises (other than a Permitted Transfer (defined below)), then Landlord shall first offer in writing to lease such space to Tenant (the “Offer Notice”) on such terms and conditions (except for rent, which shall be determined as set forth below) as are determined by Landlord in its sole discretion (a “First Offer”). The foregoing covenant shall not prohibit Landlord from marketing First Offer Space at the same time Tenant is considering a First Offer from Landlord, provided that Landlord shall not enter a binding lease of space subject to a First Offer until Tenant rejects or is deemed to have rejected such First Offer. If Tenant rejects the First Offer by notice to Landlord or does not accept such First Offer by written notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days of the date the Offer Notice is given to Tenant (provided that such notice period shall be sixty (60) days if offered at any time when less than three (3) years remain in the Term), the First Offer shall conclusively be deemed to have been rejected by Tenant; thereafter, Landlord shall be free to lease such space to other parties upon such terms</p>
          <p id="s1p87">7</p>
          <p id="s1p88">and conditions as shall be satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion (including the allocation to such space of a number of parking spaces to be determined by Landlord in its sole discretion). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Landlord shall reoffer any space to Tenant which has not been leased by Landlord to a third party within eighteen (18) months after the date Landlord has offered such space to Tenant hereunder, and (b) if a third party has leased a portion of space declined by Tenant hereunder, Landlord shall reoffer the remaining space to Tenant (together with the pro rata portion of parking spaces remaining after such third party leasing) in accordance with this Section 2.4 within thirty (30) days after Landlord has executed a lease with such third party.</p>
          <p id="s1p89">Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Landlord shall have no obligation to make any offer to Tenant under this Section 2.4 if at such time as an offer would otherwise be required to be made hereunder there are 364 or fewer days remaining in the Term, as the same may have been extended at such time.</p>
          <p id="s1p90">The Annual Fixed Rent payable with respect to the First Offer Space shall be the greater of (a) ninety-five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rent for the First Offer Space (determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, and taking into account that no tenant allowance shall be granted hereunder); provided that the parties shall work as expeditiously as possible to comply with the terms of Section 2.3.3, notwithstanding the Fair Market Rent determination timeline set forth therein) or (b) Ten ($10.00) Dollars per square foot of space included in the First Offer Space. If for any reason the Annual Fixed Rent payable with respect to the First Offer Space has not been determined as of the First Offer Space Commencement Date, until the Annual Fixed Rent for such First Offer Space is determined Tenant shall pay Annual Fixed Rent at a rate equal to the then-prevailing Annual Fixed Rent with respect to the remainder of the Premises. Within ten (10) days after determination of the Annual Fixed Rent Rate for such First Offer Space in accordance with the provisions hereof, an appropriate adjustment, if any, shall be made between Landlord and Tenant. Tenant shall have a period of up to three (3) months after the First Offer Space Commencement Date (such date being reasonably determined by Landlord and Tenant) to complete any improvements required by Tenant for its business purposes during which no Annual Fixed Rent or Additional Rent shall be payable with respect to such First Offer Space.</p>
          <p id="s1p91">Upon the addition of any First Offer Space to the Premises, all references to the “Premises” in this Lease shall be deemed to mean and include reference to such First Offer Space and, by way of example, any Extension Option thereafter arising shall apply to the entire Premises so defined, and not to any lesser portion thereof. All of the terms and conditions of this Lease shall thereupon apply to the First Offer Space (except as to the Annual Fixed Rent therefor, which shall be determined as set forth above, and except that the provisions of Article III shall be inapplicable thereto).</p>
          <p id="s1p92">Landlord’s failure to deliver and any delay in delivering the First Offer Space for any reason beyond Landlord’s control shall not give rise to any liability of Landlord hereunder, and shall not affect the full force and validity of this Lease</p>
          <p id="s1p93">Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Tenant may not exercise its rights under this Section 2.4 at any time when there are 364 or fewer days remaining in the Term, as</p>
          <p id="s1p94">8</p>
          <p id="s1p95">the same may have been extended at such time. The Term of this Lease with respect to the First Offer Space shall run co-terminously with the then Term of this Lease, except that if at the First Offer Space Commencement Date there are less than seven (7) years remaining in the Term, the Term of this Lease shall be automatically extended to end the end of such seven-year period as if such date were the date set forth in this Lease for the expiration of this Lease, subject to any rights of extension hereunder, and for such purpose the First Offer Space shall be considered to be part of the Premises demised under this Lease. The Annual Fixed Rent in respect of the Premises under this Lease for the ‘stub period’ (that is, the period from what would have been the end of the Term through the end of the Term as so extended) shall be equal to the greater of (a) 95% of the Fair Market Rent for the Premises as of the date the extended term would have commenced had the Right of First Offer not been exercised hereunder, or (b) the Annual Fixed Rent for the last year of the Term prior to such extension, and such Fair Market Rent shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.3.2 above.</p>
          <p id="s1p96">If Tenant timely exercises its rights under this Section 2.4, Tenant and Landlord shall execute and deliver to each other within 30 days an amendment to this Lease drafted by Landlord based on the terms of this Section 2.4 (a “First Offer Lease Amendment”), provided that it is agreed that Landlord will not be obligated to undertake any Landlord’s Work or provide a tenant allowance therefor, and there will be no extension, expansion or first offer rights. Any and all portions of the First Offer Space for which Tenant validly leases and executes a First Offer Lease Amendment as set forth herein shall be delivered to Tenant in its then “As Is,” “Where Is” condition, with all faults and without representation, warranty or guaranty of any kind by Landlord to Tenant. Time is of the essence with respect to the provisions hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p97">2.5 Right of First Opportunity to Purchase. Subject to the terms of clause (e) below, Landlord shall not during the Term sell or offer to sell the Building and the Lot (collectively, the “Property”) to a third party without first complying with the following (the “First Opportunity Rights”):</p>
          <p id="s1p98">(a) Landlord shall not sell the Property or any part thereof to a third party unless it first gives Tenant written notice of its intention to sell or attempt to sell the Property or such part, and setting forth the terms and conditions upon which it would be willing to sell (a “Sale Offer”) the Property or such part to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p99">(b) Tenant shall have twenty (20) days after delivery of a Sale Offer (the “Offer Period”) within which to accept any such Sale Offer. Failure of Tenant to accept any such Sale Offer in accordance with its terms within such Offer Period shall constitute and be deemed a rejection of such Sale Offer. If Tenant accepts such Sale Offer within such Offer Period, the parties shall consummate the sale upon the terms set forth in such Sale Offer. If Tenant shall fail to consummate the sale within the time period set forth in the Sale Offer, the right granted to Tenant under this Section 2.5 shall thereupon terminate and have no further force or effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p100">(c) If Tenant does not accept such Sale Offer within the Offer Period, then Landlord shall be free, for a period of one (1) year after the expiration of the Offer Period (the “Marketing Period”), to market the Property for sale at a price which is not less than ninety percent (90%) of the purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) offered to</p>
          <p id="s1p101">9</p>
          <p id="s1p102">Tenant in the Sale Offer, and if an offer is received during the Marketing Period, to consummate a sale not later than six (6) months after the expiration of the Marketing Period, without re-offering the Property to Tenant at such reduced price. Upon completion of any sale as provided for under this agreement, Tenant’s rights under this Section 2.5 shall terminate and have no further force or effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p103">(d) In the event Landlord receives an offer acceptable to Landlord during the Marketing Period in which the offer price (the “Reduced Offer”) is less than 90% of the Purchase Price, Landlord shall notify Tenant, by written notice, of the Reduced Offer, whereupon Tenant shall have ten (10) days to accept the Reduced Offer. If Tenant shall fall within such ten (10) day period to accept the Reduced Offer or if Tenant shall accept the Reduced Offer but shall fail to consummate the sale within thirty (30) days of acceptance of the Reduced Offer, Tenant’s rights under this Section 2.5 shall terminate and have no further force or effect. Tenant shall pay for the cost of all transfer taxes payable in connection with a sale to Tenant under this Section 2.5. Tenant’s rights under this Section 2.5 shall be personal to Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., and shall not inure to the benefit of any successor thereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">(e) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, in no event shall Tenant’s rights under this Section 2.5 apply to any transfer of the Property by Landlord to any party directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Landlord, to any portfolio transaction involving the sale of multiple properties including the Property by any party having a direct or indirect interest in Landlord, to any financing transaction involving the sale and leaseback of the Property to a party directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Landlord, or to any transfer of the Property as part of an exchange transaction under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</p>

          <p id="s1p106">Initial Construction Work</p>
          <p id="s1p107">3.1 Construction of Improvements. Landlord shall construct the Premises and all related improvements (collectively, the “Improvements”) in a good and workmanlike manner, in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, and in accordance with final plans and specifications to be agreed upon by the parties pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.1 and, subject to Section 9.7.9 and any “Tenant Delays” (as defined in Section 3.5 below), in accordance with the Construction Timeline attached hereto as Exhibit D. The parties hereby acknowledge and approve the Preliminary Site Plan attached hereto as Exhibit E, the Floor Plan attached hereto as Exhibit F and the Outline Specifications attached hereto as Exhibit G, each of which have been prepared by the Landlord and submitted to the Tenant (collectively, the “Preliminary Plans and Specifications”). Such construction by Landlord is hereinafter referred to as “Landlord’s Work”. Tenant hereby acknowledges that such Preliminary Plans and Specifications accurately reflect the size, quality and character of the Improvements as contemplated by the parties. Landlord shall be responsible for the cost of the Landlord’s Work.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">10</p>
          <p id="s1p109">a. Within sixty (60) days following the execution of this Lease, Landlord shall produce and submit to Tenant a complete set of construction plans and specifications (“Construction Drawings”), including architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical drawings, technical drawings, schedules, diagrams and specifications (which may be submitted separately, provided each are submitted within said 60 day period), all in sufficient detail to allow for the construction of the Improvements in accordance therewith. Such Construction Drawings shall be consistent with the Preliminary Plans and Specifications;</p>
          <p id="s1p110">b. Tenant shall then have ten (10) days following delivery in hand of the Construction Drawings referenced in subparagraph a above in which to approve or disapprove of the same. Any notice of disapproval sent by Tenant shall set forth in detail Tenant’s reasons for disapproving the subject Construction Drawings. If Tenant shall notify Landlord within said ten (10) day period of its disapproval of the Construction Drawings, Landlord shall promptly revise said Construction Drawings in accordance with such comments (to the extent and only to the extent that such comments conform with the Preliminary Plans and Specifications) and shall submit the revised documents to Tenant. Tenant shall then have an additional period of five (5) days following delivery in hand in which to approve or disapprove of the revised Construction Drawings in accordance with the procedure outlined above. If Tenant fails to give notice within the applicable period that it disapproves of the Construction Drawings or any revisions thereto submitted by Landlord, said Construction Drawings shall be deemed to have been approved (provided that the request contains a written reminder that failure to respond within said five (5) day period shall result in the request being deemed approved) . In no event shall Landlord be required to revise the Construction Drawings in connection with any comments of the Tenant which require changes or revisions which are unduly expensive, burdensome or otherwise unreasonable for a building of the type proposed, unless done pursuant to a Change Order (as defined below) which appropriately adjusts the time for performance hereunder and provides for compensation to the Landlord. It is understood and agreed that changes requested by Tenant that are required to conform the Construction Drawings to the Preliminary Plans and Specifications shall not be deemed to be a Change Order hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">Upon Tenant’s approval or deemed approval, such Construction Drawings shall constitute the “Final Plans and Specifications”. Tenant agrees that it will not withhold its approval to any of the plans and specifications submitted pursuant to this Section 3.1 except for just and reasonable cause and will not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner with respect to the approval of the same; and</p>
          <p id="s1p112">c. From and after the approval of the Final Plans and Specifications, upon the request of Landlord to amend the Final Plans and Specifications or the request of Tenant with respect to a Change Order, the other party hereto shall accept or reject such request within five (5) days after delivery in hand thereof, and a failure to respond within said five (5) day period shall be deemed an approval of such a request (provided that the request contains a written reminder that failure to respond within said five (5) day period shall result in the request being deemed approved).</p>
          <p id="s1p113">d. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord and Tenant agree that the scope and details of Landlord’s Work with respect to the Phase III Premises shall constitute</p>

          <p id="s1p115">construction of improvements to accommodate the incremental increase in Tenant’s space program from 2007 to 2008 as described in a document prepared by Tenant entitled “Space Planning for Upland Woods” dated November 9, 2005, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A-4. Tenant shall supply Landlord with such proposed space layout and other information reasonably necessary to enable Landlord to prepare Final Plans and Specifications for the Phase III Premises (“Phase III Space Plan”) by no later than December 1, 2007. Thereafter, Landlord and Tenant shall follow the procedures set forth in this Article III with respect to the improvements of the Phase III Premises, provided that Tenant shall approve the Construction Drawings as the Final Plans and Specifications by no later than March 1, 2007 (so long as Landlord has delivered proposed Construction Drawings to Tenant within sixty (60) days after delivery of the proposed space plan and other required information and has otherwise complied with the schedule for plan approval set forth in this Article III). If the plans are not submitted and approved by the dates set forth above in accordance with the foregoing, Landlord shall improve the Phase III Premises in accordance with the provisions hereof, but the Phase III Commencement Date shall occur on December 1, 2008 regardless of the status of such improvements. In any event, Landlord shall have no obligation to improve the Phase III Premises if Tenant has not supplied the Phase III Space Plan to Landlord by December 1, 2007.</p>
          <p id="s1p116">e. During the period of construction of the Phase II Premises there shall be uninterrupted, reasonable access to the Phase I Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p117">3.2 Substantial Completion. Landlord shall obtain all permits and approvals for the construction of the Improvements, and shall diligently proceed with the construction of the Improvements. “Substantial Completion” of the Improvements shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date on which the Improvements have been completed with the exception of minor punchlist items which can be fully completed without unreasonable interference with the use of the Premises for the Permitted Uses by Tenant (“punchlist items”). For purposes of determining the applicable Commencement Date, such Substantial Completion of the Improvements shall be evidenced by either (i) a certificate of occupancy for the Premises, (ii) a temporary certificate of occupancy allowing Tenant to use the Premises for the Permitted Uses, and subject only to punchlist items or (iii) the issuance of a Certificate of Substantial Completion by Landlord’s architect, together with the issuance by the Town of Norwood Building Inspector of written permission to occupy the applicable Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">Landlord shall notify Tenant of the expected date for Substantial Completion of Landlord’s construction obligations at least fifteen (15) days before such date. Following such notice, Tenant shall have the right to inspect the Premises, together with Landlord’s Representative or other representative of Landlord, for purposes of agreeing upon a “punchlist” of items remaining to be completed. With the exception of items referenced on said punchlist, Tenant shall be deemed to have accepted the condition of the Premises as of the applicable Commencement Date. Landlord shall thereafter promptly commence and diligently pursue to completion the work set forth on the punchlist, to the extent and only to the extent that such work is consistent with the Final Plans and Specifications.</p>
          <p id="s1p119">Landlord shall provide access the Premises on the date indicated on Exhibit D for the purpose of installing Tenant’s furniture, fixtures and equipment, including without limitation,</p>

          <p id="s1p121">the installation of telephone and date wiring and equipment, such access to subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Lease other than the obligation to pay Annual Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other charges, provided that any such work to be performed by Tenant or its contractors during such period shall (i) not materially interfere with Landlord’s construction of the remaining Improvements, and (ii) be coordinated with the remaining Landlord Work in such a manner as to maintain harmonious labor relations and not cause any work stoppage or damage to the Premises or the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Landlord is prevented from substantially completing the Improvements due to a “Tenant Delay”, as defined in Section 3.5 below, the Improvements shall be deemed to be substantially completed for purposes of this Lease on that date on which said Substantial Completion would have occurred but for the applicable Tenant Delay, as reasonably determined by Landlord’s architect.</p>
          <p id="s1p123">3.3 Change Orders. Tenant may request reasonable changes to the Final Plans and Specifications from time to time by written notice to Landlord of the requested changes in sufficient detail to enable Landlord to process and implement such changes (“Change Orders”), provided that Tenant may not by change order, materially alter the basic size, shape, structure, or site layout of the Premises. Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold approval of Tenant’s Change Orders, but Landlord may reject any proposed change order which would increase construction costs for the Improvements, unless Tenant agrees in writing to pay for the increased costs. Tenant shall in any event pay Landlord for any and all increased costs resulting from any Change Order, including without limitation any architectural fees and construction cost increases (plus a fifteen percent (15%) charge for Landlord’s contractor’s overhead and profit), and the costs incurred by Landlord in reviewing and processing the Change Order. Tenant shall receive a credit for Landlord’s actual savings from any deductive Change Order. Tenant shall pay such costs to Landlord not later than ten (10) days after written notice from Landlord of the amount due, provided that in the case of smaller items Landlord may elect to bill only after substantial completion of the item. In the case of larger items, Landlord may elect to bill in increments from time to time as the work progresses for the portion of the item then completed. Any requests by Tenant for changes in the Final Plans and Specifications shall constitute an agreement by Tenant to any delay in completion of the Improvements caused by reviewing, processing, and implementing such changes, and any such delay shall be deemed to be a Tenant Delay. The term “Final Plans and Specifications” as used herein shall, as the context requires, include any and all approved Change Orders.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">3.4 Representatives. Each party authorizes the other to rely in connection with their respective rights and obligations under this Article III upon approval and other actions on the party’s behalf by Landlord’s Representative in the case of Landlord or Tenant’s Representative in the case of Tenant or by any person designated in substitution or addition by notice to the party relying. “Landlord’s Representative” shall mean either Jeffrey DeMarco or the project manager designated by Landlord. Tenant’s Representative shall mean Peter McNeil.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">3.5 Tenant Delays. For purposes of this Lease, any act, omission or delay by Tenant, or its contractors, employees, agents or representatives which delays Landlord’s construction of the Improvements or otherwise prevents Landlord from performing its obligations hereunder</p>
          <p id="s1p126">13</p>
          <p id="s1p127">shall be deemed to be a “Tenant Delay.” Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following shall constitute a “Tenant Delay”: (a) Tenant’s failure to timely submit or approve plans hereunder or any other such failure to grant approvals or disapprovals within the time frame established for such actions, or (b) any delays caused by Change Orders submitted by Tenant. Landlord shall advise Tenant as to whether a requested Change Order shall result in a Tenant Delay, and the anticipated length of such Tenant Delay, as soon as reasonably practical in the circumstances. Tenant shall pay to Landlord any and all additional costs incurred by Landlord as a result of a Tenant Delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">3.6 Condition of Premises. Except for the construction of the Improvements described in this Article III the Premises are leased to Tenant in their as-is condition, without representation, warranty or guaranty of any kind.</p>
          <p id="s1p129">Landlord shall in no event be liable to Tenant or any other party, and Tenant’s obligations shall not be reduced hereunder in the event such construction work is not substantially completed by the date set forth on Exhibit D, provided that Landlord continues to use reasonable efforts and due diligence to complete such work.</p>
          <p id="s1p130">Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section 9.7.9 and any Tenant Delays, in the event the Landlord’s Work with respect to the Phase I Premises is not substantially completed prior to July 1, 2006 and Tenant has not occupied all or any option of the Phase I Premises for the conduct of its business, the Phase I Commencement Date shall be delayed until the date on which the Landlord’s Work with respect to the Phase I Premises is Substantially Completed. Additionally, if the Phase I Commencement Date does not occur on or prior to July 15, 2006, Tenant shall receive a credit against its Annual Fixed Rent obligations hereunder in the amount of $1,000 for each day following July 15, 2006 until the Phase I Commencement Date, up to a maximum credit of $25,000.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">Furthermore, subject to Section 9.7.9 and any Tenant Delays, in the event the Landlord’s Work with respect to the Phase II Premises is not Substantially Completed prior to December 1, 2006 and Tenant has not occupied all or any option of the Phase II Premises for the conduct of its business, the Phase II Commencement Date shall be delayed until the date on which the Landlord’s Work with respect to the Phase II Premises is substantially completed. If the Phase II Commencement Date does not occur on or prior to December 16, 2006, Tenant shall receive a credit against its Annual Fixed Rent obligations hereunder in the amount of $1,621.62 for each day following December 16, 2006 until the Phase II Commencement Date, up to a maximum credit of $120,000. Additionally, in the event that the Phase I Commencement Date has not occurred by December 31, 2006, or if the Phase II Commencement Date has not occurred by June 1, 2007 (as the same may be extended by any Tenant Delays), Tenant shall have the right, as its sole legal remedy therefor, to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Landlord exercised within thirty (30) days after the expiration of such period (unless the Commencement Date occurs within such thirty-day period, in which case this Lease shall not terminate), and, upon such notice, this Lease shall terminate, and neither party shall have further recourse hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">3.7 Warranty of Improvements. Landlord agrees to correct any defects due to faulty workmanship or materials in the Improvements, provided that Tenant shall have given written</p>

Tenant shall pay for any increase in property or liability insurance carried by Landlord with respect to the Building arising from any activities conducted by Tenant in the Premises. In the event that extra premium is payable by either party as a result of this provision, the other party shall reimburse the party paying such premium the amount of such extra premium. If at the request of one party, this nonsubrogation provision is waived as to such party, then the obligation of reimbursement by such party shall cease for such period of time as such waiver shall be effective, but nothing contained in this Section 4.2.2.6 shall derogate from or otherwise affect releases elsewhere herein contained of either party for claims.

Each party hereby waives all rights of recovery against the other for loss or injury against which the waiving party is protected by insurance containing said non-subrogation provisions, reserving, however, any rights with respect to any excess of loss or injury over the amount recovered by such insurance. Tenant shall not acquire as insured under any insurance carried on the Premises any right to participate in the adjustment of loss or to receive insurance proceeds for any loss to the Landlord’s interest in the Premises, the Building or the Lot, including the improvements thereto, and agrees upon request promptly to endorse and deliver to Landlord any checks or other instruments in payment of loss in which Tenant is named as payee. Landlord shall not acquire as insured under any insurance carried on Tenant’s personal property any right to participate in the adjustment of loss or to receive insurance proceeds for any loss with respect to coverages under Section 4.2.2.3, and agrees upon request promptly to endorse and deliver to Tenant any checks or other instruments in payment of loss in which Landlord is named as payee.</p>

Landlord reserves the right to install separate metering for any utilities servicing the Premises not so metered, after which Tenant shall be solely responsible for the direct payment thereof. Landlord shall not be liable for any interruption or failure in the supply of any such utilities to the Premises except to the extent that such interruption or failure results from the</p>

Tenant acknowledges that Landlord Services may include charges under the Park Covenants and that some Landlord Services, such as snowplowing and landscaping, may be provided to the entire Park, in which event the cost thereof shall be allocated to the Building on an equitable basis as more particularly described in the Park Covenants. Tenant shall be responsible for Tenant’s Share of the cost of Landlord’s Services for the Building and the Lot, and for Tenant’s Share of the charges allocated to the Lot under the Park Covenants.</p>
          <p id="s1p164">On an annual basis for each calendar year during the Term (or partial calendar year at the beginning and end of the Term), Landlord shall prepare a projected budget for the applicable year in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles.

Landlord shall not adjust such monthly payments more than once per calendar year, except as may be necessitated by unusual variable expenses, such as snow removal costs or unanticipated increases in insurance costs. As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar year ending during the Term and after Lease termination, Landlord shall render a statement (“Landlord’s Statement”) in reasonable detail, which shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, showing for the preceding calendar year or fraction thereof, as the case may be, the total cost of Landlord Services, and any utilities, insurance and taxes payable by Tenant hereunder.

A Landlord representative shall, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, meet with Tenant at Landlord’s principal office or its manager’s office to discuss the Audit Records. If Tenant’s audit discloses a discrepancy which the parties agree (or a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final non-appealable order) involves an overcharge to Tenant, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a credit against the next installment(s) of Additional Rent in the amount of the overpayment by Tenant, and, in the event that the overcharge exceeds 5%, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for its reasonable costs in connection with said audit.</p>
          <p id="s1p170">4.3 Late Payment of Rent.

On thirty (30) days notice, Landlord may require that the LOC be replaced with an LOC issued by a different institution acceptable to it if the creditworthiness of the then issuing bank materially and adversely declines, and failing such replacement, Landlord may draw upon the LOC and hold the proceeds as an “LOC Security Deposit” (hereafter defined). The LOC shall be in form and content as attached hereto as Exhibit H for a term of not less than one (1) year, and at the end of the Term shall have an expiration date not earlier than sixty (60) days after the scheduled expiration date of the Term.

The use, application or retention of the LOC, or any portion thereof, by Landlord shall not prevent Landlord from exercising any other right or remedy provided by this Lease or by law. The parties agree that Landlord shall not first be required to proceed against the LOC and the LOC shall not operate as a limitation on any recovery to which Landlord may otherwise be entitled. Any amount of the LOC which is drawn upon by Landlord, but is not used or applied by Landlord, shall be held by Landlord (and need not be segregated in a separate account) and deemed a security deposit (the “LOC Security Deposit”).

To furnish to Landlord annually within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar year during the Term, Tenant’s most recent audited financial statements (including any notes to them) or, if no such audited statements have been prepared, such other financial statements (and notes to them) as may have been most recently prepared by an independent certified public accountant or, if no such statements have been prepared, current internally prepared financial statements in form reasonably acceptable to Landlord, certified by Tenant’s Chief Financial Officer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be required to deliver to Landlord such financial statements during any period in which the stock of Tenant is listed on a national securities exchange and such statements are publicly available. At any time during which Tenant is not a public company, Landlord shall maintain the confidentiality of financial statements provided by Tenant hereunder, and shall not disclose the same, except to purchasers, investors, lenders, prospective lenders, prospective purchasers, and prospective investors, all of whom shall agree as a condition of such disclosure to be bound by the confidentiality provisions hereof. Tenant agrees that in the event Tenant’s corporate structure is altered through merger, acquisition or the like, such that Tenant becomes a subsidiary of another</p>
          <p id="s1p207">27</p>
          <p id="s1p208">corporate entity, any and all financial statements delivered by Tenant pursuant to this Section will contain financial information pertaining only to Tenant’s operations and not to any such parent (unless the parent is liable for the obligations of Tenant under this Lease). The foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute Landlord’s consent to any Transfer or in any way derogate from the provisions of Section 5.2.1. Tenant represents and warrants that any financial statements provided by it to Landlord were true, correct and complete when provided, and that no material adverse change has occurred since that date which would render them inaccurate or misleading, and each delivery of financial statements hereunder to Landlord shall be deemed a representation and warranty that such statements are true, correct and complete as of the date of delivery to Landlord. Without limitation of any other obligation under this Lease, the parties agree that this Section 5.1.14 shall apply to each person or entity which is liable to Landlord under this Lease, including any guarantor of this Lease pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.2.1(a) below.</p>

          <p id="s1p210">5.2.1 Assignment and Subletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p211">(a) Tenant shall not assign, mortgage, pledge or otherwise transfer this Lease or make any sublease of the Premises, or permit occupancy of any part thereof by anyone other than Tenant (any such act being referred to herein as a “Transfer” and the other party with whom Tenant undertakes such act being referred to herein as a “Transferee”) without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Without limitation of the foregoing, Landlord may refuse consent in its sole discretion (a) to any Transfer to any governmental or quasi-governmental authority or agency, to any entity in connection with use by or affiliation with a foreign government, to an entity for the provision of social or clinical services, to any non-profit entity, and to any existing tenant in the Building or any prospective tenant with whom Landlord has been in active negotiations in the one hundred eighty (180) days prior to Tenant’s first contact with such prospective tenant, (b) to any Transfer which would in Landlord’s good faith opinion impair or harm the reputation or value of the Building, change the character of the Building or interfere or be inconsistent with use and enjoyment of Building by the other tenants or prospective tenants, or (c) to any Transfer in connection with a proposed use other than the Permitted Use. In all other cases, Landlord agrees that it shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to any proposed Transfer of the Premises by Tenant, pending Landlord’s satisfactory review of the information to be supplied by Tenant regarding, among other matters, all material terms of the proposed Transfer, the proposed Transferee’s creditworthiness and prospects, and its intended use of the Premises, and the compatibility of such use with the character of the Building. It shall not be reasonable for Landlord to withhold consent based upon the amount charged by Tenant in connection with a Transfer. Any request by Tenant for such consent shall be in writing and shall include the name of the proposed Transferee, the nature of its business and proposed use of the Premises, complete information as to its financial condition and prospects, and all material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer. Tenant shall supply such additional information about the proposed Transfer</p>

          <p id="s1p213">and Transferee as the Landlord reasonably requests, and Landlord shall provide written notice of its approval or disapproval (which disapproval shall state with specificity the basis therefor) within fifteen (15) business days of Landlord’s receipt of all information required hereunder. If Tenant is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business organization, the following matters shall constitute a Transfer: (i) the transfer of or issuance of ownership interests, whether in one transaction or a series, of a controlling interest in Tenant, or (ii) a reduction of Tenant’s assets to the point that this Lease constitutes a substantial portion of Tenant’s assets.</p>
          <p id="s1p214">Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Tenant may assign its entire interest under this Lease to or sublease all or a portion of the Premises to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Tenant, without the need for Landlord’s consent, provided Tenant is not then in Default hereunder and it provides evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord that the assignee or sublessee is controlling, controlled by or under common control with Tenant, and a complete copy of the relevant assignment or sublease document, but consent is not required only so long as such entity is so controlling, controlled by or under common control with Tenant, and (b) Tenant may assign its entire interest in this lease to a successor to Tenant by purchase, merger, consolidation or reorganization without the consent of Landlord, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied and provided an Assumption Document (hereafter defined) is executed by the assignee and delivered to Landlord: (i) Tenant is not in Default under this Lease, (ii) Tenant’s successor shall own all or substantially all of the assets or the stock of Tenant; (iii) Tenant shall give Landlord written notice at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of the proposed purchase, merger, consolidation, or reorganization (unless such notice is prohibited by applicable law, in which event, Tenant shall give such notice to Landlord within ten (10) days after the closing of such transaction), and (iv) either (x) the Net Worth of the successor entity is at least equal to the Net Worth of Tenant as of the Date of this Lease (which the parties hereby agree is at least $70,000,000.00), or (y) until the successor Tenant entity has a Net Worth of at least $70,000,000.00, or Tenant shall have provided Landlord a guaranty in the form attached hereto as Exhibit J from a person or entity having a Net Worth of at least $70,000,000.00, Tenant shall provide to Landlord in lieu thereof the Additional Security Deposit, as hereinafter defined. The “Additional Security Deposit” shall be in the form of a letter of credit governed by and in compliance with the provisions of Section 4.4 above, except that the amount of the Additional Security Deposit shall initially be in the amount of all Annual Fixed Rent and Additional Rent for the balance of the Term remaining from and after the date of the assignment, and shall be reduced on each anniversary of such assignment by the reduction in such remaining balance, provided that in no event shall the Additional Security Deposit be reduced below $5,000,000.00. Tenant’s notice to Landlord shall include information and documentation showing that each of the above conditions has been satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Tenant are transferred, Tenant shall cause to be delivered to Landlord an instrument of assumption or guaranty in form satisfactory to Landlord pursuant to which the entity (and if it is a subsidiary of one or more entities, it and their respective parent entities) become primarily liable under this Lease. Any transfers permitted under this grammatical paragraph are referred to herein as a “Permitted Transfer.”</p>
          <p id="s1p215">29</p>
          <p id="s1p216">(b) Any Transfer shall specifically make applicable to the Transferee all of the provisions of this Section so that Landlord shall have against the Transferee all rights with respect to any further Transfer which are set forth herein. No Transfer (including without limitation a Permitted Transfer and any Transfer subsequent to a prior Transfer) shall affect the continuing primary liability of Tenant (including without limitation the originally named Tenant and any successor by assignment), which continuing primary liability shall be joint and several with each Transferee. No consent to any Transfer in a specific instance shall operate as a waiver in a subsequent instance. No Transfer shall be binding upon Landlord or its successors, unless Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an instrument reasonably satisfactory to Landlord (an “Assumption Document”) containing a covenant of assumption of all of the obligations of Tenant hereunder by the Transferee running to Landlord and all persons claiming by, through or under Landlord, provided that Landlord shall be under no obligation to recognize any subtenant upon termination of this Lease. The Transferee’s failure to execute such instrument shall not, however, release or discharge Transferee from its liability as a Transferee hereunder. Tenant shall not enter into any Transfer that provides for rental or other payment based on the net income or profits derived from the Premises. With respect to any Transfer other than a Permitted Transfer, Landlord shall be entitled to receive fifty percent (50%) of all consideration, however realized, which is received by Tenant on account of such Transfer in excess of the Annual Fixed Rent and Additional Rent reserved in this Lease applicable to the space being Transferred, after deducting therefrom all reasonable brokerage fees, fit-up expenses, marketing costs and attorneys’ fees directly incurred by Tenant attributable to the Transfer. The provisions of this paragraph (b) apply equally to Permitted Transfers and Transfers for which Landlord’s consent is required, except as aforesaid.</p>

          <p id="s1p218">(1) Right to Cancel. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Section 5.2.1 in connection with any proposed Transfer other than a Permitted Transfer, if the request is to sublet more than fifty (50%) percent of the Premises, Landlord shall have an option to cancel and terminate this Lease by notice to Tenant with respect to such portion of the Premises which is the subject of the proposed sublease. Landlord may exercise said option in writing within forty-five (45) days after Landlord’s receipt from Tenant of a request to so sublet, and such cancellation or termination shall occur as of the date set forth in Landlord’s notice of exercise of such option, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days following the giving of such notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p219">(2) Cancellation. If Landlord exercises Landlord’s option to cancel hereunder, Tenant shall surrender possession of the portion of the Premises which is the subject of the option on the date set forth in such notice in accordance with the provisions of this Lease relating to surrender of the Premises at the expiration of the</p>
          <p id="s1p220">30</p>
          <p id="s1p221">Term. In such event, (i) Annual Fixed Rent after the date of cancellation shall be abated on a pro rata basis, and (ii) Landlord shall have the right to construct a demising wall and perform such other space reconfiguration measures as are necessary between Tenant’s remaining Premises and the premises for which the Lease was cancelled. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord as Additional Rent for the cost to construct such demising wall and perform such other space reconfiguration measures as are necessary within ten (10) days following notice from Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p222">(d) Any agreement by which Tenant agrees to enter into or execute any Transfer at the direction of any other party, or assigns its rights in the income arising from any Transfer to any other party, shall itself constitute a Transfer hereunder.</p>

          <p id="s1p224">(f) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Lease, Tenant shall have no right to assign this Lease or sublet all or any portion of the Premises and any such assignment or sublease shall be void unless on both (i) the date on which Tenant notifies Landlord of its intent to enter into any assignment or sublease and (ii) the date on which such assignment or sublease is to take effect, Tenant is not in Default of any of its obligations under this Lease; provided, however, that Landlord shall retain the right to waive the provisions of this Section 5.2.1.</p>
          <p id="s1p225">(g) The acceptance by the Landlord of the payment of Annual Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or other charges following an assignment, subletting or other Transfer prohibited by this Section 5.2.1 shall not be deemed to be a consent by the Landlord to any such assignment, subletting or other Transfer, nor shall the same constitute a waiver of any right or remedy of the Landlord.</p>

In calculating the rent reserved there shall be included, in addition to the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent, the value or all other considerations agreed to be paid or performed by Tenant for said residue, including the reimbursement by Tenant of the cost of the Landlord’s Work as set forth in Section 3.1 above. Tenant further covenants as additional and cumulative obligations after any such termination to pay punctually to Landlord all the sums and to perform all the obligations which Tenant covenants in this Lease to pay and to perform in the same manner and to the same extent and at the same time as if this Lease had not been terminated. In calculating the amounts to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the next preceding sentence Tenant shall be credited with the portion of any amount paid to Landlord as compensation as in this Section 7.2 provided, allocable to the corresponding portion of the Term and also with the net proceeds of any rent obtained by Landlord by reletting the Premises, after deducting all Landlord’s expenses in connection with such reletting, including, without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, fees for legal services and expenses of preparing the Premises for such reletting, it being agreed by Tenant that Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof, for a term or terms which may at Landlord’s option be equal to or less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term and may grant such concessions and free rent as Landlord in its reasonable judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same, and to (ii) make such alterations, repairs and decorations in the Premises as Landlord in its reasonable</p>

Any and all rights and remedies which Landlord or Tenant may have under this Lease, and at law and equity, shall be cumulative and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other, and any two or more of all such rights and remedies may be exercised at the same time insofar as permitted by law.</p>

          <p id="s1p252">The failure of Landlord or Tenant to seek redress for violation of, or to insist upon the strict performance of, any covenant or condition of this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such violation nor prevent a subsequent act, which would have originally constituted a violation, from having all the force and effect of an original violation. The receipt by Landlord of rent with knowledge of the breach of any covenant of this Lease shall not be deemed to have been a waiver of such breach by Landlord, or by Tenant, unless such waiver be in writing signed by the party to be charged. No consent or waiver, express or implied, by Landlord or Tenant to or of any breach of any agreement or duty shall be construed as a waiver or consent to or of any other breach of the same or any other agreement or duty.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">7.6 No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by Landlord of a lesser sum than the Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other charge then due shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest installment of such rent or charge due, unless Landlord elects by notice to Tenant to credit such sum against the most recent installment due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent or other charge be deemed a waiver, an agreement or an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover the balance of such installment or pursue any other remedy in this Lease provided.</p>

          <p id="s1p256">Mortgage; Park Covenants</p>
          <p id="s1p257">8.1 Rights of Mortgage Holders. The word “mortgage” as used herein includes mortgages, deeds of trust or other similar instruments evidencing other voluntary liens or encumbrances, and modifications, consolidations, extensions, renewals, replacements and substitutes thereof. The word “holder” shall mean a mortgagee, and any subsequent holder or holders of a mortgage. Until the holder of a mortgage shall enter and take possession of the Premises for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall have only such rights of Landlord as are necessary to preserve the integrity of this Lease as security. Upon entry and taking possession of the Premises for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall have all the rights of Landlord. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the contrary, including without limitation Section 9.4, no such holder of a mortgage shall be liable either as mortgagee or as assignee, to perform, or be liable in damages for failure to perform, any of the obligations of Landlord unless and until such holder shall enter and take possession of the Premises for the purpose of foreclosure. Upon entry for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall be liable to perform all of the obligations of Landlord accruing from and after such entry, subject to and with the benefit of the provisions of Section 9.4, provided that a discontinuance of any foreclosure proceeding shall be deemed a conveyance under said provisions to the owner of the Premises. No Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other charge shall be paid more than 30 days prior to the due dates thereof and payments made in violation of this provision shall (except to the extent that such payments are actually received by a mortgagee in possession or in the process of foreclosing its mortgage) be a nullity as against such mortgagee and Tenant shall be liable for the amount of such payments to such mortgagee.</p>
          <p id="s1p258">The covenants and agreements contained in this Lease with respect to the rights, powers and benefits of a holder of a mortgage (including, without limitation, the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 8.1) constitute a continuing offer to any person, corporation or other entity, which by accepting a mortgage subject to this Lease, assumes the obligations herein set forth with respect to such holder; such holder is hereby constituted a party of this Lease as an obligee hereunder to the same extent as though its name were written hereon as such; and such holder shall be entitled to enforce such provisions in its own name. Tenant agrees on request of Landlord to execute and deliver from time to time any commercially reasonable agreement which may be necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 8.1.</p>
          <p id="s1p259">8.2 Lease Subordinate to Mortgages. This Lease is and shall continue to be subject and subordinate to any presently existing and any future mortgage or mortgages secured by the Premises, and to any and all advances hereafter made thereunder, and to the interest of the holder or holders thereof in the Premises, provided that (i) Landlord shall obtain an agreement on the part of any current mortgagee in a commercially customary and reasonable form, to not disturb Tenant’s rights of possession hereunder, conditioned upon Tenant not being in default under any of the terms of this Lease, and (ii) Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to obtain from any future mortgagee on Tenant’s behalf an agreement on the part of such mortgagee in a commercially</p>
          <p id="s1p260">37</p>
          <p id="s1p261">customary and reasonable form, to not disturb Tenant’s rights of possession hereunder, provided that in no event shall any failure of Landlord to obtain such an agreement from a future mortgagee affect the obligations of Tenant hereunder. In any event, the mortgagee, or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale or otherwise, shall not be:</p>
          <p id="s1p262">(a) liable for any act or omission of a prior Landlord (including the mortgagor), except for acts or omissions of a continuing nature only to the extent the same continue after the date that the mortgagee or purchaser at a foreclosure sale takes possession of the Premises; or</p>
          <p id="s1p263">(b) subject to any offset or defenses which the Tenant might have against any prior Landlord (including mortgagor); or</p>
          <p id="s1p264">(c) bound by any rent or additional rent which the Tenant might have paid in advance to any prior Landlord (including the mortgagor), for any period beyond the month in which foreclosure or sale occurs; or</p>
          <p id="s1p265">(d) bound by any security deposit which Tenant may have paid to any prior Landlord (including the mortgagor), unless such deposit is in an escrow fund held by or available to the mortgagee; or</p>
          <p id="s1p266">(e) bound by any agreement or modification of the Lease made without the consent of the mortgagee; or</p>
          <p id="s1p267">(f) bound by any notice of termination given by any prior Landlord (including the mortgagor) without the mortgagee’s written consent thereto; or</p>
          <p id="s1p268">(g) personally liable under this Lease; any mortgagee’s liability under the Lease shall be limited to its ownership interest in the Premises; or</p>
          <p id="s1p269">(h) liable for any fact or circumstance or condition to the extent existing or arising prior to the mortgagee’s (or such purchaser’s) succession to the interest of the Landlord under the Lease, except to the extent that any such fact or circumstance or condition is of a continuing nature, and then only to the extent the same continues after the date that the mortgagee or purchaser takes possession of the Premises, and such mortgagee or such purchaser further shall not be liable except during that period of time, if any, in which such mortgagee or purchaser and Tenant are in privity of estate.</p>
          <p id="s1p270">Notwithstanding the foregoing, any mortgagee may at its election subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease without the consent or approval of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p271">8.3 Park Covenants. This Lease shall be subordinate to that certain Declaration of Covenants, Easements and Restrictions recorded in the Norfolk Registry of Deeds on February 10, 2005 in Book 22094, Page 439, and which Landlord may hereafter amend from time to time without the consent of Tenant, provided such amendment does not materially derogate from any rights of Tenant hereunder.</p>

No owner of the Premises shall be liable under this Lease except for breaches of Landlord’s obligations occurring while owner of the Premises. The obligations of Landlord shall be binding upon the assets of Landlord which comprise the Premises but not upon other assets of Landlord. No individual member, partner, trustee, stockholder, officer, director, employee or beneficiary of Landlord or any member of Landlord shall be personally liable under this Lease and Tenant shall look solely to Landlord’s interest in the Building, the Premises and the Lot in pursuit of its remedies upon an event of default hereunder, and the general assets of Landlord and of the individual members, partners, trustees, stockholders, officers, employees or beneficiaries of Landlord or any member of Landlord shall not be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of the remedies of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p279">9.5 Landlord’s Default. Landlord shall not be deemed to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder unless it shall fail to perform such obligations and such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from Tenant (or such lesser period as may be reasonable in the circumstances in the event of an imminent threat to person or property, without response from Landlord within two (2) business</p>

          <p id="s1p281">days notice thereof), or such additional time as is reasonably required to correct any such default after notice has been given by Tenant to Landlord specifying the nature of Landlord’s alleged default. Neither party shall be liable in any event for incidental or consequential damages to the other party by reason of any default by a party hereunder, whether or not that party is notified that such damages may occur. Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease for any default by Landlord hereunder and no right, for any such default, to offset or counterclaim against any rent due hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p282">9.6 Brokerage.

          <p id="s1p283">9.7 Applicable Law and Construction.</p>
          <p id="s1p284">9.7.1 Applicable Law. This Lease shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which the Premises are located. If any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be declared invalid, or unenforceable by the final ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction having final review, the remaining terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease and their application to persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall continue to be enforced and recognized as valid agreements of the parties, and in the place of such invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be substituted a like, but valid and enforceable provision which comports to the findings of the aforesaid court and most nearly accomplishes the original intention of the parties.</p>

          <p id="s1p290">9.7.6 No Surrender. The delivery of keys to any employee of Landlord or to any manager or any employee or agent thereof shall not operate as a termination of this Lease or a surrender of the Premises. No act by Landlord or Manager or any employee or agent thereof shall be deemed an acceptance of a surrender of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p291">9.7.7 Cumulative Remedies. The specific remedies to which either party may resort under the terms of this Lease are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other remedies or means of redress to which it may be lawfully entitled in case of any breach or threatened breach by a party of any provisions of this Lease.

          <p id="s1p294">9.7.10 Additional Rent. Any sum, charge or expense payable by Tenant hereunder shall constitute Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p295">9.8 Submission Not an Offer. The submission of a draft of this Lease or a summary of some or all of its provisions does not constitute an offer to lease or demise the Premises, it being understood and agreed that neither Landlord nor Tenant shall be legally bound with respect to the leasing of the Premises unless and until this Lease has been executed by both Landlord and Tenant and a fully executed copy delivered.</p>
          <p id="s1p296">9.9 Authority of Tenant.

          <p id="s1p709">(g) Landlord’s consent to any assignment or subletting of the Lease by Tenant, or any subletting of the Premises demised under the Lease by Tenant;</p>

          <p id="s1p711">(i) any rights, powers or privileges Landlord may now or hereafter have against any person, entity or collateral;</p>
          <p id="s1p712">(j) any assignment, conveyance, mortgage, merger or other transfer, voluntary or involuntary (whether by operation of law or otherwise), of all or any part of Tenant’s interest in the Lease or the occurrence of any such assignment, conveyance, mortgage, merger or other voluntary or involuntary transfer which results in Guarantor becoming Tenant under the Lease;</p>
          <p id="s1p713">(k) any assignment, conveyance, mortgage, merger or other transfer, voluntary or involuntary (whether by operation of law or otherwise), of all or part of the interest or rights of Landlord under the Lease; or</p>
          <p id="s1p714">(l) any failure to enforce any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Lease or this Guaranty.</p>
          <p id="s1p715">Schedule I - Page 5</p>
          <p id="s1p716">In the event that any agreement or stipulation between Landlord and Tenant shall extend the time of performance or modify or waive any of the covenants of the Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed, Guarantor shall continue to be liable upon its guarantee according to the tenor of any such agreement or stipulation.</p>
          <p id="s1p717">3. To hold Guarantor liable under this Guarantee no demand shall be required. Landlord shall have the right to enforce this Guarantee without pursuing any rights or remedies of Landlord against Tenant or any other party, or any security Landlord may hold; it being intended that if (i) there shall occur any breach, insolvency or bankruptcy default or any other default by Tenant in the performance or observance of any Covenant in the Lease, (ii) notice of any such default or breach shall have been given by Landlord to Tenant, and (iii) Tenant and Guarantor shall have failed to cure such default or breach within the applicable grace period, if any, then Guarantor shall be obligated to perform its obligations hereunder. Landlord may, at its option but after the expiration of any applicable grace periods under the Lease, proceed against Guarantor, or any one or more guarantors if there be more than one, without having commenced any action, or having obtained any judgment against Tenant or against Guarantor or against any other guarantor if there be more than one; and Guarantor’s and each other guarantor’s liability with regard to the Lease shall be as a primary party, with the same force and effect as if Guarantor and each other guarantor had originally signed the Lease as a tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p718">4. Guarantor hereby expressly waives and releases (i) notice of the acceptance of this Guarantee (any requirement for acceptance of this Guaranty by Landlord is hereby waived) and notice of any change in Tenant’s financial condition; (ii) the right to interpose all substantive and procedural defenses of the law of guarantee, indemnification and suretyship, except the defenses of prior payment or prior performance by Tenant or Guarantor (of the obligations which Guarantor is called upon to pay or perform under this Guarantee); (iii) all rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors, or sureties, including without limitation, any extension of time conferred by any law now or hereafter in effect; (iv) the right to interpose any defense (except as allowed under (ii) above), set off or counterclaim (unless the failure to interpose such counterclaim would constitute a bar to a separate proceeding and a waiver of such claim) of any nature or description in any action or proceeding (provided nothing stated herein shall prevent Guarantor from bringing a separate proceeding of any nature or description), except to the extent Tenant may interpose the same under the Lease, and (v) any right or claim or right to cause a marshalling of Tenant’s assets or to cause Landlord to proceed against Tenant, and/or any collateral held by Landlord at any time or in any particular order.</p>
          <p id="s1p719">5. Without limiting Guarantor’s obligations elsewhere under this Guarantee, Guarantor agrees that if Tenant, or Tenant’s trustee, receiver or other officer with similar powers with respect to Tenant, rejects, disaffirms or otherwise terminates the Lease pursuant to any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or any other law affecting creditors’ rights generally, Guarantor shall automatically be deemed to have assumed, from and after the date such rejection, disaffirmance or other termination of the Lease is deemed effective, all obligations and liabilities of Tenant under the Lease to the same extent as if Guarantor had been originally named instead of Tenant as a party to the</p>
          <p id="s1p720">Schedule I - Page 6</p>
          <p id="s1p721">Lease and the Lease had never been so rejected, disaffirmed or otherwise terminated. Guarantor, upon such assumption, shall be obligated to perform and observe all of the terms, conditions and covenants of the Lease to be observed and performed by Tenant thereunder whether theretofore accrued or thereafter accruing, and Guarantor shall be subject to any rights to remedies of Landlord which may have theretofore accrued or which may thereafter accrue against Tenant on account of any default under the Lease, notwithstanding that such defaults existed prior to the date Guarantor was deemed to have automatically assumed the Lease or that such rights or remedies are unenforceable against Tenant by reason of such rejection, disaffirmance or other termination. Guarantor shall confirm such assumption in writing at the request of Landlord upon or after such rejection, disaffirmance or other termination, but the failure to do so shall not affect such assumption. Guarantor, upon the assumption of the Lease, shall have all the rights of Tenant under the Lease (to the extent permitted by law). Neither Guarantor’s obligation to make payment in accordance with the terms of this Guarantee nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed, stayed, released or limited in any manner whatsoever by any impairment, modification, change, release, limitation or stay of the liability of Tenant or its estate in bankruptcy or any remedy for the enforcement thereof, resulting from the operation of any present or future provision of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or other statute or from the decision of any court interpreting any of the same, and Guarantor shall be obligated under this Guarantee as if no such impairment, stay, modification, change, release or limitation had occurred. The liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected by any disability of Tenant or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Tenant. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor hereby waives all suretyship defenses or defenses in the nature thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p722">6. This Guarantee and all rights, obligations and liabilities arising hereunder shall be construed according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Guarantor hereunder agrees that any legal action, suit, or proceeding against it with respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or arising out of or in connection with this Guarantee or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be brought in the United States Courts for the District of Massachusetts, or in the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as Landlord may elect, and, by execution and delivery of this Guarantee, Guarantor hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the venue and non-exclusive jurisdiction of each of the aforesaid courts in persona, generally and unconditionally with respect to any such action, suit, or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property. Guarantor further agrees that final judgment against it in any action, suit, or proceeding referred to herein shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and of the amount of its indebtedness.</p>
          <p id="s1p723">7. Until all the Covenants in the Lease on Tenant’s part to be performed and observed are fully performed and observed, Guarantor: (a) shall have no right of subrogation against Tenant by reason of any payments or acts of performance by Guarantor, in compliance with the obligations of Guarantor hereunder; and</p>
          <p id="s1p724">Schedule I - Page 7</p>
          <p id="s1p725">(b) subordinates any liability or indebtedness of Tenant now or hereafter held by Guarantor to the obligations of Tenant to Landlord under the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p726">8. Guarantor represents and warrants to Landlord that as of the date hereof:</p>
          <p id="s1p727">(a) Guarantor has full power, authority and legal standing to enter into this Guarantee, and abide by the terms hereof, including, without limitation, the payment of all moneys required herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p728">(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Guarantor of this Guarantee has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action.</p>
          <p id="s1p729">(c) This Guarantee constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable in the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, and other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, to moratorium laws from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.)</p>
          <p id="s1p730">(d) Guarantor is an affiliate of Tenant, and has received full, fair and adequate consideration for the within Guaranty.</p>
          <p id="s1p731">9. If Landlord shall be obligated by reason of any bankruptcy, insolvency or other legal proceeding to pay or repay to Tenant or to any trustee, receiver or other representative of the Tenant, any amounts previously paid by Tenant pursuant to the Lease, Guarantor shall reimburse Landlord for any such payment or repayment and this Guarantee shall extend to the extent of such payment or repayment made by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p732">10. Guarantor shall, at any time and from time to time, within ten (10) days following the request by Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a statement certifying that this Guarantee is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, that the same is in full force and effect as modified and stating such modifications) and that to the best of Guarantor’s knowledge, Guarantor is not in default hereunder (or if there is such a default, describing such default in reasonable detail).</p>
          <p id="s1p733">11. All remedies afforded to Landlord by reason of this Guarantee or the Lease, or otherwise available at law or in equity, are separate and cumulative remedies and it is agreed that no one remedy, whether or not exercised by Landlord, shall be deemed to be in exclusion of any other remedy available to Landlord and shall not limit or prejudice any other legal or equitable remedy which Landlord may have.</p>
          <p id="s1p734">12. Guarantor waives trial by jury of any and all issues arising in any action, suit or proceeding to which Landlord and Guarantor may be parties upon, under or connected with this Guarantee or any of its provisions, directly or indirectly. If there is more than one guarantor of the Lease, Guarantor and such other guarantor(s) shall be jointly and severally liable.</p>
          <p id="s1p735">Schedule I - Page 8</p>
          <p id="s1p736">13. If any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Guarantee or the application thereof to any circumstance or to Guarantor shall be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remaining terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of this Guarantee or the application thereof to any circumstances or to Guarantor, other than those as to which any term, covenant, condition or provision is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby and each remaining term, covenant, condition and provision of this Guarantee shall be valid and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
          <p id="s1p737">14. This Guarantee may be modified only by an instrument in writing signed by duly authorized representatives of Landlord and Guarantor.</p>
          <p id="s1p738">15. Whenever, by the terms of this Guarantee, notice shall or may be given either to Landlord or to Guarantor, such notice shall be in writing and shall be sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid or by so-called “express” mail (such as Federal Express or U.S. Postal Service Express Mail):</p>
          <p id="s1p739">If intended for Landlord, addressed to Landlord at the address first set forth above, with a copy to Common Fund Realty, Inc., 15 Old Danbury Road, P.O. Box 812, Wilton, CT 06897, or to such other address or addresses as may from time to time hereafter be designated by Landlord by like notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p740">If intended for Guarantor, addressed to Guarantor at the address set forth above, or to such other address or addresses as may from time to time hereafter be designated by Guarantor by like notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p741">All such notices shall be effective when deposited in the United States mail within the Continental United States or when received by the “express” mail carrier, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p742">16. This Guarantee shall be binding upon Guarantor and its representatives, successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by the successors, assigns and grantors of Landlord or by any person to whom Landlord’s interest in the Lease or any part thereof, including the rents, may be assigned whether by way of mortgage or otherwise. Wherever in this Guarantee reference is made to either Landlord or Tenant, the same shall be deemed to refer also to the then successor or assign of Landlord and the then permitted successor or assignee of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p743">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Guarantor has executed this Guarantee under seal as of the day and year first above written.</p>
