          <p id="s1p11">having a business address as shown above (“Lessee”).</p>
          <p id="s1p12">WITNESSETH:</p>
          <p id="s1p13">That the State of Utah, as Lessor, in consideration of the rentals, royalties, and other financial consideration paid or required to be paid by Lessee, and the covenants of Lessee set forth below, does hereby GRANT AND LEASE to Lessee the exclusive right and privilege to explore for, drill for, produce, remove, extract, store, utilize, treat, process, convert, and sell, geothermal energy and related “products”, including steam, and hot water (collectively “the leased substances”), covered by this lease and located within the boundaries of the following-described tract of land (the “Leased Premises”) located in BEAVER County, State of Utah:</p>

          <p id="s1p19">Page No. 2</p>
          <p id="s1p20">This Mining Lease and Agreement is subject to, and Lessee hereby agrees to and accepts, the following covenants, terms, and conditions.</p>
          <p id="s1p21">1.LEASED SUBSTANCES.</p>
          <p id="s1p22">1.1The word “products” (collectively “leased substances”) as used herein, means thermal energy in the form of hot water, steam, by-products thereof, steam condensates, as well as or electrical and other energy derived, generated or manufactured from water, steam condensates and other by-products derived or obtained from the geothermal leasehold estate. The phrase “sufficient commercial quantities” as used herein, means that amount and character of products extracted from the subsurface geothermal estate which can be produced from the leasehold sufficient for commercial sale thereof, or which would warrant construction of facilities for processing or sale of such product or of products.</p>
          <p id="s1p23">This mineral lease grants Lessee the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to extract the leased substances. In the event that minerals or materials other than the leased substances are discovered during lease operations, Lessee shall promptly notify the Lessor and shall not further disturb or remove the other minerals or materials without Lessor’s written permission. Upon notifying Lessor of such discovery the Lessee shall have preference in making application to the Lessor for a lease or permit covering the unleased minerals or materials that are discovered. There has not been determined to date by judicial decision whether geothermal steam, hot water and other water not associated with chemicals constituting minerals at depths below the surface where potable water may be developed by drilling, constitutes part of the surface estate sold by the State of Utah with a reservation of minerals to the State. Nor has it been determined by scientific discoveries or analysis to date, whether geothermal steam and hot water at depths where the same may be discovered below the surface of the earth, are unassociated with and independent of chemicals constituting minerals of the mineral estate reserved to the State of Utah. The State claims said substances geologically are part of the mineral estate and the surface owner other than the State of Utah in not legally entitled to said resources and substances. In the event the surface owner in said lands sold or conveyed by the State of Utah with reservation of the minerals to the State, shall make any claim to geothermal steam, hot water, and other water, whether by executing a geothermal energy lease or otherwise makes claim, and a dispute arises between the State of Utah and the surface owner as to whether any geothermal steam, hot water or any other substance or source of energy generated below the surface, is nonmineral in character and independent of minerals reserved to the State of Utah, when and if there is an adjudication by the Supreme Court of the State of Utah adjudging such geothermal steam, hot water or any other underground source of energy to be nonmineral in character and independent of and not part of the mineral estate and to belong to or to be part of the surface estate, the State of Utah as Lessor shall refund that portion of the royalty which can be ascertained to have been paid for any substances adjudged to be independent of and not part of the mineral estate, upon ascertainment of what recovered substances is mineral and what is nonmineral and the proportionate value of the materials or substances nonmineral in character, to which the surface owner would be entitled by virtue of such judicial determination. Under no conditions will any rental paid by the lessee to the lessor be refunded.</p>
          <p id="s1p24">1.2No Warranty of Title. Lessor claims title to the mineral estate covered by this Lease. Lessor does not warrant title nor represent that no one will dispute the title asserted by Lessor. It is expressly agreed that Lessor shall not be liable to Lessee for any alleged deficiency in title to the mineral estate, nor shall Lessee become entitled to any refund for any rentals, bonuses, or royalties paid under this Lease in the event of title failure.</p>

          <p id="s1p27">2.RESERVATIONS TO LESSOR. Subject to the exclusive rights and privileges granted to Lessee under this Lease, and further provided that Lessor shall refrain from taking actions with respect to the Leased Premises that may unreasonably interfere with Lessee’s operations, Lessor hereby excepts and reserves from the operation of this Lease the following rights and privileges (to the extent that Lessor has the right to grant such rights and privileges):</p>
          <p id="s1p28">2.1Rights-of-Way and Easements. Lessor reserves the right, following consultation with the Lessee, to establish rights-of-way and easements upon, through or over the Leased Premises, under terms and conditions that will not unreasonably interfere with operations under this Lease, for roads, pipelines, electric transmission lines, transportation and utility corridors, mineral access, and any other purpose deemed reasonably necessary by Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p29">2.2Other Mineral Leases. Lessor reserves the right to enter into mineral leases and agreements with third parties covering minerals other than the leased substances, under terms and conditions that will not unreasonably interfere with operations under this Lease in accordance with Lessor’s regulations, if any, governing multiple mineral development.</p>
          <p id="s1p30">2.3Use and Disposal of Surface. To the extent that Lessor owns the surface estate of the Leased Premises and subject to the rights granted to the Lessee pursuant to this Lease, Lessor reserves the right to use, lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of the surface estate or any part thereof, provided that any such actions will not unreasonably interfere with operations under this Lease. Lessor shall notify Lessee of any such sale, lease, or other disposition of the surface estate.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">2.4Rights Not Expressly Granted, Lessor further reserves all rights and privileges of every kind and nature, except as specifically granted in this Lease, provided that any actions under such reservations will not unreasonably interfere with operations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">3.TERM OF LEASE; MINIMUM ROYALTIES; READJUSTMENT.</p>
          <p id="s1p33">3.1Primary Term. This Lease is granted for a “primary term” of 10 years from the date hereinabove first written.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">3.2Extension Beyond Primary Term By Production. Subject to Lessee’s compliance with the other provisions of this Lease, this Lease shall remain in effect beyond the primary term so long as leased substances are being produced in sufficient commercial quantities as defined herein, from the Leased Premises, or from lands constituting a logical geothermal unit as approved by Lessor in its reasonable discretion. For purposes of this lease, production of leased substances in paying quantities shall mean the sale of the leased substances during the lease-year in an amount sufficient to cover all operating expenses accruing to the lessee pursuant to the leasehold for that lease year, including the payment of all taxes and the payment of rentals and royalties accruing to the Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p35">3.3Extension Beyond Primary Term By Diligent Development, Financial Investment and Minimum Royalty. In the absence of actual production in paying quantities as set forth in paragraph 3.2, Extension Beyond Primary Term, this Lease shall remain in effect beyond the primary term only if the Lessee is engaged in diligent operations, exploration or development activity, as well as making a substantial financial investment, which in Lessor’s sole discretion is calculated to advance development or production of leased substances from the Leased Premises or lands constituting a logical geothermal unit as approved by the Director which includes the Leased Premises, and Lessee pays the annual minimum royalty set forth in Paragraph 3.4, Minimum Royalty, in advance, on or before the anniversary date of the date first written hereinabove.</p>
          <p id="s1p36">Geothermal Energy Lease 4/1/07</p>
          <p id="s1p37">Page No. 4</p>
          <p id="s1p38">3.4Minimum Royalty. Commencing with the eleventh lease year of this lease Lessee shall pay Lessor an annual minimum royalty, in advance, on or before the Effective Date and each anniversary thereof. The advance annual minimum royalty shall be in the amount of $5.00 per acre. Lessee may credit each lease-year’s minimum royalty payment against actual production royalties accruing during that lease year, but such credit shall not carry over beyond the lease year in which the advance royalty was paid. Minimum royalties may not be credited against the annual rentals or bonus bids.</p>
          <p id="s1p39">3.5Expiration; Cessation of Production. This Lease may not be extended pursuant to paragraph 3.3, Diligent Operations, beyond the end of the twentieth year after the Effective Date except by the actual production of leased substances in commercial quantities from the Leased Premises or from lands constituting an approved unit which includes the Leased Premises, or except by suspension of the Lease pursuant to Article 17.3, unless otherwise specifically approved in writing by the Director of the Trust Lands Administration in the interest of the trust beneficiaries. After expiration of the primary term, this Lease will expire of its own terms, without the necessity of any notice or action by Lessor, if: (a) Lessee fails to produce leased substances in accordance with Article 3.2; (b) Lessee ceases to engage in exploration, development, or operations or fails to pay annual advance minimum royalties in accordance with Article 3.4; or, (c) the Director fails to make a written determination that it is in the interest of the trust beneficiaries to extend this lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p40">3.6Readjustment Option. At the end of the primary term and at the end of each period of ten (10) years thereafter (“Readjustment Period”), Lessor may exercise its option to readjust the terms and conditions of this Lease, to obtain market value return to the Lessor, (including, without limitation: rental rates, minimum royalties, royalty rates, valuation methods, and provisions concerning reclamation). Notice of intent to exercise the right to readjust is timely given by Lessor if mailed prior to the end of the Readjustment Period to the last address set forth for Lessee in Lessor’s files. Lessor shall have up to one year after exercising its option to readjust to review and communicate in writing the final readjusted terms of the lease. If within thirty (30) days after submission of the readjusted lease terms to the Lessee, the Lessee determines that any or all of the proposed readjusted terms and conditions are unreasonable, then Lessee shall so notify Lessor in writing and the parties, acting reasonably, shall attempt to resolve the objectionable term or condition. If the parties are unable, acting reasonably, to resolve the matter and agree upon the readjusted terms and conditions as submitted by Lessor at the end of the Readjustment Period, Lessee shall forfeit any right to the continued extension of this lease, and the lease shall automatically terminate, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude Lessee from appealing any readjustment by Lessor pursuant to applicable law.</p>
          <p id="s1p41">4.BONUS BID. Lessee agrees to pay Lessor an initial bonus bid in the sum of $ N/A dollars as partial consideration for Lessor’s issuance of this Lease, payable in cash prior to execution of this lease. The initial bonus bid may not be credited against annual rentals, annual minimum royalties or production royalties accruing pursuant to this lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p42">5.RENTALS/MINIMUM RENTALS. Lessee agrees to pay Lessor an annual rental of $1.00 for each acre and fractional part thereof within the Leased Premises; provided however, the minimum annual rental required by this lease shall be $500.00 irrespective of acreage. Lessee shall promptly pay annual rentals each year in advance on or before the anniversary date of the</p>
          <p id="s1p43">Geothermal Energy Lease 4/1/07</p>
          <p id="s1p44">Page No. 5</p>
          <p id="s1p45">Effective Date. The rental payment for a mineral lease year may be credited against production royalties only as they accrue for that lease year. The Lessee may not credit rentals paid for one lease year against production royalties accruing to another lease year. Rental payments may not be credited against minimum royalties or bonus bids accruing to any lease year.</p>
          <p id="s1p46">6.ROYALTIES.</p>
          <p id="s1p47">6.1Production Royalties. Lessee shall pay lessor a production royalty on the basis of 10% of the gross value of the leased substance, including all bonuses and allowances received by Lessee, at the point of shipment from leased premises or the geothermal field, of the first marketable product or products produced from the leased substances and sold under a bonafide contract of sale, whether or not such product or products are produced through chemical or mechanical treating or processing of the leased substances raw material. Payment or reimbursement by the purchaser for any operator expense, including without limitation payment for reinjection or disposal of water into the well or aquifer or otherwise, are part of gross value for royalty purposes.</p>
          <p id="s1p48">6.2Non-Arms Length Transactions. In the event that Lessee uses, sells or otherwise disposes of leased substances without a non-arm’s-length contract or bill of sale, Lessee shall promptly notify Lessor of such use, sale or disposal. The Director may then determine and assign the Gross Value to the leased substances for royalty purposes after taking into account spot market prices, the value of similar or like leased substances reported by other trust lands lessees, the value of like mineral commodities as reported by the United States Geological Survey, and other pertinent economic data regarding the fair market value of the leased substances, f.o.b. the mine.</p>
          <p id="s1p49">6.3No Deductions. It is expressly understood and agreed that none of Lessee’s production or processing costs, including but not limited to costs for materials, labor, overhead, distribution, processing, or general and administrative activities, may be deducted in computing Lessor’s royalty. All such costs shall be entirely borne by Lessee and are anticipated by the rate of royalty set forth in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p50">6.4Royalty Payment. For all leased substances that are sold during a particular month, Lessee shall pay royalties to Lessor on or before the end of the next succeeding month. Royalty payments shall be accompanied by a verified statement, in a form approved by Lessor, stating the amount of leased substances sold, the gross proceeds accruing to Lessee, and any other information reasonably required by Lessor to verify production and disposition of the leased substances or leased substances products. Delinquent royalties may be subject to late fees and penalties in accordance with Lessor’s Rules.</p>
          <p id="s1p51">6.5Suspension, Waiver or Reduction of Rents or Royalties. Lessor, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, is authorized to waive, suspend, or reduce the rental or minimum royalty, or reduce the royalty applicable with respect to the entire Lease, whenever in Lessor’s sole judgment it is necessary to do so in order to promote development, or whenever in the Lessor’s sole judgment the Lease cannot be successfully operated under the terms provided herein and continued operations are in the trust land beneficiaries best interest.</p>
          <p id="s1p52">7.RECORDKEEPING; INSPECTION; AUDITS.</p>
          <p id="s1p53">7.1Registered Agent; Records. Lessee shall maintain a registered agent within the State of Utah to whom any and all notices may be sent by Lessor and upon whom process may be served. Lessee shall also maintain an office within the State of Utah containing originals or copies of all maps, engineering data, permitting materials, books, records or contracts (whether such</p>

          <p id="s1p56">documents are in paper or electronic form) generated by Lessee that pertain in any way to leased substances production, output and valuation; mine operations; assays; processing returns; leased substances sales and dispositions; and calculation of royalties. Lessee shall maintain such documents for at least seven years after the date of the leased substances production to which the documents pertain.</p>
          <p id="s1p57">7.2Inspection. Lessor’s employees and authorized agents at Lessor’s sole risk and expense shall have the right to enter the Leased Premises, to go on any part of the Leased Premises to examine, inspect, survey and take measurements for the purposes of verifying production amounts and proper lease operations. Upon reasonable notice to Lessee, Lessor’s employees and authorized agents shall further have the right to audit, examine and copy (at Lessor’s expense) all documents described in paragraph 7.1, Registered Agent; Records, whether such documents are located on the leased premises or elsewhere. Lessee shall furnish all conveniences necessary for said inspection, survey, or examination; provided, however, that such inspections shall be conducted in a manner that is in conformance with all applicable mine safety regulations and does not unreasonably interfere with Lessee’s operations.</p>
          <p id="s1p58">7.3Geologic Information. In the event Lessee conducts core-drilling operations or other geologic evaluation of the Leased Premises, Lessor may inspect core samples, evaluations thereof, and proprietary geologic information concerning the Leased Premises. Upon request by Lessor, Lessee shall timely provide Lessor with a true and correct copy of all such evaluations, geological reports, drilling logs, assays and interpretive maps of the leased substances within the leased lands.</p>
          <p id="s1p59">7.4Confidentiality. Any and all documents and geologic data obtained by Lessor through the exercise of its rights as set forth in paragraphs 7.2, Inspection., and 7.3, Geologic Information., may be declared confidential information by Lessee, in which event Lessor and its authorized agents shall maintain such documents and geologic data as protected records under the Utah Governmental Records Access Management Act or other applicable privacy statute, and shall not disclose the same to any third party without the written consent of Lessee, or as required under the order of a court of competent jurisdiction requiring such disclosure, provided that Lessor’s obligations of confidentiality to Lessee shall cease upon termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p60">8.USE OF SURFACE ESTATE.</p>
          <p id="s1p61">8.1Lessor-Owned Surface. If Lessor owns the surface estate of all or some portion of the Leased Premises, at the time of the execution of this Lease, by issuance of this Lease the Lessee has been granted the right to make use of such lands to the extent reasonably necessary and expedient for the economic operation of the leasehold. Such surface uses shall be exercised subject to the rights reserved to Lessor as provided in paragraph 2, RESERVATIONS TO LESSOR, and without unreasonable interference with the rights of any prior or subsequent lessee of Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p62">8.2Split-Estate Lands. If Lessor does not own the surface estate of any portion of the Leased Premises, Lessee’s access to and use of the surface of such lands shall be determined by applicable law governing mineral development on split-estate lands, including without limitation applicable statutes governing access by mineral owners to split estate lands, and reclamation and bonding requirements. Lessee shall indemnify, defend and hold Lessor harmless for all claims, causes of action, damages, costs and expenses (including attorney’s fees and costs) arising out of or related to damage caused by Lessee’s operations to surface lands or improvements owned by third parties.</p>

If Lessee purchases or acquires an existing water right for use in association with this lease or operations upon the Leased Premises, Lessor shall have the option to acquire that portion of such water right as was used on the Leased Premises upon expiration or termination of this Lease. The option price for such water right shall be the fair market value of the water right as of the date of expiration or termination of this Lease. Upon expiration or termination of this Lease, Lessee shall notify Lessor in writing of all water rights purchased or acquired by Lessee for leased substances mining operations on the Leased Premises and its estimate of the fair market value of such water right. Lessor shall then have forty-five (45) days to exercise its option to acquire the water by payment to Lessee of the estimated fair market value. If Lessor disagrees with Lessee’s estimate of fair market value, Lessor shall notify Lessee of its disagreement within the 45 day option exercise period. The fair market value of the water right shall then be appraised by a single appraiser mutually acceptable to both parties, which appraisal shall be final and not subject to review or appeal. If the parties cannot agree upon the choice of an appraiser, the fair market value of the water right shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Conveyance of any water right pursuant to this paragraph shall be by quit claim deed.</p>
          <p id="s1p81">12.ASSIGNMENT OR SUBLEASE: OVERRIDING ROYALTIES.</p>
          <p id="s1p82">12.1Consent Required. Lessee shall not assign or sublease this Lease in whole or in part, or otherwise assign or convey any rights or privileges granted by this Lease, including, without limitation, creation of overriding royalties or production payments, without the prior written consent of Lessor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Lessee agrees that Lessor, in determining whether to consent to any proposed assignment, may reasonably consider the proposed assignee’s financial capacity, ability to market and process leased substances, and may refuse to consent to such assignment if, in the Lessor’s reasonable opinion, the proposed assignee lacks the necessary financial or technical capacity to mine, market and/or process leased substances in a manner comparable to Lessee. Any assignment, sublease or other conveyance made without prior written consent of Lessor shall have no legal effect unless and until approved in writing by Lessor. Exercise of any right with respect to the Leased Premises in violation of this provision shall constitute a default under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">12.2Binding Effect. All of the terms and provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns, and sublessees.</p>
          <p id="s1p84">12.3Limitation on Overriding Royalties. Lessor reserves the right to disapprove the creation of an overriding royalty or production payment that would, in Lessor’s reasonable discretion, constitute an unreasonable economic burden upon operation of the Lease. In exercising its discretion to disapprove the creation of an overriding royalty, Lessor shall consult with Lessee and any third parties involved and shall prepare findings to evidence the basis of its decision. Any transfer in interest which would create a cumulative overriding royalty burden in excess of 20% shall not be approved.</p>
          <p id="s1p85">13.OPERATIONS.</p>
          <p id="s1p86">13.1Permitting. Before Lessee commences exploration, drilling, or mining operations on the Leased Premises, it shall have obtained such permits and posted such bonds as may be required under applicable provisions of the Utah Mined Land Reclamation Act and associated regulations. Lessee shall maintain any required permits in place for the duration of mining operations and reclamation. Upon request, Lessee shall provide Lessor with a copy of all regulatory filings relating to permitting matters.</p>
          <p id="s1p87">Geothermal Energy Lease 4/1/07</p>
          <p id="s1p88">Page No. 10</p>
          <p id="s1p89">13.2Plan of Operations. Prior to the commencement of any exploration, drilling, or mining operations on the Leased Premises, Lessee shall obtain Lessor’s approval of a plan of operations for the Leased Premises. Lessor may modify the proposed plan of operations as is needed to insure that there is no waste of economically recoverable mineral reserves contained on the Leased Premises. In this context “waste” shall mean the inefficient utilization of, or the excessive or improper loss of an otherwise economically recoverable mineral resource. Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing of its approval or modifications of the plan of operations. The plan of operations submitted by Lessee shall be deemed approved by Lessor if Lessor has not otherwise notified Lessee within sixty (60) days of filing.</p>
          <p id="s1p90">13.3Plan of Operations - Modification. In the event that material changes are required to the plan of operations during the course of mining, Lessee shall submit a modification of the plan of operations to the Lessor. Routine adjustments to the plan of operations based upon geologic circumstances encountered during day-to-day mining operations do not require the submission of a modification. If the proposed changes require emergency action by Lessor, then the Lessee shall so notify the Lessor at the time of submission of the modification and the parties shall use their best efforts to meet the Lessee’s time schedule regarding implementation of the changes. Non-emergency modifications will be reviewed promptly by Lessor to insure that there is no waste of economically recoverable mineral reserves pursuant to the plan of operations, as modified, and Lessor shall notify lessee in writing of its approval or modification of the proposed modification. Modifications shall be deemed approved by Lessor if Lessor has not otherwise notified Lessee within thirty (30) days of filing.</p>
          <p id="s1p91">13.4Mine Maps. Lessee shall maintain at the mine office clear, accurate, and detailed maps of all actual and planned operations. Such maps shall be certified by an engineer or geologist who is professionally licensed by the State of Utah or by a state having a reciprocal licensing agreement with the State of Utah. Lessee shall provide copies of such maps to Lessor upon request.</p>
          <p id="s1p92">13.5Good Mining Practices. Lessee shall conduct exploration and mining operations on the Leased Premises in accordance with standard industry operating practices, and shall avoid waste of economically recoverable leased substances. Lessee shall comply with all regulations and directives of the Mine Safety and Health Administration or successor agencies for the health and safety of employees and workers. Leased substances shall be mined from this Lease by underground methods only.</p>
          <p id="s1p93">13.6Unitization: With the consent and approval of the Lessor, Lessee may commit the Leasehold estate under this lease to a unit, co-operative or other plan of development of the Leasehold herein, with corresponding estate in other State land, Federal Lands, privately owned lands, or Indian lands. If only a portion of the lands covered by this lease shall be committed to a unit or other co-operative plan of development, Lessor may segregate the land area and issue a separate lease for each portion. In the event of unitization of the leasehold estate herein described or some portion thereof with the corresponding leasehold estate in other land the provisions of Paragraph 10 hereof shall he deemed modified as far as essential to be in harmony with such unit agreement.</p>
          <p id="s1p94">14.EQUIPMENT: RESTORATION.</p>
          <p id="s1p95">14.1Equipment. Upon termination of this Lease, Lessee shall remove, and shall have the right to remove, all improvements, equipment, stockpiles, and dumps from the Leased Premises within six (6) months; provided, however, that Lessor may, at</p>
          <p id="s1p96">Geothermal Energy Lease 4/1/07</p>
          <p id="s1p97">Page No. 11</p>
          <p id="s1p98">Lessor’s sole risk and expense, and subject to Lessee’s compliance with requirements imposed by UDOGM and MSHA, require Lessee to retain in place underground timbering supports, shaft linings, rails, and other installations reasonably necessary for future mining of the Leased Premises. All improvements and equipment remaining on the Leased Premises after six (6) months may be deemed forfeited to Lessor upon written notice of such forfeiture to Lessee. Lessee may abandon underground improvements, equipment of any type, stockpiles and dumps in place if such abandonment is in compliance with applicable law, and further provided that Lessee provides Lessor with financial or other assurances sufficient in Lessor’s reasonable discretion to protect Lessor from future environmental liability with respect to such abandonment or any associated hazardous waste spills or releases. Lessee shall identify and locate on the mine map the location of all equipment abandoned on the Lease Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p99">14.2Restoration and Reclamation. Upon termination of this Lease, Lessee shall reclaim the Leased Premises in accordance with the requirements of applicable law, including mine permits and reclamation plans on file with UDOGM. Lessee shall further abate any hazardous condition on or associated with the Leased Premises. Lessee and representatives of all governmental agencies having jurisdiction shall have the right to re-enter the Leased Premises for reclamation purposes for a reasonable period after termination of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p100">15.MULTIPLE MINERAL DEVELOPMENT</p>
          <p id="s1p101">The Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration may designate any lands under its authority as a Multiple Mineral Development Area (MMD). In designated MMDs the Lessor may require in addition to the terms and conditions of this lease such stipulations or restrictions as may be necessary in the determination of the Director to integrate and coordinate the operations of lessees having an interest in the lands in order to conserve natural resource and optimize revenues to the trust-land beneficiaries.</p>
          <p id="s1p102">16.DEFAULT</p>
          <p id="s1p103">16.1Notice of Default; Termination. Upon Lessee’s violation of or failure to comply with any of the terms, conditions or covenants set forth in this Lease, Lessor shall notify Lessee of such default by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at the last address for Lessee set forth in Lessor’s files. Lessee shall then have thirty (30) days, or such longer period as may be granted in writing by Lessor, to either cure the default or request a hearing pursuant to the Lessor’s administrative adjudication rules. In the event Lessee fails to cure the default or request a hearing within the specified time period, Lessor may cancel this Lease without further notice to or appeal by Lessee.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">16.2Effect of Termination. The termination of this Lease for any reason, whether through expiration, cancellation or relinquishment, shall not limit the rights of the Lessor to recover any royalties and/or damages for which Lessee may be liable, to recover on any bond on file, or to seek injunctive relief to enjoin continuing violations of the Lease terms. No remedy or election under this Lease shall be deemed exclusive, but shall, wherever possible, be cumulative with all other remedies available under this Lease, at law, or in equity. Lessee shall surrender the Leased Premises upon termination; however, the obligations of Lessee with respect to reclamation, indemnification and other continuing covenants imposed by this Lease shall survive the termination. All fees, rentals and monies of any type previously paid by the Lessee to the Lessor are forfeited to the trust.</p>

          <p id="s1p107">17.MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">17.1Indemnity. Except as limited by paragraph 7.2, Inspection, Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless for, from and against each and every claim, demand, liability, loss, cost, damage and expense, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and court costs, arising in any way out of Lessee’s occupation and use of the Leased Premises, including without limitation claims for death, personal injury, property damage, and unpaid wages and benefits. Lessee further agrees to indemnify and hold Lessor harmless for, from and against all claims, demands, liabilities, damages and penalties arising out of any failure of Lessee to comply with any of Lessee’s obligations under this Lease, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs. Lessee may be required to obtain insurance in a type and in an amount acceptable to Lessor, naming the Trust Lands Administration, its employees, its Board of trustees and the State of Utah as co-insured parties under the policy.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">17.2Interest. Interest shall accrue and be payable on all obligations arising under this Lease at such current rate as may from time to time be enacted by the Director and recorded in the Director’s Minutes of the School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration. Interest shall accrue and be payable, without necessity of demand, from the date each such obligation shall arise.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">17.3Suspension. In the event that Lessor in its reasonable discretion determines that suspension is necessary in the interests of conservation of the leased substances; that prevailing market conditions for the leased substances render continued operation of the subject property uneconomic, or if Lessee has been prevented from performing any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Lease or from conducting operations by labor strikes, fires, floods, explosions, riots, acts of terrorism, any unusual mining casualties or conditions, Acts of God, government restrictions or orders, severe weather conditions, or other extraordinary events beyond its control, then the time for performance of this Lease by Lessee shall be suspended during the continuance of such conditions or acts which prevent performance, excepting any payments due and owing to Lessor.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">17.4Consent to Suit: Jurisdiction. This Lease shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah. Lessor and Lessee agree that all disputes arising out of this Lease shall be litigated only in the Third Judicial District Court for Salt Lake County, Utah, and Lessee consents to the jurisdiction of such court. Lessee shall not bring any action against Lessor without exhaustion of available administrative remedies and compliance with applicable requirements of the Utah Governmental Immunity Act.</p>
          <p id="s1p112">17.5No Waiver. No waiver of the breach of any provision of this Lease shall be construed as a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision of this Lease, nor shall the acceptance of rentals or royalties by Lessor during any period of time in which Lessee is in default be deemed to be a waiver of such default.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">17.6Severability. The invalidity of any provision of this Lease, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall in no way affect the validity of any other provision hereof.</p>
