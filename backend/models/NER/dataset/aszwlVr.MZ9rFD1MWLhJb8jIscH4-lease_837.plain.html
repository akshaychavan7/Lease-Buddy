          <p id="s1p8">C. The parties mutually desire to amend the terms of the Lease to expand the Premises and make certain other related changes, all on and subject to the terms and conditions hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p9">Agreement</p>
          <p id="s1p10">Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual terms and conditions herein contained and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p11">1 EFFECTOF ADDENDUM. Landlord and Tenant agree that, notwithstanding anything contained in the Lease to the contrary, the provisions set forth below will be deemed to be part of the Lease and shall supersede, to the extent they differ, any contrary provisions in the Lease. Terms defined in the Lease shall have the same meanings in this Third Addendum, unless a different definition is set forth in this Third Addendum. The term Lease as used herein shall be deemed to include the First Extension Agreement, the Second Extension Agreement, and the First Addendum, and the Second Addendum, each of which may also be referred to separately herein. A true, complete, and correct copy of the Lease as heretofore amended is attached hereto as and incorporated herein by reference. Exhibit A</p>
          <p id="s1p12">2 EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments and changes specified in this Third Addendum shall become effective on June 1, 2014 (the “Effective Date”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Third Addendum shall constitute the fully-binding agreement and contract of the parties from and after the date of the parties’ execution and delivery of this Third Addendum to each other.</p>
          <p id="s1p13">3 LEASE TERM. The Term of the Lease specified in § 1.2 of the Lease as heretofore amended under the Second Addendum shall remain unchanged, and the Expiration Date is August 31, 2016.</p>

          <p id="s1p17">[Suites B, C &amp; D, 18,211 rsf)</p>
          <p id="s1p18">1.1 Option to Renew. Tenant is hereby granted one (1) option to extend (the “Extension Option”) the Term of the Lease for one (1) additional period of two (2) years (the “Extension Period”). The Extension Period term shall begin the first day following the Expiration Date and shall take effect on the same terms and conditions in effect under the Lease immediately prior to the first Extension Period, except that (i) Tenant shall have no further right to extend and (ii) monthly Base Rent shall be the rate which is Fair Market Value (as defined below). The Fair Market Value shall be the effective rent (face rate less free rent) being charged for comparable space in comparable buildings in the vicinity of the Building leased on comparable terms and shall be limited the rates charges in such comparable transactions for tenants renewing or extending their leases.</p>
          <p id="s1p19">(a) Exercise of Option. The Extension Option may be exercised only by (i) delivering in person to Landlord’s Building Manager in the Building Office written notice of Tenant’s irrevocable election to exercise no earlier than ten (10) months and no later than six (6) months prior to the commencement of the Extension Period, and (ii) collecting and retaining in exchange for such notice of exercise an original written receipt therefor signed and dated by Landlord’s Building Manager. Tenant’s exercise of its Extension Option shall not be effective or valid if there is any deviation in the timing or manner of exercise prescribed herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p20">(b) Failure to Exercise. If Tenant shall fail validly and timely to exercise the Option herein granted, said Option shall terminate and shall be null and void and of no further force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p21">(c) Fair Market Value. Provided that Tenant has validly exercised its Option when and as required hereunder, not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the commencement of the Extension Period, Landlord shall provide written notice to Tenant of its determination of the Fair Market Value. Within ten (10) days after receiving such determination (“Tenant’s Review Period”), Tenant shall irrevocably elect, in writing, to do one of the following. (i) accept Landlord’s determination; or (ii) object to Landlord’s determination and with such objection set forth in writing Tenant’s determination of the Fair Market Value. If Tenant so objects, Landlord and Tenant shall attempt in good faith to agree upon such Fair Market Value using their best good-faith efforts. If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement within fifteen (15) days following Tenant’s Review Period (the “Outside Agreement Date”), then each party’s determination shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the then-current rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association, but subject to the instructions set forth in this § 1.1 et seq.. If Tenant objects to Landlord’s determination of Fair Market Value, Tenant shall pay Rent at the Fair Market Value determined by Landlord until the matter is resolved by binding arbitration as provided below subject to retroactive adjustment after the matter is so resolved. If Tenant fails so to accept or object to Landlord’s determination of Fair Market Value in writing within Tenant’s Review Period, Tenant shall conclusively be deemed to have approved of the Fair Market Value as determined by Landlord. The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Value for the Premises is the more accurate as determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements of this § 1.1 et seq.</p>
          <p id="s1p22">(d) Appointment of Arbitrators. Not later than fifteen (15) days following the Outside Agreement Date, Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint one arbitrator who shall by profession be a real estate broker who shall have been active over the ten-year period ending on the date of such appointment in the leasing of commercial properties within Alameda County. The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Value for the Premises is the more accurate as determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements of this § 1.1 et seq.</p>

          <p id="s1p26">[Suites B, C &amp; D, 18,211 rsf)</p>
          <p id="s1p27">(e) Appointment of Third Arbitrator. The two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall within fifteen (15) days of the date of the appointment of the last-appointed arbitrator agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, who shall be qualified under the same criteria as set forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial two arbitrators.</p>
          <p id="s1p28">(f) Arbitrators’ Decision. The three (3) arbitrators shall, within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the third arbitrator, reach a decision as to whether the parties shall use Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Value, and shall notify Landlord and Tenant thereof. The decision of the majority of the three (3) arbitrators shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant. The arbitrators shall not be permitted to set Fair Market Value to any level other than either Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Value.</p>
          <p id="s1p29">(g) Failure to Appoint. If either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the Outside Agreement Date, the arbitrator timely appointed by one of the parties shall reach a decision, notify Landlord and Tenant thereof, and such arbitrator’s decision shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant. If the two (2) arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, both arbitrators shall be dismissed and the matter to be decided shall be forthwith submitted to arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, but subject to the instructions set forth in this § 1.1 et seq..</p>
          <p id="s1p30">(h) Cost of Arbitration. The cost of arbitration shall be paid by Landlord and Tenant equally.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">(i) Default. Tenant’s exercise of the Option shall, at Landlord’s election, be null and void if Tenant is in Default on the date of Tenant’s notice of exercise or at any time thereafter and prior to commencement of the Extension Period. Tenant’s exercise of the Extension Option shall not operate to cure any Default by Tenant nor to extinguish or impair any rights or remedies of Landlord arising by virtue of such Default. If the Lease or Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises shall terminate before Tenant shall have exercised the Extension Option, then immediately upon such termination the Extension Option shall simultaneously terminate and become null and void.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">(j) Time. Time is of the essence of the Extension Option granted hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p33">4 EXPANSIONOF PREMISES. On the Effective Date the Premises shall be expanded by the addition thereto of Suite B in the Building containing approximately 3,990 rentable square feet of space for all purposes under the Lease, as reflected in the Table below and as depicted on the space plan attached hereto as and incorporated herein by reference (the “Space Plan”). Exhibit B</p>
          <p id="s1p34">5 BASE YEAR. As specified in the Table below, the Base Year for the purposes calculating Tenant’s Additional Rent under § 2.3 of the Lease as heretofore amended shall be calendar year 2013 from and after the Effective Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p35">6 MONTHLY BASE RENT. The Base Rent for the Premises specified in § 2(a) of the Lease as heretofore amended shall be the amounts specified as Monthly Base Rent in the Table below for the various periods and spaces set forth in the Table from and after the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt and in order to clarify the parties’ agreement hereunder, the Monthly Base Rent numbers shown in the Table reflect the Base Rent in effect on the original Commencement Date of the Lease as increased by the Base Rent Adjustment as provided in § 2.2 of the Lease. The parties agree that application of the Base Rent Adjustment has resulted in a Base Rent rate of $1.74 per rentable square foot of space in the Premises, which rate has been in effect since September 1, 2013, subject to further adjustment on the next Adjustment Date.</p>

Tenant is hereby granted three (3) successive options to extend (collectively the “Extension Options”) the Term of the Lease for three (3) additional consecutive periods of two (2) years each (collectively the “Extension Periods”).

          <p id="s1p212">(a) Exercise of Options. The Extension Options may be exercised only by (i) delivering in person to Landlord’s Building Manager in the Building Office written notice of Tenant’s irrevocable election to exercise no earlier than ten (10) months and no later than six (6) months prior to the commencement of the first, second, or third Extension Period, as the case may be, and (ii) collecting and retaining in exchange for such notice of exercise an original written receipt therefor signed and dated by Landlord’s Building Manager.

If Landlord exercises its option nullification right hereunder, Landlord shall pay to Tenant (i) a “Nullification Fee” in the amount of Eighty Thousand Dollars ($80,000) and (ii) the reasonable costs incurred by Tenant in moving to a comparable facility of Tenant’s choice in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Nullification Fee, if any, shall be payable by Landlord in full on or before the Expiration Date of the then-current initial Term or Extension Period, as the case may be.</p>
          <p id="s1p214">(c) Failure to Exercise. If Tenant shall fail validly and timely to exercise any of the Options herein granted, said Options shall terminate and shall be null and void and of no further force and effect.</p>

If Tenant so objects, Landlord and Tenant shall attempt in good faith to agree upon such Fair Market Value using their best good-faith efforts. If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement within fifteen (15) days following Tenant’s Review Period (the “Outside Agreement Date”), then each party’s determination shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the then-current rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association, but subject to the instructions set forth in this § 3.1 et seq.. If Tenant objects to Landlord’s determination of Fair Market Value, Tenant shall pay Rent at the Fair Market Value determined by Landlord until the matter is resolved by binding arbitration as provided below subject to retroactive adjustment after the matter is so resolved. If Tenant fails so to accept or object to Landlord’s determination of Fair Market Value in writing within Tenant’s Review Period, Tenant shall conclusively be deemed to have approved of the Fair</p>

The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Value for the Premises is the more accurate as determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements of this § 3.1 et seq.</p>
          <p id="s1p220">(e) Appointment of Arbitrators. Not later than fifteen (15) days following the Outside Agreement Date, Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint one arbitrator who shall by profession be a real estate broker who shall have been active over the ten-year period ending on the date of such appointment in the leasing of commercial properties within Berkeley, California. The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Value for the Premises is the more accurate as determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements of this § 3.1 et seq.</p>

          <p id="s1p333">1.2.2 Options to Renew. Tenant is hereby granted one (1) option to extend (the “Extension Option”) the Term of the Lease for one (1) additional period of two (2) Lease Years (collectively the “Extension Period”). The Extension Period term shall begin the first day following the Expiration Date and shall take effect on the same terms and conditions in effect under the Lease immediately prior to the Extension Period, except that monthly Base Rent shall be the rate which is Fair Market Value (as defined below), except that (i) Tenant shall have no further right to extend and (ii) monthly Base Rent shall be the rate which is Fair Market Value (as defined below). The Fair Market Value shall be the effective rent (face rate less free rent) being charged for comparable space in comparable buildings in the vicinity of the Building leased on comparable terms.</p>
          <p id="s1p334">(a) Exercise of Option. The Extension Options may be exercised only by giving Landlord written notice of Tenant’s irrevocable election to exercise no earlier than ten (10) months and no later than six (6) months prior to the commencement of the Extension Period.</p>

          <p id="s1p339">(b) Failure to Exercise. If Tenant shall fail validly and timely to exercise either of the options herein granted, said option shall terminate and shall be null and void and of no further force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p340">(c) Determination of Fair Market Value. Not less than one hundred and fifty (150) days prior to the commencement of the Extension Term, Landlord shall provide written notice to Tenant of its determination of the Fair Market Value. Within ten (10) days after receiving such determination (“Tenant’s Review Period”), Tenant shall irrevocably elect, in writing, to do one of the following: (i) accept Landlord’s determination; or (ii) object to Landlord’s determination and with such objection set forth in writing Tenant’s determination of the Fair Market Value. If Tenant so objects, Landlord and Tenant shall attempt in good faith to agree upon such Fair Market Value using their best good faith efforts. If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement within fifteen (15) days following Tenant’s Review Period (the “Outside Agreement Date”), then each party’s determination shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with § 25 below, but subject to the instructions set forth in this § 25 et seq. If Tenant objects to Landlord’s determination of Fair Market Value, Tenant shall pay Rent at the Fair Market Value determined by Landlord until the matter is resolved by binding arbitration as provided below subject to retroactive adjustment after the matter is so resolved. If Tenant fails so to accept or object to Landlord’s determination of Fair Market Value in writing within Tenant’s Review Period, Tenant shall conclusively be deemed to have approved of the Fair Market Value as determined by Landlord. The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Value for the Premises is the more accurate as determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements of this § 25 et seq.</p>
          <p id="s1p341">(d) Default. Tenant’s exercise of the Options shall, at Landlord’s election, be null and void if Tenant is in Default on the date of Tenant’s notice of exercise or at any time thereafter and prior to commencement of the Extension Period. Tenant’s exercise of the Extension Option shall not operate to cure any Default by Tenant nor to extinguish or impair any rights or remedies of Landlord arising by virtue of such Default.</p>
          <p id="s1p342">(e) Time. Time is of the essence of the Extension Option granted hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p343">2 Rent. The “Rent” reserved under this Lease, for the Term thereof, shall consist of the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p344">(a) “Base Rent” as shown in the Table per month, which shall be payable in advance on the first day of each and every calendar month during the Term of this Lease, except that Tenant shall pay the first month’s Base Rent due under the Lease upon the execution and delivery of this Lease by Tenant; and</p>
          <p id="s1p345">(b) “Additional Rent” consisting of any and all other sums of money as shall become payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder; and Landlord shall have the same remedies for default in the payment of Additional Rent as for a default in payment of Base Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p346">2.2 Base Rent Adjustment. If the CPI on any anniversary of the Commencement Date shall be greater than the CPI for the Commencement Date, monthly Base Rent commencing on each anniversary of the Commencement Date shall be adjusted by adding an amount (the “CPI Escalation Amount”) equal to the product obtained by multiplying the monthly Base Rent by the percentage increase in the CPI from the Commencement Date through the relevant anniversary of the Commencement Date, provided that in no event shall the new rent be less than that charged for the prior twelve-month period. “CPI” shall mean the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, All Items, San Francisco-Oakland-San José, California (Base year 1982-1984=100) published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of</p>

If the CPI becomes unavailable to the public because publication is discontinued, or otherwise, Landlord shall substitute therefor a comparable index based upon changes in the cost of living or purchasing power of the consumer dollar published by a governmental agency, major bank, other financial institution, university, or recognized financial publisher. If the CPI is available on a monthly (or alternating monthly) basis, the CPI for the months in which (or immediately preceding, as the case may be) the Commencement Date and Adjustment Date respectively occur shall be used.</p>

An amount equal to Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the increase, if any, in total Real Estate Taxes paid or incurred by Landlord during each Adjustment Period which exceeds the amount of “Base Real Estate Taxes,” which shall mean the total of Real Estate Taxes paid or incurred by Landlord during the Base Year. “Real Estate Taxes” means any and all ad valorem real property taxes and any form of assessment, levy, charge, or other imposition as shown on Landlord’s tax statement from the County Assessor which Landlord shall pay during any Adjustment Period because of or in connection with the ownership, leasing, or operation of the Development, together with reasonable legal and other professional fees, costs, and disbursements incurred in connection with proceedings to contest, determine or reduce Real Estate Taxes.</p>

          <p id="s1p362">Cost paid or incurred by Landlord during the Base Year. “Insurance Costs” means all insurance premiums for any insurance policies covering the Development deemed necessary or desirable by Landlord as determined by Landlord in accordance with the reasonable practice of prudent landlords in the vicinity of the Development (including public liability, property damage, earthquake if commercially reasonable, and fire and extended coverage insurance for the full replacement cost of the Building and any other structure of the Development as required by Landlord or its lenders for the Development).</p>
          <p id="s1p363">As used herein, “Adjustment Period” means each calendar year of which any portion occurs during the Term, excluding the Base Year and beginning with the Adjustment Date (January 1 st) that occurs in the first calendar year immediately following the Base Year; and “Tenant’s Pro Rata Share” means the percentage labeled as such in the Table in § 1 above, calculated by dividing the agreed rentable area of the Premises (numerator) by the agreed rentable area of the Development (denominator) and expressing the resulting quotient as a percentage. Tenant’s Pro Rata Share shall be increased during the Term in proportion to any increase in the area of the Premises in accordance with the formula stated herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p364">2.3.2 Exclusions from CAM Charges. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this § 2.3 et seq., Cam Charges shall not include (A) depreciation, interest, and amortization on any mortgage or deed of trust or other debt costs or ground lease payments, if any; (B) legal fees in connection with leasing, tenant disputes, or enforcement of leases; (C) real estate brokers’ leasing commissions; (D) improvements or alterations to tenant spaces; (E) the cost of providing any utility or service directly to, and reimbursed or paid directly by, any tenant; (F) any costs expressly excluded from CAM Charges elsewhere in this Lease; (G) costs of arty items to the extent Landlord receives reimbursement from insurance proceeds or from a third party (such proceeds to be deducted from CAM Charges in the year in which received); (H) capital expenditures, except those expressly permitted above; provided, all such permitted capital expenditures (together with reasonable financing charges) shall be amortized for purposes of this Lease over the shorter of (x) their useful lives, (y) the period during which the reasonably estimated savings in Operating Expenses equals the expenditures, or (z) three (3) years.</p>
          <p id="s1p365">2.3.3 Manner of Payment. To provide for current payments of the Rental Adjustment, Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent during each Adjustment Period an amount equal to Landlord’s estimate of the Rental Adjustment which will be payable by Tenant for such Adjustment Period. Such payments shall be made in monthly installments, commencing on the first day of the month following the month in which Landlord notifies Tenant of the amount it is to pay hereunder and continuing until the first day of the month following the month in which Landlord gives Tenant a new notice of the estimated Rental Adjustment. It is the intention hereunder to estimate from time to time the amount of Tenant’s Rental Adjustment for each Adjustment Period and then to effect a reconciliation in the following year based on the actual expenses incurred for the preceding Adjustment Period, as provided in § 2.3.4 below.</p>
          <p id="s1p366">2.3.4 Reconciliation. On or before the first day of April of each year after the first Adjustment Period (or as soon thereafter as is practical), Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement (the “Statement”) setting forth the Rental Adjustment for the preceding year. If the actual Rental Adjustment for the preceding Adjustment Period exceeds the total of the estimated monthly payments made by Tenant for such Adjustment Period, Tenant shall pay Landlord the amount of the deficiency within ten (10) days of the receipt of the Statement. If such total of estimated payments made exceeds the actual Rental Adjustment for such Adjustment Period, then Tenant shall receive a credit for the difference against payments of Rent next due. If the credit is due from Landlord on the Expiration Date, Landlord shall pay Tenant the amount of the credit, less any Rent then due. The obligations of Tenant and Landlord to make payments required under this § 2.3.4 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term of this Lease. Upon request, tenant may review insurance premiums, policies, and tax bills within thirty (30) days of the Statement.</p>

          <p id="s1p371">2.3.5 Proration of Rental Adjustment. If the Term does not commence on January 1 or does not end on December 31, Tenant’s obligations to pay estimated and actual amounts towards Real Estate Taxes, CAM Charges, and Insurance Costs for such first or final calendar year shall be prorated to reflect the portion of such year(s) included in the Term. Such proration shall be made by multiplying the total estimated or actual (as the case may be) Real Estate Taxes, CAM Charges, and / or Insurance Costs (as the case may be) for such calendar year(s), as well as the Base Real Estate Taxes, Base CAM Charges, and / or Base Insurance Costs (as the case may be), by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days of the Term during such calendar year, and the denominator of which shall be three hundred sixty-five (365).</p>
          <p id="s1p372">2.3.6 Gross-up. If the Building is less than ninety-five percent (95%) occupied during the Base Year or any Adjustment Period, then CAM Charges, Insurance Costs, and Real Estate Taxes for such Base Year or Adjustment Period (as the case maybe) shall be “grossed up” to that amount of CAM Charges, Insurance Costs, and Real Estate Taxes that, using reasonable projections, would normally have been incurred during such Base Year or Adjustment Period (as the case may be) if the Building had been ninety-five percent (95%) occupied during such Base Year or Adjustment Period (as the case may be), as determined in accordance with sound accounting and management practices, consistently applied. Only those component elements or items of expense of CAM Charges, Insurance Costs, and Real Estate Taxes that are affected by variations in occupancy levels shall be grossed up.</p>
          <p id="s1p373">2.4 Payment of Rent. Tenant shall pay the Base Rent and Additional Rent promptly when due, without demand therefor and without any abatement, deduction, or setoff whatsoever, except as may be expressly provided in this Lease. Tenant shall pay the Rent to Landlord, in lawful money of the United States of America, at Landlord’s office at the Building or at such other place, or to such agent and at such place, as Landlord may designate by notice to Tenant. If the Commencement Date occurs on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, the Base Rent for such calendar month shall be prorated, and the balance of the first month’s Base Rent theretofore paid shall be credited against the next monthly installment of Base Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p374">2.5 Late Charges. Tenant acknowledges that the late payment of any monthly Rent will cause Landlord to lose the use of that money and incur costs and expenses not contemplated under this Lease, including administrative and collection costs and processing and account expenses, the exact amount of which it is difficult to ascertain. Therefore, if any such installment is not received by Landlord within ten (10) days from the date it is due, Tenant shall pay Landlord a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of such installment. Landlord and Tenant agree that this late charge represents a reasonable estimate of such costs and expenses and is fair compensation to Landlord for the loss suffered from such nonpayment by Tenant. In addition, any check returned by the bank for any reason will be considered late and will be subject to all late charges plus a Twenty Dollar ($20.00) fee. After two such occasions in any twelve (12) month period, Landlord will have the right to require payment by a cashier’s check or money order. Acceptance of any late charge shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default with respect to such nonpayment by Tenant nor prevent Landlord from exercising any other rights or remedies available to Landlord under this Lease or at law.</p>
          <p id="s1p375">3 SECURITY DEPOSIT. Tenant shall deposit with Landlord the amount of Twenty Thousand One Hundred Eighty-Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($20,132.50) (the “Security Deposit”) upon Tenant’s execution and submission of this Lease. The Security Deposit shall serve as security for the prompt, full, and faithful performance by Tenant of the terms and provisions of this Lease. Landlord shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from Landlord’s general funds or pay interest on the Security Deposit.</p>

          <p id="s1p380">3.1 Application of Deposit. In the event that Tenant is in Default hereunder and fails to cure within any applicable time permitted under this Lease, or in the event that Tenant owes any amounts to Landlord upon the expiration of this Lease, Landlord may use or apply the whole or any part of the Security Deposit for the payment of Tenant’s obligations hereunder. The use or application of the Security Deposit or any portion thereof shall not prevent Landlord from exercising any other right or remedy provided hereunder or under any Law and shall not be construed as liquidated damages.</p>
          <p id="s1p381">3.2 Restoration of Full Deposit. In the event the Security Deposit is reduced by such use or application, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord, within ten (10) days after written notice, an amount sufficient to restore the full amount of the Security Deposit. If the Premises shall be expanded at any time, or if the Term shall be extended at any increased rate of Rent, the Security Deposit shall thereupon be proportionately increased.</p>
          <p id="s1p382">3.3 Disposition of Security Deposit. After the Expiration Date or any earlier termination of the Lease, any remaining portion of the Security Deposit shall be returned to Tenant in accordance with the provisions of § 1950.7 of the California Civil Code.</p>
          <p id="s1p383">4 USE.

Tenant shall not commit any waste upon the Premises or any nuisance or act which may disturb the quiet enjoyment of any tenant in the Building.</p>

          <p id="s1p392">5.1.2 Tenant’s Improvement Allowance. In addition to Landlord’s performance of the Work specified in § 5.1.1 above, Landlord agrees to make available to Tenant an improvement allowance in the amount of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) (the “Allowance”) to be utilized by Tenant to pay the cost of any Tenant’s Work that Tenant may elect to complete in the Premises in connection with its preparations for the occupancy of the Premises. Landlord agrees to reimburse Tenant for the cost of the Tenant’s Work, up to the maximum amount of the Allowance, promptly after receipt from Tenant of invoices, paid receipts, and such other documentation as Landlord may reasonably require in connection with Tenant’s completion of Tenant’s Work. Tenant agrees that the Allowance shall be repaid to Landlord as Additional Rent in monthly installments of Thirty Dollars and Eighty Eight cents ($30.88) per month for each increment of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) or part thereof that Tenant elects to draw of the available Supplementary Allowance as provided herein, which increase assumes an amortization period of three (3) years Tenant agrees promptly to execute and deliver to Landlord an amendment to the Lease to reflect the increase in the Rent thereunder which results from the utilization of the Allowance described herein as soon as the amount of such increase is liquidated and as soon as such amendment is presented to Tenant for execution. The increase shall be deemed an item of Additional Rent under § 2.3 above. Tenant agrees that the unamortized portion of the Supplementary Allowance shall be immediately due and payable to Landlord if Tenant defaults under the Lease or if the Lease terminates for any reason prior to the Expiration Date specified in the Table in the Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p394">(a) Substantial Completion of Work. The Work has been substantially completed; and it shall be so deemed notwithstanding the fact that minor or insubstantial details of construction, mechanical adjustment, or decoration remain to be performed, the noncompletion of which does not materially interfere with Tenant’s beneficial use of the Premises for their intended purposes;</p>
          <p id="s1p395">(b) Access and Services. Reasonable means of access and facilities necessary to Tenant’s use and occupancy of the Premises, including corridors, elevators, stairways, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, sanitary, water, and electrical facilities (but exclusive of parking facilities) have been installed and are in reasonably good operating order and available to Tenant; and</p>

During any period that Tenant shall be permitted to enter the Premises prior to the Commencement Date other than to occupy the same (e.g., to perform alterations or improvements), Tenant shall comply with all terms and provisions of this Lease, except those provisions requiring the payment of Rent. Landlord shall permit early entry, provided the Premises are legally available and Landlord has completed any Work required under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p404">5.4 Notice of Defects. It shall be conclusively presumed upon Tenant’s taking actual possession of the Premises that the same were in satisfactory condition (except for latent defects) as of the date of such taking of possession, unless within thirty (30) days after the Commencement Date Tenant shall give Landlord notice in writing specifying the respects in which the Premises were not in satisfactory condition.</p>

The actions described in the foregoing sentence are referred to collectively herein as “Transfers.” Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of its intent to effectuate any Transfer not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date of any such proposed Transfer. If the Premises or any part thereof be sublet or occupied by anybody other than Tenant, Landlord may, after default by Tenant, collect rent from the subtenant or occupant and apply the net amount collected to the Rent herein reserved; but no Transfer, occupancy, or collection shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions hereof, the acceptance of the subtenant or occupant as tenant or a release of Tenant from the further performance hereunder by Tenant.

All property removed from the Premises by Landlord pursuant to any provisions of this Lease or any Law may be handled or stored by Landlord at Tenant’s expense, and Landlord shall in no event be responsible for the value, preservation, or safekeeping thereof. All property not removed from the Premises or retaken from storage by Tenant within thirty (30) days after expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or Tenant’s right to possession shall at Landlord’s option be conclusively deemed to have been conveyed by Tenant to Landlord as if by bill of sale without payment by Landlord. Unless prohibited by applicable Laws, Landlord shall have a lien against such property for the costs incurred in removing and storing the same.</p>
          <p id="s1p494">19 DESTRUCTIONOF PREMISES. Landlord and Tenant agree that their respective rights and obligations in the event of any damage or destruction of the Premises or Building shall be governed exclusively by this Lease. Tenant, as a material inducement to Landlord entering into this Lease, irrevocably waives and releases Tenant’s rights under California Civil Code §§ 1932(2), 1933(4), and 1942, as the same may be modified or replaced hereafter.

If such repairs cannot be made within sixty (60) days, Landlord at its option may make the same within a reasonable time, this Lease continuing in effect with the rent proportionately abated as aforesaid; and in the event that Landlord shall not elect to make such repairs which cannot be made within sixty (60) days, this Lease may be terminated by either party upon written notice, effective as of the date of such notice.</p>

          <p id="s1p519">20.2 Landlord’s Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, Landlord shall have the right, in addition to any other rights or remedies Landlord may have, at Landlord’s option, without further notice or demand of any kind, to elect to do one of the following alternatives:</p>
          <p id="s1p520">(a) Terminate this Lease and Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises, re-enter the Premises, and take possession thereof; and Tenant shall have no further claim to the Premises or under this Lease; or</p>
          <p id="s1p521">(b) Continue this Lease in effect and collect any unpaid Rent or other charges which have theretofore accrued or which thereafter become due and payable. It is intended hereunder that Landlord have the remedy described in California Civil Code § 1951.4, which provides that a landlord may continue a lease in effect after a tenant’s breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due, if tenant has the right to sublease or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations.</p>
          <p id="s1p522">In the event of any re-entry or retaking of possession by Landlord, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to remove all or any part of Tenant’s Property from the Premises and to place such property in storage at a public warehouse at the expense and risk of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p523">20.3 No Waiver of Default. The waiver by Landlord of any Event of Default or of any other breach of any term, covenant, or condition of this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant; or condition or of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant, or condition. Acceptance of Rent by Landlord subsequent to any Event of Default or breach hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of any preceding Event of Default or breach other than the failure to pay the particular Rent so accepted, regardless of Landlord’s knowledge of any breach at the time of such acceptance of Rent. Landlord shall not be deemed to have waived any term, covenant, or condition of this Lease, unless Landlord gives Tenant written notice of such waiver. Tenant should not rely upon Landlord’s failure or delay in enforcing any right or remedy hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p524">20.4 Landlord’s Right to Cure. If Tenant defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under this Lease, Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to), without waiving such default, perform the same for the account and at the expense of Tenant. Tenant shall pay Landlord all costs of such performance promptly upon receipt of a bill therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p525">20.5 Damages. Should Landlord elect to terminate this Lease under the provisions of § 20.2(a) above, Landlord may recover as damages from Tenant the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p526">(i) Past Rent: The worth at the time of the award of any unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p527">(ii) Rent Prior to Award: The worth at the time of the award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus</p>

          <p id="s1p533">(iv) Proximately Caused Damages: Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including, but not limited to, any costs or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), incurred by Landlord in (I) retaking possession of the Premises; (ii) maintaining the Premises after Tenant’s default; (iii) preparing the Premises for reletting to a new tenant, including any repairs or alterations; and (iv) reletting the Premises, including brokers’ commissions.</p>
          <p id="s1p534">“The worth at the time of the award” as used in subsections (a) and (b) above is to be computed by allowing interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. “The worth at the time of the award” as used in subsection (c) above is to be computed by discounting the amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank situated nearest to the Premises at the time of the award plus one percent (1%).</p>

Tenant agrees that it will abide by, keep and observe all reasonable rules and regulations which Landlord may make from time to time for the management, safety, care, and cleanliness of the Building and grounds, the parking of vehicles and the preservation of good order herein as well as for the convenience of other occupants and tenants of the Building.

Tenant shall at any time upon not less than ten (10) days’ prior written notice from Landlord execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord a statement in writing certifying (1) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease, as so modified, is in full force and effect), the amount of any security deposit, and the date to which the rent and other charges are paid in advance, if any; and (2) acknowledging that there are not, to Tenant’s knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of Landlord hereunder, or specifying such defaults if any are claimed. Any such statement may be conclusively relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer to the Premises. At Landlord’s option, Tenant’s failure to deliver such statement within such time shall be a material breach of this Lease or shall be conclusive upon Tenant that (1) this Lease is in full force and effect, without modification except as may be represented by Landlord, (2) there are no uncured defaults in Landlord’s performance, and (3) not more than one month’s rent has been paid in advance or such failure maybe considered by Landlord as a default by Tenant under this Lease. If Landlord desires to finance, refinance, or sell the Premises, or any part thereof, Tenant hereby agrees to deliver to any lender or purchaser designated by Landlord such financial statements of Tenant as may be reasonably required by such lender or purchaser. Such statements shall include the past three years’ financial statements of Tenant. All such financial statements shall be received by Landlord and such lender or purchaser in confidence and shall be used only for the purposes herein set forth.</p>
          <p id="s1p554">25 ARBITRATION. In the event of any dispute between Landlord and Tenant arising under this Lease that is not resolved by the parties within ten (10) days after the date either party gives notice to the other of its desire to arbitrate the dispute (the “Outside Agreement Date”), the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration as provided in this § 25 and under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect; provided, however, that nothing in this § 25 shall limit Landlord’s right to bring an unlawful detainer action against Tenant if appropriate. All arbitration proceedings shall be conducted at Berkeley, California. Judgement upon the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrators shall have no power to change the Lease provisions. Both parties shall continue performing their Lease obligations pending the award in the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrators shall award the prevailing party reasonable expenses and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to § 25.3 below, plus interest on the amount due at eighteen percent (18%) per annum or the maximum then allowed by Law, whichever is less.</p>
          <p id="s1p555">25.1 Procedure. Not later than fifteen (15) days following the Outside Agreement Date, Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint one arbitrator who shall be a real estate professional who shall have been active over the five (5) year period ending on the date of such appointment in the appraisal and/or leasing of commercial properties in the vicinity of the Building, The two arbitrators so appointed shall within fifteen (15) days of the date of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same criteria set forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial two arbitrators. Within three (3) business days following the appointment of the third arbitrator, each party shall submit to the arbitrators its best estimate of the correct solution to the dispute under submission (the “Estimated Determination”). The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s Estimated Determination of the dispute under arbitration is closer to the arbitrators’ independent determination of the dispute, taking into account any definitions or other sections of the Lease which may be applicable to the dispute. The three arbitrators shall within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the third arbitrator reach a decision as to whether the parties shall use Landlord’s or Tenant’s Estimated Determination and shall notify Landlord and Tenant thereof. The decision of the majority of the three arbitrators shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p556">25.2 Failure to Agree. If either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the Outside Agreement Date, or if the two arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, both arbitrators shall be dismissed; and the matter to be decided shall be forthwith submitted to arbitration under the current rules of the American Arbitration Association, but subject to any definitions or sections of the Lease which may be applicable to the dispute under submission.</p>

If payment is not made within ten (10) business days after the date the arbitration award is no longer appealable, then in addition to any remedies under the law, if Landlord is the prevailing party, it shall have the same remedies for failure to pay the arbitration award as it has for Tenant’s failure to pay Rent; and if Tenant is the prevailing party, it may deduct any remaining award from its monthly payment of Rent or other charges.</p>
          <p id="s1p562">26 SUBORDINATION. Tenant agrees that this Lease shall be automatically subordinate to any mortgage or trust deeds that are now or may hereafter be placed upon said Premises.

          <p id="s1p563">27 LANDLORD’S LIABILITY. The liability of Landlord to Tenant for any default by Landlord under this Lease or arising in connection herewith or with Landlord’s operation, management, leasing, repair, renovation, alteration, or any other matter relating to the Building or the Premises shall be limited to the interest of Landlord in the Building (and the rental proceeds thereof). Under no circumstances shall Landlord ever be liable for consequential or punitive damages, including damages for lost profits or for business interruption. Tenant agrees to look solely to Landlord’s interest in the Building (and the rental proceeds thereof) for the recovery of any judgement against Landlord, and Landlord shall not be personally liable for any such judgement or deficiency after execution thereon. The limitations of liability contained in this § 27 shall apply equally and inure to the benefit of Landlord’s present and future partners, beneficiaries, officers, directors, trustees, shareholders, agents, and employees, and their respective partners, heirs, successors, and assigns. Under no circumstances shall any present or future general or limited partner of Landlord (if Landlord is a partnership), or trustee or beneficiary (if Landlord or any partner of Landlord is a trust) have any liability for the performance of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease.</p>

The term Landlord as used herein shall mean only the owner or owners, at the time in question, of the fee title of leased Premises and in the event of any transfer of such title or interest, Landlord herein named shall be relieved from and after the date of such transfer of all liability as respects Landlord’s obligations thereafter to be performed, provided that any funds in the hands of Landlord at the time of such transfer, in which Tenant has an interest, shall be delivered to the grantee. The obligations contained in this Lease to be performed by Landlord shall, subject as aforesaid, be binding on Landlord’s successors and assigns, only during their respective periods of ownership.</p>
          <p id="s1p565">28 MISCELLANEOUS. The following provisions shall apply generally to terms, provisions, and covenants of this Lease:</p>
          <p id="s1p566">28.1 No Offer. The submission of this document for examination and negotiation does not constitute an offer to lease, or a reservation of, or option for, the Premises. This document becomes effective and binding only upon execution and delivery hereof by Tenant and by Landlord. No act or omission of any employee or agent of Landlord or of Landlord’s broker shall alter, change, or modify any of the provisions hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p567">28.2 No Partnership. It is expressly understood that Landlord does not, in any way or for any purpose, become a partner of Tenant in the conduct of its business, or otherwise, or joint adventurer or a member of a joint enterprise with Tenant, and that the provisions of this Lease relating to the percentage rental payable hereunder, if any, are included solely for the purpose of providing a method whereby the rental is to be measured and ascertained.</p>
