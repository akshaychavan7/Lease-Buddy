          <p id="s1p260">(1) If Tenant shall default in the payment of Fixed Rent, additional rent or other payments required of Tenant, and if Tenant shall fail to cure said default within ten (10) days after receipt of notice of said default from Landlord, or (2) if Tenant shall default in the performance or observance of any other agreement or condition on its part to be performed or observed and if Tenant shall fail to cure said default within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of said default from Landlord (but if longer than thirty (30) days shall be reasonably required to cure said default, then if Tenant shall fail to commence the curing of such default within thirty (30) days after receipt of said notice and diligently prosecute the curing thereof to completion), or (3) if any person shall levy upon, or take this leasehold interest or any part thereof upon execution, attachment or other process of law, or (4) if Tenant or Guarantor shall make an assignment of its property for the benefit of creditors, or (5) if Tenant or Guarantor shall be declared bankrupt or insolvent according to law, or (6) if any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings shall be commenced by or against Tenant or Guarantor, or (7) if a receiver, trustee or assignee shall be appointed for the whole or any part of Tenant’s or Guarantor’s property, then in any of said cases, Landlord lawfully may immediately, or at any time thereafter, and without any further notice or demand except as is set forth herein and as required by law, enter into and</p>

          <p id="s1p262">upon the demised premises or any part thereof in the name of the whole, and hold the demised premises as if this lease had not been made, and expel Tenant and those claiming under it and remove its or their property without being taken or deemed to be guilty of any manner of trespass (or Landlord may send written notice to Tenant of the termination of this lease), and upon entry as aforesaid (or in the event that Landlord shall send Tenant notice of termination as above provided, on the fifth day next following the date of the sending of the notice), the term of this lease shall terminate. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (1) of the immediately preceding sentence, if Landlord shall have rightfully given Tenant notice of default pursuant to said clauses twice during any twelve (12) month period, and if Tenant shall thereafter in such twelve (12) month period default in the payment of Fixed Rent, additional rent or other payments required of Tenant, then Landlord may exercise the right of termination provided for it in said immediately preceding sentence without first giving Tenant notice of such default and the opportunity to cure the same within the time provided in said clause (1). Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant being evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or in the event Landlord terminates this lease as provided in this Article.</p>
          <p id="s1p263">(B) OBLIGATIONS THEREAFTER</p>
          <p id="s1p264">In case of any such termination, Tenant will indemnify Landlord each month against all loss of Fixed Rent and additional rent and against all obligations which Landlord may incur by reason of any such termination between the time of termination and the expiration of the Term. It is understood and agreed that at the time of the termination or at any time thereafter Landlord may rent the demised premises, and for a term which may expire before or after the expiration of the Term, without releasing Tenant from any liability whatsoever, that Tenant shall be liable for any expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with obtaining possession of the demised premises, with removing from the demised premises property of Tenant and persons claiming under it (including warehouse charges), with putting the demised premises into good condition for reletting, and with any reletting, including, but without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and brokers fees, and that any monies collected from any reletting shall be applied first to the foregoing expenses and then to the payment of Fixed Rent, additional rent and all other payments due from Tenant to Landlord.</p>

          <p id="s1p266">CASUALTY AND TAKING</p>
          <p id="s1p267">8. (A) CASUALTY AND TAKING</p>
          <p id="s1p268">In case during the Term all or any substantial part of the demised premises, the buildings, or Lot or any one or more of them, are damaged by fire or any other casualty or by action of public or other authority or are taken by eminent domain, this lease shall terminate at Landlord’s election, which may be made notwithstanding Landlord’s entire interest may have been divested, by notice given to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the event giving rise to the election to terminate. Said notice shall, in the case of damage as aforesaid, specify the effective date of termination which shall be not less than thirty nor more than sixty days after the date of notice of such termination. In the case of any such taking by eminent domain, the effective date of the termination shall be the day on which the taking authority shall take</p>
          <p id="s1p269">15</p>
          <p id="s1p270">possession of the taken property. Fixed Rent and additional rent shall be apportioned and adjusted as of the effective date of any such termination. If in any such case the demised premises are rendered unfit for use and occupation and this lease is not so terminated, Landlord shall use due diligence to put the demised premises, or, in the case of a taking, what may remain thereof (excluding any items which Tenant may be required or permitted to remove, from the demised premises at the expiration of the Term) into proper condition for use and occupation, but Landlord shall not be required to spend more than the net proceeds of insurance or award of damages it receives therefor, and a just proportion of the Fixed Rent and additional rent according to the nature and extent of the injury to the demised premises shall be abated until the demised premises or such remainder shall have been put by Landlord in such condition; and in case of a taking which permanently reduces the area of the demised premises, a just proportion of the Fixed Rent shall be abated for the remainder of the Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that there is a fire or other casualty or a taking by eminent domain or by action of public or other authority, Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days of such event, make a good faith estimate of the anticipated restoration time. If pursuant to such estimate the damage to the base buildings or the Lot cannot be repaired and restored to substantially the same dimensions as prior to the casualty and as reasonably required for Tenant to conduct its business within eighteen (I8) months from the occurrence of the same, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this lease by notice to this effect given to Landlord within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord’s determination as aforesaid, and which termination shall be effective on the tenth (10th) day following the receipt by Landlord of said termination notice. If this lease shall not be terminated, as aforesaid, Landlord shall promptly commence to rebuild same provided, however, that if the buildings or Lot are not so restored within said eighteen (18) months, then Tenant shall have the right, as Tenant’s sole remedy, to terminate this lease at any time thereafter but prior to the completion of the restoration. Further, if any such fire or other casualty or taking by eminent domain or by action of public or other authority occurs during the last two (2) years of the Term of this lease, and the demised premises are damaged or destroyed as a result thereof to the extent of fifteen percent (15%) or more of its insurable value, or if the square foot floor area of the demised premises are reduced by such taking during the last two (2) years of the Term by more than fifteen percent (15%), then Landlord and Tenant shall have the right to terminate this lease, by written notice given to the other party within thirty (30) days after the casualty or taking, and which termination shall, be effective on the tenth (10th) day following the delivery of said termination notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p271">(B) RESERVATION OF AWARD</p>
          <p id="s1p272">Landlord reserves to itself any and all rights to receive awards made for damage to the demised premises, buildings or Lot and the leasehold hereby created, or any one or more of them, accruing by reason of any exercise of the right of eminent domain or by reason of anything done in pursuance of public or other authority. Tenant hereby releases and assigns to Landlord all of Tenant’s rights to such awards, and covenants to deliver such further assignments and assurances thereof as Landlord may from time to time request. It is agreed and understood, however, that Landlord does not reserve to itself, and Tenant does not assign to Landlord, any damages payable for (i) movable equipment, trade fixtures, leasehold improvements, alterations and additions made by Tenant at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, and personal property installed by Tenant or anybody claiming under Tenant at its own expense or (ii) relocation expenses, but in each case only if and to the extent that such damages are recoverable by Tenant from such authority in a separate action and without reducing Landlord’s award of damages.</p>

          <p id="s1p276">9. (A) SUBORDINATION TO MORTGAGES</p>
          <p id="s1p277">It is agreed that the rights and interest of Tenant under this lease shall be: (i) subject and subordinate to the lien of any present or future first mortgage and to any and all advances to be made thereunder, and to the interest thereon, upon the demised premises or any property of which the demised premises are a part, if the holder of such mortgage shall elect, by notice to Tenant, to subject and subordinate the rights and interest of Tenant under this lease to the lien of its mortgage; or (ii) prior to the lien of any present or future first mortgage, if the holder of such mortgage shall elect, by notice to Tenant, to give the rights and interest of Tenant under this lease priority to the lien of its mortgage. In the event of any of such elections, and upon notification by the holder of such mortgage to that effect, the rights and interest of Tenant under this lease shall be deemed to be subordinate to, or to have priority over, as the case may be, the lien of said mortgage, irrespective of the time of execution or time of recording of any such mortgage. Tenant agrees that it will, upon request of Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all reasonable instruments deemed by Landlord necessary or desirable to evidence or to give notice of such subordination or priority and reasonably acceptable to Tenant. The word “mortgage” as used herein includes mortgages, deeds of trust or other similar instruments and modifications, consolidations, extensions, renewals, replacements and substitutes thereof. Whether the lien of any mortgage upon the demised premises or any property of which the demised premises are a part shall be superior or subordinate to this lease and the lien hereof, Tenant agrees that it will, upon request, attorn to the holder of such mortgage or anyone claiming under such holder and their respective successors and assigns in the event of foreclosure of or similar action taken under such mortgage. Tenant further agrees that it shall not subordinate its interest in this lease to the lien of any junior mortgage, security agreement or lease affecting the demised premises, unless the holder of the first mortgage upon the demised premises or property which includes the demised premises shall consent thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 9, Tenant shall not be required to subordinate this lease and the lien hereof to the lien of any mortgage unless the holder of such mortgage shall enter into an agreement with Tenant, in a form reasonably acceptable to Tenant, recordable in form, to the effect that in the event of foreclosure of, or similar action taken under, such mortgage, all of the terms and conditions of this lease shall remain in effect and Tenant’s possession of the demised premises shall not be terminated or disturbed by such mortgage holder or anyone claiming under such mortgage holder so long as Tenant shall not be in default under this lease beyond any applicable cure period. Landlord shall obtain such an agreement from the present mortgagee of the Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p278">(B) LIMITATION ON MORTGAGEE’S LIABILITY</p>
          <p id="s1p279">Upon entry and taking possession of the mortgaged premises for any purpose, the holder of a mortgage shall have all rights of Landlord, and during the period of such possession Landlord, not such mortgage holder, shall have the duty to perform all of Landlord’s obligations</p>
          <p id="s1p280">17</p>
          <p id="s1p281">hereunder. No such holder shall be liable, either as a mortgagee or as holder of a collateral assignment of this lease, to perform, or be liable in damages for failure to perform, any of the obligations of Landlord unless and until such holder shall succeed to Landlord’s interest herein through foreclosure of its mortgage or the taking of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and thereafter such mortgage holder shall not be liable for the performance of any of Landlord’s obligations hereunder, except for the performance of those obligations which arise during the period of time that such mortgage holder holds Landlord’s right, title and interest in this lease or which arose prior thereto and are of a continuing nature, such liability to be limited to the same extent as Landlord’s liability is limited pursuant to Section 10(E) hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p282">(C) NO RELEASE OR TERMINATION</p>
          <p id="s1p283">No act or failure to act on the part of Landlord which would entitle Tenant under the terms of this lease, or by law, to be relieved of any of Tenant’s obligations hereunder or to terminate this lease, shall result in a release or termination of such obligations or a termination of this lease unless (i) Tenant shall have first given written notice of Landlord’s act or failure to act to Landlord’s mortgagees of record, provided Tenant has received written notice of such mortgagee, if any, specifying the act or failure to act on the part of Landlord which could or would be the basis of Tenant’s rights and (ii) such mortgagees, after receipt of such notice, have failed or refused to correct or cure the condition complained of within the same time thereafter as allowed by Landlord, but nothing contained in this Section (C) shall be deemed to impose any obligation on any such mortgagee to correct or cure any such condition. Finally, Tenant agrees that so long as any present or future mortgage shall remain in effect Tenant shall not alter, modify, amend, change, surrender or cancel this lease nor pay the rent due hereunder in advance for more than thirty (30) days, except as may be required herein, without the prior written consent of the holder thereof, and Tenant will not seek to be made an adverse or defendant party in any action or proceeding brought to enforce or foreclose such mortgage.</p>

          <p id="s1p289">Upon request of either party both parties shall execute and deliver a short form of this lease in form appropriate for recording, and if this lease is terminated before the Term expires, an instrument in such form acknowledging the date of termination.

          <p id="s1p294">All notices and other communications authorized or required hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by mailing the same by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, by mailing the same by Express Mail or by having the same delivered by a commercial delivery service such as Federal Express, UPS, Purolator Courier and the like. If given to Tenant the same shall be directed to Tenant at 64 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 42139, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, or to such other person or at such other address as Tenant may hereafter designate by notice to Landlord; and if given to Landlord the same shall be directed to Landlord at Landlord’s Address, or to such other person or at such other address as Landlord may hereafter designate by notice to Tenant. In the event the notice directed as above provided shall not be received upon attempted delivery thereof to the proper address and shall be returned by the Postal Service or delivery service to the sender because of a refusal of receipt, the absence of a person to receive, or otherwise, the time of the giving of such notice shall be the first business day on which delivery was so attempted.</p>
          <p id="s1p295">After receiving notice from Landlord or from any person, firm or other entity that such person, firm or other entity holds a mortgage which includes the demised premises as part of the mortgaged premises, no notice from Tenant to Landlord shall be effective unless and until a copy of the same is given by certified or registered mail to such holder, and the curing of any of Landlord’s defaults by such holder shall be treated as performance by Landlord, it being understood and agreed that such holder shall be afforded the same period of time after the receipt of such notice as Landlord has in which to effect such cure.</p>
          <p id="s1p296">(E) SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS</p>
          <p id="s1p297">The obligations of this lease shall run with the land, and this lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, except that the Landlord named herein and each successive owner of Landlord’s interest in this lease shall be liable only for the obligations of Landlord accruing during the period of its ownership. Whenever Landlord’s interest in this lease is owned by a trustee or trustees, the obligations of Landlord shall be binding upon Landlord’s trust estate, but not upon any trustee, beneficiary or shareholder of the trust individually. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and whether or not Landlord’s interest in this lease is owned by a trustee or trustees, Tenant specifically agrees to look solely to Landlord’s interest in the buildings and Lot (including any consideration received as part of a transfer of the Property and insurance proceeds and condemnation awards) for recovery of any judgment from Landlord, it being specifically agreed that neither Landlord, any trustee, beneficiary or shareholder of any trust estate for which Landlord acts nor any person or entity claiming by, through or under Landlord shall ever otherwise be personally liable for any such judgment. The foregoing shall not limit any injunctive relief to which Tenant may be entitled.</p>
          <p id="s1p298">(F) NO SURRENDER</p>
          <p id="s1p299">The delivery of keys to any employee of Landlord or to Landlord’s agent or any employee thereof shall not operate as a termination of this lease or a surrender of the demised premises.</p>

          <p id="s1p301">(G) WAIVERS AND REMEDIES</p>
          <p id="s1p302">The failure of Landlord or of Tenant to seek redress for violation of, or to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant or condition of this lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such violation nor prevent a subsequent act, which would have originally constituted a violation, from having all the force and effect of an original violation. The receipt by Landlord of Fixed Rent or additional rent with knowledge of the breach of any covenant of this lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach by Landlord unless such waiver be in writing signed by Landlord. No consent or waiver express or implied, by Landlord or Tenant to or of any breach of any agreement or duty shall be construed as a waiver or consent to or of any other breach of the same or any other agreement or duty. No acceptance by Landlord of a lesser sum than the Fixed Rent and additional rent then due shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest installment of such rent due nor shall acceptance by Tenant of any lesser sum that may be due Tenant from Landlord be deemed to be other than on account of the full amount due, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as rent be deemed as accord and satisfaction, and Landlord or Tenant, may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord’s or Tenant’s right to recover the balance of such installment or pursue any other remedy available to it. The specific remedies to which Landlord or Tenant may resort under the terms of this lease are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other remedies or means of redress to which it may be lawfully entitled in case of any breach or threatened breach by Tenant or Landlord of any provisions of this lease. In addition to the other remedies provided in this lease, Landlord and Tenant shall be entitled to the restraint by injunction of the violation or attempted or threatened violation of any of the covenants, conditions or provisions of this lease or to a decree compelling specific performance of any such covenants, conditions or provisions. If any term of this lease, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be held, to any extent, to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this lease, or the application of such term to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term of this lease shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. If any interest to be paid by Tenant hereunder shall exceed the highest lawful rate which Landlord may recover from Tenant, such interest shall be reduced to such highest lawful rate of interest.</p>
          <p id="s1p303">(H) SELF-HELP</p>
          <p id="s1p304">If Tenant shall at any time default in the performance of any obligation under this lease, Landlord shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to enter upon the demised premises and to perform such obligation, notwithstanding the fact that no specific provision for such performance by Landlord is made in this lease with respect to such default. In performing such obligation, Landlord may make any payment of money or perform any other act. All sums so paid by Landlord (together with interest, from the time paid by Landlord until the time Tenant repays the same to Landlord at the Default Rate set forth in Section (A) of Article V above), shall be deemed to be additional rent and shall be payable to Landlord immediately on demand. Landlord may exercise the foregoing right without waiving any other of its rights or releasing Tenant from any of its obligations under this lease. If Landlord shall at any time default in the performance of any obligation under this lease, Tenant shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to enter upon the demised premises and to perform such obligation, notwithstanding</p>

          <p id="s1p306">the fact that no specific provision for such performance by Tenant is made in this lease with respect to such default. In performing such obligation, Tenant may make any payment of money or perform any other act. All sums so paid by Tenant (together with interest, from the time paid by Tenant until the time Landlord repays the same to Tenant, Default Rate set forth in Section (A) of Article V above), shall be payable to Tenant immediately on demand. Tenant may exercise the foregoing right without waiving any other of its rights or releasing Landlord from any of its obligations under this lease. If Landlord shall not reimburse Tenant within thirty (30) days of Tenant’s demand, Tenant may set off such sums from fifty percent (50%) of the monthly Fixed Rent payable by Tenant thereafter.</p>
          <p id="s1p307">(I) ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE</p>

Any such statement delivered pursuant to this Section (I) may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or mortgagee of premises which include the demised premises or any prospective assignee of any such mortgagee. Landlord shall upon not less than ten (10) business days prior written request of Tenant deliver to Tenant a similar statement as requested herein.</p>

          <p id="s1p315">against, all loss or damage (including without limitation, the cost of defending the same) arising from any claim by any broker other than the Listed Brokers, claiming to have dealt with Tenant.

          <p id="s1p317">Landlord shall not be deemed to have committed a breach of any obligation to make repairs or alterations or perform any other act unless: (1) it shall have made such repairs or alterations or performed such other act negligently; or (2) it shall have received notice from Tenant designating the particular repairs or alterations needed or the other act of which there has been failure of performance and shall have failed to make such repairs or alterations or performed such other act within a thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice (provided, however that if it shall reasonably require longer than thirty (30) days, then such longer period provided Landlord commences such curing within said thirty (30) days and prosecutes same to completion with due diligence); and in the latter event Landlord’s liability shall be limited to the cost of making such repairs or alterations or performing such other act. Tenant may, following such thirty (30) day (or longer) period make such repairs or perform such act and Tenant may set off the costs thereof from fifty percent (50%) of the monthly Fixed Rent payable by Tenant thereafter. The foregoing shall not limit any injunctive relief to which Tenant may be entitled.</p>
          <p id="s1p318">(M) EFFECTIVENESS OF LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p319">The submission of this lease for examination does not constitute a reservation of, or option for, the demised premises, and this lease becomes effective as a lease only upon execution and unconditional delivery thereof by both Landlord and Tenant.</p>

          <p id="s1p321">Tenant shall not (either with or without negligence) cause or permit the escape, disposal or release of any biologically or chemically active or other hazardous substances, or materials. Tenant shall not allow the storage or use of such substances or materials in any manner not sanctioned by the applicable permits, or by law or by the highest standards prevailing in the industry for the storage and use of such substances or materials, nor allow to be brought into the Lot any such materials or substances except to use in the ordinary course of Tenant’s business, and then only after written notice is given to Landlord of the identity of such substances or materials. Tenant shall obtain and maintain all proper permits required by applicable law or ordinance for the storage and use of hazardous materials, and Tenant shall furnish evidence of same upon request. Without limitation, hazardous substances and materials shall include those described in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901 at seq., any applicable state or local laws and the</p>
          <p id="s1p322">22</p>
          <p id="s1p323">regulations adopted under these acts. If any lender or governmental agency shall ever require testing to ascertain whether or not there has been any release of hazardous materials, and if it is determined that there has been a release of hazardous materials attributable to Tenant, then the reasonable costs thereof shall be reimbursed by Tenant to Landlord upon demand as additional rent. In addition, Tenant shall execute affidavits, representations and the like from time to time at Landlord’s request concerning Tenant’s best knowledge and belief regarding the presence of hazardous substances or materials on the demised premises. In all events, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord in the manner elsewhere provided in this lease from any release of hazardous materials on the demised premises occurring while Tenant is in possession or elsewhere if caused by Tenant or persons acting under Tenant. The within covenants shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term of this lease. Landlord acknowledges that Tenant may use and store certain hazardous materials provided Tenant uses, stores and removes same in accordance with all applicable laws. Tenant shall in all events remove any such hazardous materials upon the expiration of the Term of this lease. Landlord shall have the right, at reasonable times and upon prior reasonable notice (but in any event not less than 48 hours prior notice), to inspect the demised premises to determine the use, storage and removal of such hazardous materials. Upon request, Tenant shall give Landlord a list of the hazardous materials used, stored and removed from the demised premises. Notwithstanding any provision of this lease to the contrary, Landlord shall solely be responsible for the remediation (or to cause such removal or remediation) and all costs thereof to the extent required by and in compliance with all legal requirements of any hazardous material present in, on or under the demised premises existing prior to the date Landlord delivers the demised premises to Tenant, whether now known or discovered hereafter, or to the extent caused by Landlord, or its servants or agents. Landlord shall indemnify and hold Tenant harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, penalties, fines and costs arising directly out of any condition caused or created by Landlord’s failure to comply with its obligations under this Section. The foregoing indemnification of Tenant by Landlord includes, without limitation, all costs incurred by or imposed upon Tenant in connection with any judgments, damages, penalties, fines, liabilities or losses (including, without limitation, sums paid in settlement of claims, reasonable attorneys’ fees, consultant fees and expert fees).

          <p id="s1p336">Tenant shall have the right, at its election, to extend the Original Term of this lease for an additional period of five (5) years commencing upon the expiration of the Original Term, provided that Landlord shall receive written notice from Tenant of the exercise of its election at least nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term and provided further that Tenant shall not be in default beyond any applicable cure period at the time of Landlord’s receipt of such notice in the payment of any Fixed Rent due Landlord by Tenant. Tenant shall have the right, at its election, to further extend the Original Term as previously extended for one (1) additional period of five (5) years commencing upon the expiration of the Original Term as previously extended, provided that Landlord shall receive written notice from Tenant of the exercise of its election at least nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the Original Term as previously extended and provided further that Tenant shall not be in default beyond any applicable cure period at the time of Landlord’s receipt of such notice in the payment of any Fixed Rent due Landlord by Tenant. The expression “the original term” means the period of fifteen (15) years referred to in Section (A) of Article 1 of this lease. Prior to the exercise by Tenant of either of said elections to extend the Original Term, the expression “the term of this lease” or any equivalent expression shall mean the Original Term; after the exercise by Tenant of one or both of the aforesaid elections, the expression “the term of this lease” or any equivalent expression shall mean the Original Term as it may have been then extended. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this lease, all the agreements and conditions in this lease contained shall apply to the additional period or periods to which the Original Term shall be extended as aforesaid. If Landlord shall receive notice of the exercise of an election in the manner and within the time provided aforesaid, the Term shall be extended upon the receipt of the notice without the requirement of any action on the part of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p337">(B) OPTION RENT</p>
          <p id="s1p338">During each of the additional periods for which the Original Term of this lease may be extended as set forth in Section (A) of this Article XIII above, the Fixed Rent payable hereunder shall be adjusted so as to equal the greater of (a) the Fixed Rent payable immediately prior thereto, or (b) the “fair market rent”, as mutually determined by Landlord and Tenant through the process of negotiation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, however, if for any reason whatsoever Landlord and Tenant shall not agree in writing upon the “fair market rent” for the additional period in question at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the</p>
          <p id="s1p339">24</p>
          <p id="s1p340">Original Term, or the first additional period, as the case may be, then the fair market rent for premises of the size and nature of the demised premises shall be determined by licensed real estate appraisers having at least ten (10) years’ experience in the appraisal of commercial real estate in Greater Boston, Massachusetts, one such appraiser to be designated by each of Landlord and Tenant. If either party shall fail to designate its appraiser by giving notice of the name of such appraiser to the other party within fifteen (15) days after receiving notice of the name of the other party’s appraiser, then the appraiser chosen by the other party shall determine the fair market rent and his determination shall be final and conclusive. If the appraisers designated by Landlord and Tenant shall disagree as to the fair market rent, but if the difference between their estimates of fair market rent shall be five percent (5%) or less of the greater of the estimates, then the average of their estimates shall be the fair market rent for purposes hereof. If the appraisers designated by Landlord and Tenant shall disagree as to the amount of fair market rent, and if their estimates of fair market rent shall vary by more than five percent (5%) of the greater of said estimates, then they shall jointly select a third appraiser meeting the qualifications set forth above, and his estimate of fair market rent shall be the fair market rent for purposes hereof if it is not greater than the greater of the other two estimates and not less than the lesser of the other two estimates. If said third appraiser’s estimate is greater than the greater of the other two estimates, then the greater of the other two estimates shall be the fair market rent for purposes hereof; and if the estimate of the third appraiser shall be less than the lesser of the other two estimates, then the lesser of the other two estimates shall be the fair market rent for purposes hereof. Each of Landlord and Tenant shall pay for the services of its appraiser, and if a third appraiser shall be chosen, then each of Landlord and Tenant shall pay for one-half of the services of the third appraiser. In determining fair market rent, any improvements made by Tenant in the demised premises and not otherwise reimbursed by Landlord shall not be considered, such that the appraisal shall be based on the condition of the demised premises as same existed on the delivery date as improved by Landlord’s Construction Contribution.</p>
