          <p id="s1p30">11. Indemnity and Insurance.</p>
          <p id="s1p31">11.1. Indemnity. Joint Entity shall defend, indemnify and save NutraCea harmless from any and all claims brought by or on behalf of any third party relating to Joint Entity’s use of the Equipment, including but not limited to strict products liability, negligent acts or omissions of Joint Entity or any of its agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Joint Entity will not be required to indemnify and hold NutraCea harmless for any claims made against NutraCea relating to the ownership of the Equipment, claims alleging infringement of the Equipment on such third party’s rights, or claims arising primarily from any improper acts by NutraCea or its agents. NutraCea shall indemnify and save Joint Entity harmless from any and all third party claims made against Joint Entity alleging infringement of the Equipment on such third party’s rights, except to the extent arising primarily from any improper acts by Joint Entity.</p>
          <p id="s1p32">11.2. Insurance.

          <p id="s1p33">12. Confidentiality.</p>
          <p id="s1p34">12.1. Definition. “Confidential Information” means any information or compilation of information which is disclosed by one party hereto (“Disclosing Party”) to another party (“Receiving Party”) hereunder, which is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and which relates to technical specifications of the Equipment, the design, functionality and operations of the Equipment, trade secrets and information contained in or relating to product designs, manufacturing methods, processes, techniques, tooling, and maintenance procedures. Information shall be treated as Confidential Information irrespective of its source and all information which the Disclosing Party identifies as being “confidential” or “trade secret” shall be presumed to be Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the above, the term Confidential Information shall not include information:</p>
          <p id="s1p35">(a) which was in the public domain at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party;</p>
          <p id="s1p36">(b) which is published or otherwise comes into the public domain after its disclosure to the Receiving Party through no violation of this Lease, by the Receiving Party;</p>
          <p id="s1p37">(c) which is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party not under an obligation of confidence;</p>
          <p id="s1p38">(d) which is already known by the Receiving Party at the time of its disclosure to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party as evidenced by written documentation of the Receiving Party existing prior to such disclosure;</p>
          <p id="s1p39">(e) which is independently developed by the Receiving Party through persons who have not had, either directly or indirectly, access to or knowledge of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by written documentation of the Receiving Party; or</p>
          <p id="s1p40">(f) which is required to be disclosed by any law or governmental regulation or produced under order of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the Receiving Party provide the Disclosing Party written notice of such request or order and Disclosing Party is provided with an opportunity to attempt to limit such disclosure.</p>
          <p id="s1p41">12.2. Nondisclosure. During the term of this Lease and at all times thereafter, the Receiving Party agrees to hold in strictest confidence and to never disclose, furnish, communicate, make accessible to any person or use in any way for the Receiving Party’s own or another’s benefit any Confidential Information or permit the same to be used in competition with the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party agrees to use prudent and reasonable means to protect the Confidential Information.</p>
          <p id="s1p42">12.3. Injunctive Relief. In the event of any breach of this Section 8, the parties agree that the non-breaching party will suffer irreparable harm for which money damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, in addition to any other available remedies at law or in equity.</p>
          <p id="s1p43">13. Default; Effect of Termination.</p>
          <p id="s1p44">13.1 Default. Upon an Event of Default, this Lease shall terminate and all rights of Joint Entity to the Equipment shall immediately terminate. Upon an Event Default NutraCea shall be entitled to all remedies provided by law including the right to take possession of the Equipment, to retain all Rent previously paid, and to convey or lease the Equipment or portions thereof for such periods, at such rentals, and to such persons as NutraCea shall elect, and to recover from Joint Entity all damages and other recovery permitted under applicable law. An “Event of Default” shall mean, and be limited to, any of the following events:</p>
          <p id="s1p45">(a) The failure of Joint Entity to pay the Rent;</p>
          <p id="s1p46">(b) A default by Joint Entity in the performance of any of the material terms and conditions of this Lease that either is not capable of being cured or is not cured within 20 days after notice thereof is provided in writing to Joint Entity, and if such a default either materially and adversely affects NutraCea’s (x) legal title to the Equipment, (y) proprietary rights or intellectual property rights, or (z) ability to repossess the Equipment upon the expiration of this Lease. Except as set forth above, any other breach of this Lease shall not result in the return of the Equipment to NutraCea or the termination of this Lease, and shall only entitle NutraCea to seek monetary damages or injunctive relief.</p>
          <p id="s1p47">13.2. Effect of Termination. Upon expiration of the [*] Lease term or the termination of this Lease following and Event of Default, Joint Entity will return to NutraCea, and/or will provide evidence satisfactory to NutraCea of the destruction of all information or records evidencing or embodying any confidential information or intellectual proprietary rights of NutraCea, or with respect to the Equipment, and all copies, extracts, summaries and abstracts thereof, and thereafter will not use or disclose any such information or records for its own benefit or to the detriment of NutraCea.</p>
          <p id="s1p48">13.3. Removal of Equipment. Upon expiration of the [*] Lease term or the termination of this Lease following and Event of Default, NutraCea may, at its own expense, remove the Equipment from the Location, and shall repair any material damage to such premises as a result of such removal.</p>
          <p id="s1p49">13.4. Survival of Covenants. The obligations of the parties under Sections 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any expiration or termination of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p50">14. Dissolution of Joint Entity; Right of First Refusal.</p>
          <p id="s1p51">14.1 Buy Out Right.

During the 45 day period following NutraCea’s receipt of such written notice, NutraCea shall have the right to buy out Joint Entity’s rights under this Lease for an amount equal (the “Buy-Out Price”) to [*]. If NutraCea elects to buy out the Lease hereunder, NutraCea shall provide Joint Entity with a binding written notice of such election, which written notice shall also state NutraCea’s estimate of the Buy-Out Price. Joint Entity shall notify NutraCea within 15 days of its receipt of NutraCea’s estimate of the foregoing election whether it agrees with the Buy-Out Price. If Joint Entity does not agree with the Buy-Out Price, the Buy-Out Price shall be determined by an independent appraiser located in the United States and having an established reputation and selected by the mutual written consent of NutraCea and Joint Entity, which determination will be binding upon the parties absent fraud. The parties shall, within 15 days after the determination of Buy-Out Price consummate the termination of the Lease and the payment of the Buy-Out Price.</p>
          <p id="s1p52">14.2 Failure to Buy. If NutraCea does not elect to buy out the Lease under Section 14.1, notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, upon Joint Entity’s election to dissolve and wind up its operations, [*].</p>
          <p id="s1p53">15. Miscellaneous.</p>
