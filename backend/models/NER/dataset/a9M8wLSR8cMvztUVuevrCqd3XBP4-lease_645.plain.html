          <p id="s1p576">3.2.2If the formula set out in paragraph 3.1 produces an increase in the hypothetical rent that is greater than 3.25% (three and one quarter per cent) of the annual rent for the year preceding the relevant Anniversary the actual increase shall be substituted by the figure of 3.25%.</p>
          <p id="s1p577">3.3The Reviewed Rent payable from the Review Date is the amount calculated in respect of the Anniversary which coincides with the Review Date (capped or deemed as the case may be) described in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2.</p>
