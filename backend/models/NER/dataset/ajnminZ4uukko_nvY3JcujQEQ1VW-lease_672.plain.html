The inclusion of the preceding sentence shall not be construed as Landlord’s permission for Tenant to hold over.</p>
          <p id="s1p60">19. QUIET ENJOYMENT.</p>
          <p id="s1p61">Landlord represents and warrants that it has full rights and authority to enter into this Lease and that Tenant, upon paying the rental herein set forth and performing its other covenants and agreements herein set forth, shall peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises for the term hereof without hindrance or molestation from Landlord, subject to the terms and provisions of this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p65">B. If Tenant fails to perform or comply with any of the other terms, conditions and obligations of this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p70">21. REMEDIES.</p>
          <p id="s1p71">Upon the occurrence of any of such events of default described in Paragraph 20 hereof, Landlord shall have the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies without any notice or demand whatsoever:</p>
          <p id="s1p72">A. Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails so to do, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant</p>
          <p id="s1p73">and any other person who may be occupying the Premises or any part thereof, by force if necessary, without being liable for prosecution or any claim for damages therefore, and Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord on demand the amount of all loss and damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of such termination. In the event of termination of this Lease as aforesaid, Landlord may elect to recover from Tenant, as and for liquidated damages for loss of the bargain and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the difference between (1) the Base Rent, Tenant’s share of operating costs and other charges reserved hereunder for the period which otherwise should have been the balance of the term hereof; and (2) the fair rental value of the Premises for the balance of such term.</p>
          <p id="s1p74">B. Enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying the Premises or any part thereof, by force if necessary, without being liable for prosecution or any claim for damages therefore, all without terminating this Lease or any of Tenant’s obligations hereunder. In such event, Landlord may make alterations and repairs and redecorate the Premises to the extent deemed by Landlord necessary or desirable, and may relet the Premises, or any part thereof, for the account of Tenant, to any person, firm or corporation, other than Tenant, for such rent, for such time and upon such terms as Landlord in Landlord’s sole discretion, shall determine. In so doing, Landlord shall not be required to accept any tenant offered by Tenant or to observe any instruction given by Tenant concerning such reletting. Any rent and other amounts received by Landlord upon such reletting shall be applied first to the costs and expenses of Landlord in regaining possession of the Premises, storing property removed from the Premises, making alterations or repairs, redecorating the Premises and reletting the Premises including without limitation, brokerage and attorney’s fees and then such rent and other amounts shall be applied to the Base Rent, operating costs and other obligations of Tenant under this Lease, and Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord on demand any deficiency that may arise by reason of such reletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p75">C. Enter upon the Premises, by force if necessary, without being liable for prosecution or any claim for damages therefor, and do whatever Tenant is obligated to do under the terms of this Lease, and Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord on demand for any expenses which landlord may incur in this effecting compliance with Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, with interest as provided in Paragraph 26F hereof, and Tenant further agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for any damages resulting to Tenant from such action, whether caused by the negligence of Landlord or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p76">Pursuit of any of the foregoing remedies shall not preclude pursuit of any of the other remedies herein provided or any other remedies provided by law. Landlord may at any time elect to terminate this Lease as described in A above despite a prior election to exercise its remedies under B or C above. Pursuit of any remedy herein provided shall not constitute a forfeiture or waver of any rent due to Landlord hereunder or of any damages accruing to Landlord by reason of the violation of any of the terms, provisions and covenants herein contained. No waiver by Landlord of any violation or breach of any of the terms, provisions and covenants herein contained shall be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of any other violation or breach of any of</p>
          <p id="s1p77">the terms, provisions and covenants herein contained. Landlord’s acceptance of the payment of rental or other payments hereunder after the occurrence of an event of default shall not be construed as a waiver of such default unless Landlord so notifies Tenant in writing. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more of the remedies herein provided upon an event of default shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such default. If, on account of default by Tenant as described in Section 20, it becomes necessary or appropriate for Landlord to employ or consult with an attorney concerning or to enforce or defend any of Landlord’s rights or remedies hereunder, Tenant agrees to pay any reasonable attorneys’ fees and a management fee in the amount of Three Hundred and no/100 Dollars ($300.00). No act or thing done by Landlord or its agents during the term hereby granted shall be deemed an acceptance of the surrender of the Premises, and no agreement to accept a surrender of the Premises shall be valid unless in writing signed by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p78">22. LANDLORD’S RIGHT TO CURE.</p>
          <p id="s1p79">If Tenant defaults in the making of any payment or the doing of any act required to make such payment or do such act, and the costs incurred by Landlord in doing so, with interest thereon as provided in paragraph 26F hereof, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord upon demand. The making of such payment or the doing of such act by Landlord shall not operate to cure such default by Tenant or to prevent or stop Landlord from enforcing or pursuing any rights and remedies which Landlord would otherwise have.</p>
          <p id="s1p80">23. MORTGAGES.</p>
          <p id="s1p81">Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any mortgage(s) and/or deed(s) of trust and/or ground lease(s) or other underlying lease(s) now or at any time hereafter constituting a lien or charge upon the Premises, and Tenant shall at any time hereafter on demand execute any instruments, releases or other documents which may be required by any mortgagee, trustee or lessor for the purpose of subjecting and subordinating this Lease to the lien of any such mortgage, deed of trust, ground leases or other underlying lease. In the event Tenant fails to comply with any such demand within ten (10) days following the demand, Tenant shall be deemed to have appointed Landlord as Tenant’s attorney-in-fact to execute any such instruments, releases or other documents. With respect to any mortgage(s) and/or deed(s) of trust and/or ground lease(s) or other underlying lease(s) now or at any time hereafter created which constitute a lien or charge upon the Premises, Landlord at its sole option shall have the right to waive the applicability of this paragraph so that this Lease would not be subject and subordinate to such mortgage(s) or deed(s) of trust or ground lease(s) or other underlying lease(s).</p>
          <p id="s1p82">24. NOTICES.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">Each provision of this instrument or of any applicable law or regulation with reference to the sending, mailing or delivery of any notice or the making of any payment by Landlord or by Tenant to Landlord shall be deemed to be complied with when and if the following steps are taken:</p>
