A copy of Phase I of the Survey shall be forwarded to Tenant by Landlord within five (5) business days of Landlord’s receipt of the same, and copies shall be filed by Landlord with all governmental authorities or agencies whose regulations so require.</p>

In addition. Landlord shall contract for on-site air testing which, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the New York City Asbestos Control Program, must be conducted by a party prescribed by applicable law.

Landlord shall consider Tenant’s use and occupancy of the Demised Premises so as to minimize the negative impact of the ACM Work on Tenant’s operations in and use of the Building and the Demised Premises. In the event Tenant must vacate the Demised Premises or any portion thereof because the ACM Work, in the sole determination of Tenant, renders the Demised Premises unusable by Tenant, annual rent shall abate in the proportion that the portion of the Demised Premises which is vacated and/or rendered unusable bears to the entire Demised Premises for the period of time involved, provided it exceeds one full business day. Such abatement of rent shall continue until the Demised Premises or any portion thereof may be used for the purposes set forth in this Lease, as determined solely by Tenant, and Tenant certifies same in writing.</p>

Tenant shall not proceed with the ACM Work unless: (a) written notice shall first be given to Landlord specifying the manner in which Tenant claims such ACM Work has not been properly completed; and (b) Landlord shall have had thirty (30) days following receipt of such notice within which to complete said work.</p>
          <p id="s1p509">74</p>
          <p id="s1p510">(f) Following performance and completion of the ACM Work, Landlord shall, at its sole cost and expense, restore the Demised Premises to the condition that, in Tenant’s sole opinion, permits Tenant to use the Demised Premises for the purposes set forth in this Lease. Landlord shall be solely responsible for all repairs arising out of the performance of the ACM work. Landlord hereby agrees to save, hold harmless and indemnify Tenant, its employees, guests and invitees against any and all claims for bodily injury or property damage in connection with the ACM Work and work incidental thereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p511">(g) During the Term, Landlord shall, at its sole cost and expense, have the ACM monitored in the Demised Premises and the portions of the Building through which Tenant has access to the Demised Premises or which affect the Demised Premises pursuant to a plan approved by Tenant (the “Monitor Survey”) by a New York City Department of Environmental Protection certified asbestos investigator at least once every one hundred eighty (180) days from the Inspection, and Landlord shall immediately provide Tenant with a copy of the results of each such Monitor Survey. The Monitor Survey shall be in accordance with the principles set forth in the EPA Document “Managing Asbestos In Place” (the “Green Book”), as it may be subsequently revised or replaced by a similar text. If any such Monitor Survey should reveal that ACM has deteriorated, Landlord shall so notify Tenant in writing within five (5) days of the completion of such survey which notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such survey. Landlord shall within five (5) days from the completion of such Monitor Survey commence and diligently proceed to comply with continuity with the provisions of this Article with respect to abatement of any deteriorated ACM described in any such Monitor Survey.</p>

          <p id="s1p513">(h) The ACM Work must be performed by Landlord in accordance with Laws and Procedures and shall be done to the full satisfaction of Tenant. Upon completion of the ACM Work, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a certification of completion of same prepared by a New York City Department of Environmental Protection certified asbestos investigator. At such time, Tenant may re-inspect the premises to verify the accuracy of Landlord’s certification and advise Landlord if any further work needs to be done.</p>
