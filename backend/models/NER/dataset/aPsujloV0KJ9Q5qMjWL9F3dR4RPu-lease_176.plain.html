          <p id="s1p279">LEASE</p>
          <p id="s1p280">By this Lease Landlord leases to Tenant and Tenant leases from Landlord the Premises in the Building as set forth and described on the Reference Pages. The Premises are depicted on the floor plan attached hereto as Exhibit A, and the Building is depicted on the site plan attached hereto as Exhibit A-1. The Reference Pages, including all terms defined thereon, are incorporated as part of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p281">1. USE AND RESTRICTIONS ON USE.</p>
          <p id="s1p282">1.1 The Premises are to be used solely for the purposes set forth on the Reference Pages. Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done in or about the Premises which will in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other tenants or occupants of the Building or injure, annoy, or disturb them, or allow the Premises to be used for any improper, immoral, unlawful, or objectionable purpose, or commit any waste. Tenant shall not do, permit or suffer in, on, or about the Premises the sale of any alcoholic liquor without the written consent of Landlord first obtained. Tenant shall comply with all governmental laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to the use of the Premises and its occupancy and shall promptly comply with all governmental orders and directions for the correction, prevention and abatement of any violations in the Building or appurtenant land, caused or permitted by, or resulting from the specific use by, Tenant, or in or upon, or in connection with, the Premises, all at Tenant’s sole expense. Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done on or about the Premises or bring or keep anything into the Premises which will in any way increase the rate or, invalidate or prevent the procuring of any insurance protecting against loss or damage to the Building or any of its contents by fire or other casualty or against liability for damage to property or injury to persons in or about the Building or any part thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p283">1.2 Tenant shall not, and shall not direct, suffer or permit any of its agents, contractors, employees, licensees or invitees (collectively, the “Tenant Entities”) to at any time handle, use, manufacture, store or dispose of in or about the Premises or the Building any (collectively “Hazardous Materials”) flammables, explosives, radioactive materials, hazardous wastes or materials, toxic wastes or materials, or other similar substances, petroleum products or derivatives or any substance subject to regulation by or under any federal, state and local laws and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment or the keeping, use or disposition of environmentally hazardous materials, substances, or wastes, presently in effect or hereafter adopted, all amendments to any of them, and all rules and regulations issued pursuant to any of such laws or ordinances (collectively “Environmental Laws”), nor shal l Tenant suffer or permit any Hazardous Materials to be used in any manner not fully in compliance with all Environmental Laws, in the Premises or the Building and appurtenant land or allow the environment to become contaminated with any Hazardous Materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may handle, store, use or dispose of products containing small quantities of Hazardous Materials (such as aerosol cans containing insecticides, toner for copiers, paints, paint remover and the like) to the extent customary and necessary for the use of the Premises for general office purposes; provided that Tenant shall always handle, store, use, and dispose of any such Hazardous Materials in a safe and lawful manner and never allow such Hazardous Materials to contaminate the Premises, Building and appurtenant land or the environment. Tenant shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold each and all of the Landlord Entities (as defined in Article 30) harmless from and against any and all loss, claims, liability or costs ( including court costs and attorney’s fees) incurred by reason of any actual or asserted failure of Tenant to fully comply with all applicable Environmental Laws, or the presence, handling, use or disposition in or from the Premises of any Hazardous Materials by Tenant or any Tenant Entity (even though permissible under all applicable Environmental Laws or the provisions of this Lease), or by reason of any actual or asserted failure of Tenant to keep, observe, or perform any provision of this Section 1.2.</p>
          <p id="s1p284">1.3 Tenant and the Tenant Entities will be entitled to the non-exclusive use of the common areas of the Building as they exist from time to time during the Term, including the parking facilities, subject to Landlord’s rules and regulations regarding such use. However, in no event will Tenant or the Tenant Entities park more vehicles in the parking facilities than Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the total parking spaces available for common use. The foregoing shall not be deemed to provide Tenant with an exclusive right to any parking spaces or any guaranty of the availability of any particular parking spaces or any specific number of parking spaces.</p>
          <p id="s1p285">2. TERM.</p>
          <p id="s1p286">2.1 The Term of this Lease shall begin on the date (“Commencement Date”) which shall be the later of the Scheduled Commencement Date as shown on the Reference Pages and the date that Landlord shall tender possession of the Premises to Tenant, and shall terminate on the date as shown on the Reference Pages (“Termination Date”), unless sooner terminated by the provisions of this Lease. Landlord shall tender possession of the Premises with all the work, if any, to be performed by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit B to this Lease substantially completed. Tenant shall deliver a punch list of items not completed within thirty (30) days after Landlord tenders possession of the Premises and Landlord agrees to</p>
          <p id="s1p287">1</p>
          <p id="s1p288">proceed with due diligence to perform its obligations regarding such items. Tenant shall, at Landlord’s request, execute and deliver a memorandum agreement provided by Landlord in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto, setting forth the actual Commencement Date, Termination Date and, if necessary, a revised rent schedule. Should Tenant fail to do so within thirty (30) days after Landlord’s request, the information set forth in such memorandum provided by Landlord shall be conclusively presumed to be agreed and correct.</p>
          <p id="s1p289">2.2 Tenant agrees that in the event of the inability of Landlord to deliver possession of the Premises on the Scheduled Commencement Date for any reason, Landlord shall not be liable for any damage resulting from such inability, but Tenant shall not be liable for any rent until the time when Landlord can, after notice to Tenant, deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant. No such failure to give possession on the Scheduled Commencement Date shall affect the other obligations of Tenant under this Lease, except that if Landlord is unable to deliver possession of the Premises within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Scheduled Commencement Date (other than as a result of strikes, shortages of materials, holdover tenancies or similar matters beyond the reasonable control of Landlord and Tenant is notified by Landlord in writing as to such delay), Tenant shall have the option to terminate this Lease unless said delay is as a result of: (a) Tenant’s failure to agree to plans and specifications and/or construction cost estimates or bids; (b) Tenant’s request for materials, finishes or installations other than Landlord’s standard except those, if any, that Landlord shall have expressly agreed to furnish without extension of time agreed by Landlord; (c) Tenant’s change in any plans or specifications; or, (d) performance or completion by a party employed by Tenant (each of the foregoing, a “Tenant Delay”). If any delay is the result of a Tenant Delay, the Commencement Date and the payment of rent under this Lease shall be accelerated by the number of days of such Tenant Delay.</p>
          <p id="s1p290">2.3 In the event Landlord permits Tenant, or any agent, employee or contractor of Tenant, to enter, use or occupy the Premises prior to the Commencement Date, such entry, use or occupancy shall be subject to all the provisions of this Lease other than the payment of rent, including, without limitation, Tenant’s compliance with the insurance requirements of Article 11. Said early possession shall not advance the Termination Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p291">3. RENT.</p>
          <p id="s1p292">3.1 Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord the Annual Rent in effect from time to time by paying the Monthly Installment of Rent then in effect on or before the first day of each full calendar month during the Term, except that the first full month’s rent shall be paid upon the execution of this Lease. The Monthly Installment of Rent in effect at any time shall be one-twelfth (1/12) of the Annual Rent in effect at such time. Rent for any period during the Term which is less than a full month shall be a prorated portion of the Monthly Installment of Rent based upon the number of days in such month. Said rent shall be paid to Landlord, without deduction or offset and without notice or demand, at the Rent Payment Address, as set forth on the Reference Pages, or to such other person or at such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing. If an Event of Default occurs, Landl ord may require by notice to Tenant that all subsequent rent payments be made by an automatic payment from Tenant’s bank account to Landlord’s account, without cost to Landlord. Tenant must implement such automatic payment system prior to the next scheduled rent payment or within ten (10) days after Landlord’s notice, whichever is later. Unless specified in this Lease to the contrary, all amounts and sums payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this Lease shall be deemed additional rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p293">3.2 Tenant recognizes that late payment of any rent or other sum due under this Lease will result in administrative expense to Landlord, the extent of which additional expense is extremely difficult and economically impractical to ascertain. Tenant therefore agrees that if rent or any other sum is not paid when due and payable pursuant to this Lease, a late charge shall be imposed in an amount equal to the greater of: (a) Fifty Dollars ($50.00), or (b) six percent (6%) of the unpaid rent or other payment. The amount of the late charge to be paid by Tenant shall be reassessed and added to Tenant’s obligation for each successive month until paid. The provisions of this Section 3.2 in no way relieve Tenant of the obligation to pay rent or other payments on or before the date on which they are due, nor do the terms of this Section 3.2 in any way affect Landlord’s remedies pursuant to Article 19 of this Lease in the event said r ent or other payment is unpaid after date due.</p>
          <p id="s1p294">4. RENT ADJUSTMENTS.</p>
          <p id="s1p295">4.1 For the purpose of this Article 4, the following terms are defined as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p296">4.1.1 Lease Year: Each fiscal year (as determined by Landlord from time to time) falling partly or wholly within the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p297">2</p>
          <p id="s1p298">4.1.2 Expenses: All costs of operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and management of the Building (including the amount of any credits which Landlord may grant to particular tenants of the Building in lieu of providing any standard services or paying any standard costs described in this Section 4.1.2 for similar tenants), as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including the following costs by way of illustration, but not limitation: water and sewer charges; insurance charges of or relating to all insurance policies and endorsements deemed by Landlord to be reasonably necessary or desirable and relating in any manner to the protection, preservation, or operation of the Building or any part thereof; utility costs, including, but not limited to, the cost of heat, light, power, steam, gas; waste disposal; the cost of janitorial services; the cost of security and alarm services (including any central station signaling system); costs of cleaning, repairing, replacing and maintaining the common areas, including parking and landscaping, window cleaning costs; labor costs; costs and expenses of managing the Building including management and/or administrative fees; air conditioning maintenance costs; elevator maintenance fees and supplies; material costs; equipment costs including the cost of maintenance, repair and service agreements and rental and leasing costs; purchase costs of equipment; current rental and leasing costs of items which would be capital items if purchased; tool costs; licenses, permits and inspection fees; wages and salaries; employee benefits and payroll taxes; accounting and legal fees; any sales, use or service taxes incurred in connection therewith. In addition, Landlord shall be entitled to recover, as additional rent (which, along with any other capital expenditures constituting Expenses, Landlord may either include in Expenses or cause to be billed to Tenant along with Expenses and Taxes but as a separate item), Tenant’s Proportionate Share of: (i ) an allocable portion of the cost of capital improvement items which are reasonably calculated to reduce operating expenses; (ii) the cost of fire sprinklers and suppression systems and other life safety systems; and (iii) other capital expenses which are required under any governmental laws, regulations or ordinances which were not applicable to the Building at the time it was constructed; but the costs described in this sentence shall be amortized over the reasonable life of such expenditures in accordance with such reasonable life and amortization schedules as shall be determined by Landlord in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, with interest on the unamortized amount at one percent (1%) in excess of the Wall Street Journal prime lending rate announced from time to time. Expenses shall not include depreciation or amortization of the Building or equipment in the Building except as provided herein, loan principal payments, costs of alterations of tenants’ premises, leasing commi ssions, interest expenses on long-term borrowings or advertising costs.</p>
          <p id="s1p299">4.1.3 Taxes: Real estate taxes and any other taxes, charges and assessments which are levied with respect to the Building or the land appurtenant to the Building, or with respect to any improvements, fixtures and equipment or other property of Landlord, real or personal, located in the Building and used in connection with the operation of the Building and said land, any payments to any ground lessor in reimbursement of tax payments made by such lessor; and all fees, expenses and costs incurred by Landlord in investigating, protesting, contesting or in any Way seeking to reduce or avoid increase in any assessments, levies or the tax rate pertaining to any Taxes to be paid by Landlord in any Lease Year. Taxes shall not include any corporate franchise, or estate, inheritance or net income tax, or tax imposed upon any transfer by Landlord of its interest in this Lease or the Building or any taxes to be paid by Tenant pursuant to Article 28.</p>
          <p id="s1p300">4.2 If in any Lease Year, (i) Expenses paid or incurred shall exceed Expenses paid or incurred in the Base Year (Expenses) and/or (ii) Taxes paid or incurred by Landlord in any Lease Year shall exceed the amount of such Taxes which became due and payable in the Base Year (Taxes), Tenant shall pay as additional rent for such Lease Year Tenant’s Proportionate Share of such excess.</p>
          <p id="s1p301">4.3 The annual determination of Expenses shall be made by Landlord and shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant, subject to the provisions of this Section 4.3. During the Term, Tenant may review, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, the books and records supporting such determination in an office of Landlord, or Landlord’s agent, during normal business hours, upon giving Landlord five (5) days advance written notice within sixty (60) days after receipt of such determination, but in no event more often than once in any one (1) year period, subject to execution of a confidentiality agreement acceptable to Landlord, and provided that if Tenant utilizes an independent accountant to perform such review it shall be one of national standing which is reasonably acceptable to Landlord, is not compensated on a contingency basis and is also subject to such confidentiality agreement. If Tenant fails to object to Landlord’s determin ation of Expenses within ninety (90) days after receipt, or if any such objection fails to state with specificity the reason for the objection, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved such determination and shall have no further right to object to or contest such determination. If Tenant objects to Landlord’s determination of Expenses within ninety (90) days of receipt, then within fourteen (14) days after Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s objection. Landlord and Tenant shall each simultaneously submit to the other in a sealed envelope its good faith estimate of the Expenses that are due. If the higher of such estimates is not more than one hundred five percent (105%) of the lower, then the amount of Expenses shall be the average of the two. Otherwise the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with (i) and (ii) below. (i) Within seven (7) days after the exchange of estimates, the parties shall select as an arbitrator an independent certified</p>
          <p id="s1p302">3</p>
          <p id="s1p303">public accountant with at least five (5) years of experience in commercial real estate matters in the metropolitan area in which the Project is located (a “Qualified Accountant”). If the parties cannot agree on a Qualified Accountant, then within a second period of seven (7) days, each shall select a Qualified Accountant and within ten (10) days thereafter the two appointed Qualified Accountants shall select a third Qualified Accountant and the third Qualified Accountant shall be the sole arbitrator. If one party shall fail to select a Qualified Accountant within the second seven (7) day period, then the Qualified Accountant chosen by the other party shall be the sole arbitrator, (ii) Within twenty-one (21) days after submission of the matter to the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine the Expenses due from/credit due to Tenant by choosing whichever of the estimates submitted by Landlord and Tenant the arbitrator judges to be more accurate. The arbitrator shall notify Landl ord and Tenant of its decision, which shall be final and binding. If the arbitrator believes that expert advice would materially assist him, the arbitrator may retain one or more qualified persons to provide expert advice. The fees of the arbitrator and the expenses of the arbitration proceeding, including the fees of any expert witnesses retained by the arbitrator, shall be paid by the party whose estimate is not selected. Each party shall pay the fees of its respective counsel and the fees of any witness called by that party. In the event that during all or any portion of any Lease Year or Base Year, the Building is not fully rented and occupied Landlord shall make an appropriate adjustment in occupancy-related Expenses for such year for the purpose of avoiding distortion of the amount of such Expenses to be attributed to Tenant by reason of variation in total occupancy of the Building, by employing consistent and sound accounting and management principles to determine Expenses that would have been paid or incurred by Landlord had the Building been at least ninety-five percent (95%) rented and occupied, and the amount so determined shall be deemed to have been Expenses for such Lease Year.</p>
          <p id="s1p304">4.4 Prior to the actual determination thereof for a Lease Year, Landlord may from time to time estimate Tenant’s liability for Expenses and/or Taxes under Section 4.2, Article 6 and Article 28 for the Lease Year or portion thereof. Landlord will give Tenant written notification of the amount of such estimate and Tenant agrees that it will pay, by increase of its Monthly Installments of Rent due in such Lease Year, additional rent in the amount of such estimate. Any such increased rate of Monthly Installments of Rent pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall remain in effect until further written notification to Tenant pursuant hereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p305">4.5 When the above mentioned actual determination of Tenant’s liability for Expenses and/or Taxes is made for any Lease Year and when Tenant is so notified in writing, then:</p>
          <p id="s1p306">4.5.1 If the total additional rent Tenant actually paid pursuant to Section 4.3 on account of Expenses and/or Taxes for the Lease Year is less than Tenant’s liability for Expenses and/or Taxes, then Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord as additional rent in one lump sum within thirty (30) days of receipt of Landlord’s bill therefor; and</p>
          <p id="s1p307">4.5.2 If the total additional rent Tenant actually paid pursuant to Section 4.3 on account of Expenses and/or Taxes for the Lease Year is more than Tenant’s liability for Expenses and/or Taxes, then Landlord shall credit the difference against the then next due payments to be made by Tenant under this Article 4, or, if the Lease has terminated, refund the difference in cash. Tenant shall not be entitled to a credit by reason of actual Expenses and/or Taxes in any Lease Year being less than Expenses and/or Taxes in the Base Year (Expenses and/or Taxes).</p>
          <p id="s1p308">4.6 If the Commencement Date is other than January 1 or if the Termination Date is other than December 31, Tenant’s liability for Expenses and Taxes for the Lease Year in which said Date occurs shall be prorated based upon a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year.</p>
          <p id="s1p309">5. SECURITY DEPOSIT. Tenant shall deposit the Security Deposit with Landlord upon the execution of this Lease. Said sum shall be held by Landlord as security for the faithful performance by Tenant of all the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant and not as an advance rental deposit or as a measure of Landlord’s damage in case of Tenant’s default. If Tenant defaults with respect to any provision of this Lease, Landlord may use any part of the Security Deposit for the payment of any rent or any other sum in default, or for the payment of any amount which Landlord may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of Tenant’s default, or to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of Tenant’s default. If any portion is so used, Tenant shall within five (5) days after written demand therefor, deposit with Landlord an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its original amou nt and Tenant’s failure to do so shall be a material breach of this Lease. Except to such extent, if any, as shall be required by law, Landlord shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general funds, and Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on such deposit. If Tenant shall fully and faithfully perform every provision of this Lease to be performed by it, the Security Deposit or any balance thereof shall be returned to Tenant at such time after termination of this Lease when Landlord shall have determined that all of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease have been fulfilled.</p>
          <p id="s1p310">4</p>
          <p id="s1p311">6. ALTERATIONS.</p>
          <p id="s1p312">6.1 Except for those, if any, specifically provided for in Exhibit B to this Lease, Tenant shall not make or suffer to be made any alterations, additions, or improvements, including, but not limited to, the attachment of any fixtures or equipment in, on, or to the Premises or any part thereof or the making of any improvements as required by Article 7, without the prior written consent of Landlord. When applying for such consent, Tenant shall, if requested by Landlord, furnish complete plans and specifications for such alterations, additions and improvements. Landlord’s consent shall not be unreasonably withheld with respect to alterations which (i) are not structural in nature, (ii) are not visible from the exterior of the Building, (iii) do not affect or require modification of the Building’s electrical, mechanical, plumbing, HVAC or other systems, and (iv) in aggregate do not cost more than $5.00 per rentable square foot of that portion of the Premises affected by the alterations in question.</p>
          <p id="s1p313">6.2 In the event Landlord consents to the making of any such alteration, addition or improvement by Tenant, the same shall be made by using either Landlord’s contractor or a contractor reasonably approved by Landlord, in either event at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. If Tenant shall employ any contractor other than Landlord’s contractor and such other contractor or any subcontractor of such other contractor shall employ any non-union labor or supplier, Tenant shall be responsible for and hold Landlord harmless from any and all delays, damages and extra costs suffered by Landlord as a result of any dispute with any labor unions concerning the wage, hours, terms or conditions of the employment of any such labor. In any event Landlord may charge Tenant a construction management fee not to exceed five percent (5%) of the cost of such work to cover its overhead as it relates to such proposed work, plus third-party costs ac tually incurred by Landlord in connection with the proposed work and the design thereof, with all such amounts being due five (5) days after Landlord’s demand.</p>

Tenant shall pay in addition to any sums due pursuant to Article 4, any increase in real estate taxes attributable to any such alteration, addition or improvement for so long, during the Term, as such increase is ascer tainable; at Landlord’s election said sums shall be paid in the same way as sums due under Article 4. Landlord may, as a condition to its consent to any particular alterations or improvements, require Tenant to deposit with Landlord the amount reasonably estimated by Landlord as sufficient to cover the cost of removing such alterations or improvements and restoring the Premises, to the extent required under Section 26.2</p>

          <p id="s1p326">9.1 Tenant shall not have the right to assign or pledge this Lease or to sublet the whole or any part of the Premises whether voluntarily or by operation of law, or permit the use or occupancy of the Premises by anyone other than Tenant, and shall not make, suffer or permit such assignment, subleasing or occupancy without the prior written consent of Landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and said restrictions shall be binding upon any and all assignees of the Lease and subtenants of the Premises. In the event Tenant desires to sublet, or permit such occupancy of, the Premises,</p>
          <p id="s1p327">6</p>
          <p id="s1p328">or any portion thereof, or assign this Lease, Tenant shall give written notice thereof to Landlord at least sixty (60) days but no more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the proposed commencement date of such subletting or assignment, which notice shall set forth the name of the proposed subtenant or assignee, the relevant terms of any sublease or assignment and copies of financial reports and other relevant financial information of the proposed subtenant or assignee.</p>
          <p id="s1p329">9.2 Notwithstanding any assignment or subletting, permitted or otherwise, Tenant shall at all times remain directly, primarily and fully responsible and liable for the payment of the rent specified in this Lease and for compliance with all of its other obligations under the terms, provisions and covenants of this Lease. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, if the Premises or any part of them are then assigned or sublet, Landlord, in addition to any other remedies provided in this Lease or provided by law, may, at its option, collect directly from such assignee or subtenant all rents due and becoming due to Tenant under such assignment or sublease and apply such rent against any sums due to Landlord from Tenant under this Lease, and no such collection shall be construed to constitute a novation or release of Tenant from the further performance of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p330">9.3 In addition to Landlord’s right to approve of any subtenant or assignee, Landlord shall have the option, in its sole discretion, in the event of any proposed subletting or assignment, to terminate this Lease, or in the case of a proposed subletting of less than the entire Premises, to recapture the portion of the Premises to be sublet, as of the date the subletting or assignment is to be effective. The option shall be exercised, if at all, by Landlord giving Tenant written notice given by Landlord to Tenant within thirty (30) days following Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s written notice as required above. However, if Tenant notifies Landlord, within five (5) days after receipt of Landlord’s termination notice, that Tenant is rescinding its proposed assignment or sublease, the termination notice shall be void and the Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If this Lease shall be terminated with respect to the entire Premises pursuant to this Section, the Term of this Lease shall end on the date stated in Tenant’s notice as the effective date of the sublease or assignment as if that date had been originally fixed in this Lease for the expiration of the Term. If Landlord recaptures under this Section only a portion of the Premises, the rent to be paid from time to time during the unexpired Term shall abate proportionately based on the proportion by which the approximate square footage of the remaining portion of the Premises shall be less than that of the Premises as of the date immediately prior to such recapture. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s own cost and expense, discharge in full any outstanding commission obligation which may be due and owing as a result of any proposed assignment or subletting, whether or not the Premises are recaptured pursuant to this Section 9.3 and rented by Landlord to the proposed tenant or any other tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p331">9.4 In the event that Tenant sells, sublets, assigns or transfers this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of any Increased Rent (as defined below), less the Costs Component (as defined below), when and as such Increased Rent is received by Tenant. As used in this Section, “Increased Rent” shall mean the excess of (i) all rent and other consideration which Tenant is entitled to receive by reason of any sale, sublease, assignment or other transfer of this Lease, over (ii) the rent otherwise payable by Tenant under this Lease at such time. For purposes of the foregoing, any consideration received by Tenant in form other than cash shall be valued at its fair market value as determined by Landlord in good faith. The “Costs Component” is that amount which, if paid monthly, would fully amortize on a straight-line basis, over the entire period for which Ten ant is to receive Increased Rent, the reasonable costs incurred by Tenant for leasing commissions and tenant improvements in connection with such sublease, assignment or other transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p332">9.5 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, it shall be considered reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any assignment of this Lease or sublease of any portion of the Premises if at the time of either Tenant’s notice of the proposed assignment or sublease or the proposed commencement date thereof, there shall exist any uncured default of Tenant or matter which will become a default of Tenant with passage of time unless cured, or if the proposed assignee or sullessee is an entity: (a) with which Landlord is already in negotiation; (b) is already an occupant of the Building unless Landlord is unable to provide the amount of space required by such occupant; (c) is a governmental agency; (d) is incompatible with the character of occupancy of the Building; (e) with which the payment for the sublease or assignment is determined in whole or in part based upon its net income or profits; or (f) would subject the Premise s to a use which would: (i) involve increased personnel or wear upon the Building; (ii) violate any exclusive right granted to another tenant of the Building; (iii) require any addition to or modification of the Premises or the Building in order to comply with building code or other governmental requirements; or, (iv) involve a violation of Section 1.2. Tenant expressly agrees that for the purposes of any statutory or other requirement of reasonableness on the part of Landlord, Landlord’s refusal to consent to any assignment or sublease for any of the reasons described in this Section 9.5, shall be conclusively deemed to be reasonable.</p>
          <p id="s1p333">9.6 Upon any request to assign or sublet, Tenant will pay to Landlord the Assignment/Subletting Fee plus, on demand, a sum equal to all of Landlord’s costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred in investigating and considering any proposed or purported assignment or pledge of this Lease or sublease of any of the Premises, regardless of whether Landlord shall consent to, refuse consent, or determine that Landlord’s consent is not required for, such assignment, pledge or sublease. Any purported sale, assignment, mortgage, transfer of this Lease or subletting which does not comply with the provisions of this Article 9 shall be void.</p>
          <p id="s1p334">7</p>
          <p id="s1p335">9.7 If Tenant is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or trust, any transfer or transfers of or change or changes within any twelve (12) month period in the number of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or limited liability company, the general partnership interests in the partnership or the identity of the persons or entities controlling the activities of such partnership or trust resulting in the persons or entities owning or controlling a majority of such shares, partnership interests or activities of such partnership or trust at the beginning of such period no longer having such ownership or control shall be regarded as equivalent to an assignment of this Lease to the persons or entities acquiring such ownership or control and shall be subject to all the provisions of this Article 9 to the same extent and for all intents and purposes as though such an assignment.</p>
          <p id="s1p336">10. INDEMNIFICATION. None of the Landlord Entities shall be liable and Tenant hereby waives all claims against them for any damage to any property or any injury to any person in or about the Premises or the Building by or from any cause whatsoever (including without limiting the foregoing, rain or water leakage of any character from the roof, windows, walls, basement, pipes, plumbing works or appliances, the Building not being in good condition or repair, gas, fire, oil, electricity or theft), except to the extent caused by or arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its agents, employees or contractors. Tenant shall protect, indemnify and hold the Landlord Entities harmless from and against any and all loss, claims, liability or costs (including court costs and attorney’s fees) incurred by reason of (a) any damage to any property (including but not limited to property of any Landlord Entity) or any injury (including but not limited to death) to any p erson occurring in, on or about the Premises or the Building to the extent that such injury or damage shall be caused by or arise from any actual or alleged act, neglect, fault, or omission by or of Tenant or any Tenant Entity to meet any standards imposed by any duty with respect to the injury or damage; (b) the conduct or management of any work or thing whatsoever done by the Tenant in or about the Premises or from transactions of the Tenant concerning the Premises; (c) Tenant’s failure to comply with any and all governmental laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to the condition or use of the Premises or its occupancy; or (d) any breach or default on the part of Tenant in the performance of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Tenant to be performed pursuant to this Lease. The provisions of this Article shall survive the termination of this Lease with respect to any claims or liability accruing prior to such termination.</p>
          <p id="s1p337">11. INSURANCE.</p>
          <p id="s1p338">11.1 Tenant shall keep in force throughout the Term: (a) a Commercial General Liability insurance policy or policies to protect the Landlord Entities against any liability to the public or to any invitee of Tenant or a Landlord Entity incidental to the use of or resulting from any accident occurring in or upon the Premises with a limit of not less than $ 1,000,000 per occurrence and not less than $2,000,000 in the annual aggregate, or such larger amount as Landlord may prudently require from time to time, covering bodily injury and property damage liability and $1,000,000 products/completed operations aggregate; (b) Business Auto Liability covering owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a limit of not less than $ 1,000,000 per accident; (c) insurance protecting against liability under Worker’s Compensation Laws with limits at least as required by statute; (d) Employers Liability with limits of $1,000,000 each accident, $1,000,000 disease policy limit, $1,000,000 disease-each employee; (e) All Risk or Special Form coverage protecting Tenant against loss of or damage to Tenant’s alterations, additions, improvements, carpeting, floor coverings, panelings, decorations, fixtures, inventory and other business personal property situated in or about the Premises to the full replacement value of the property so insured, (f) Business Interruption Insurance for 100% of the 12 months actual loss sustained, and (g) Excess Liability in the amount of $1,000,000.</p>
          <p id="s1p339">11.2 The aforesaid policies shall (a) be provided at Tenant’s expense; (b) name the Landlord Entities as additional insureds (General Liability) and loss payee (Property—Special Form); (c) be issued by an insurance company with a minimum Best’s rating of “A:VII” during the Term; and (d) provide that said insurance shall not be canceled unless thirty (30) days prior written notice (ten days for non-payment of premium) shall have been given to Landlord; a certificate of Liability insurance on ACORD Form 25 and a certificate of Property insurance on ACORD Form 27 shall be delivered to Landlord by Tenant upon the Commencement Date and at least thirty (30) days prior to each renewal off said insurance.</p>
          <p id="s1p340">11.3 Whenever Tenant shall undertake any alterations, additions or improvements in, to or about the Premises (“Work”) the aforesaid insurance protection must extend to and include injuries to persons and damage to property arising in connection with such Work, without limitation including liability under any applicable structural work act, and such other insurance as Landlord shall require; and the policies of or certificates evidencing such insurance must be delivered to Landlord prior to the commencement of any such Work.</p>
          <p id="s1p341">8</p>
          <p id="s1p342">12. WAIVER OF SUBROGATION.</p>
          <p id="s1p343">So long as their respective insurers so permit, Tenant and Landlord hereby mutually waive their respective rights of recovery against each other for any loss insured by fire, extended coverage, All Risks or other insurance now or hereafter existing for the benefit of the respective party but only to the extent of the net insurance proceeds payable under such policies. Each party shall obtain any special endorsements required by their insurer to evidence compliance with the aforementioned waiver.</p>
          <p id="s1p344">13. SERVICES AND UTILITIES. Tenant shall pay for all-water, gas, heat, light, power, telephone, sewer, sprinkler system charges and other utilities and services used on or from the Premises, together with any taxes, penalties, and surcharges or the like pertaining thereto and any maintenance charges for utilities. Tenant shall furnish all electric light bulbs, tubes and ballasts, battery packs for emergency lighting and fire extinguishers. If any such services are not separately metered to Tenant, Tenant shall pay such proportion of all charges jointly metered with other premises as determined by Landlord, in its sole discretion, to be reasonable. Any such charges paid by Landlord and assessed against Tenant shall be immediately payable to Landlord on demand and shall be additional rent hereunder. Tenant will not, without the written consent of Landlord, contract with a utility provider to service the Premises with any utility, including, but not limited to, telecommunications, electri city, water, sewer or gas, which is not previously providing such service to other tenants in the Building. Landlord shall in no event be liable for any interruption or failure of utility services on or to the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p345">14. HOLDING OVER. Tenant shall pay Landlord for each day Tenant retains possession of the Premises or part of them after termination of this Lease by lapse of time or otherwise at the rate (“Holdover Rate”) which shall be Two Hundred Percent (200%) of the greater of (a) the amount of the Annual Rent for the last period prior to the date of such termination plus all Rent Adjustments under Article 4; and (b) the then market rental value of the Premises as determined by Landlord assuming a new lease of the Premises of the then usual duration and other terms, in either case, prorated on a daily basis, and also pay all damages sustained by Landlord by reason of such retention. If Landlord gives notice to Tenant of Landlord’s election to such effect, such holding over shall constitute renewal of this Lease for a period from month to month or one (1) year, whichever shall be specified in such notice, in either case at the Holdover Rate, but if the Landlord does not so elect, no such renewal shall result notwithstanding acceptance by Landlord of any sums due hereunder after such termination; and instead, a tenancy at sufferance at the Holdover Rate shall be deemed to have been created. In any event, no provision of this Article 14 shall be deemed to waive Landlord’s right of reentry or any other right under this Lease or at law.</p>
          <p id="s1p346">15. SUBORDINATION.</p>
          <p id="s1p347">Without the necessity of any additional document being executed by Tenant for the purpose of effecting a subordination, this Lease shall be subject and subordinate at all times to ground or underlying leases and to the lien of any mortgages or deeds of trust now or hereafter placed on, against or affecting the Building, Landlord’s interest or estate in the Building, or any ground or underlying lease; provided, however, that if the lessor, mortgagee, trustee, or holder of any such mortgage or deed of trust elects to have Tenant’s interest in this Lease be superior to any such instrument, then, by notice to Tenant, this Lease shall be deemed superior, whether this Lease was executed before or after said instrument. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver within ten (10) days of Landlord’s request such further instruments eviden cing such subordination or superiority of this Lease as may be required by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p348">16. RULES AND REGULATIONS. Tenant shall faithfully observe and comply with all the rules and regulations as set forth in Exhibit D to this Lease and all reasonable and non-discriminatory modifications of and additions to them from time to time put into effect by Landlord. Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant for the non-performance by any other tenant or occupant of the Building of any such rules and regulations.</p>
          <p id="s1p349">17. REENTRY BY LANDLORD.</p>
          <p id="s1p350">17.1 Landlord reserves and shall at all times, with 24 hour advance notice, except in the case of an emergency, have the right to re-enter the Premises to inspect the same, to show said Premises to prospective purchasers, mortgagees or tenants, and to alter, improve or repair the Premises and any portion of the Building, without abatement of rent, and may for that purpose erect, use and maintain scaffolding, pipes, conduits and other necessary structures and open any wall, ceiling or floor in and through the Building and Premises where reasonably required by the character of the Work to be performed, provided entrance to the Premises shall not be blocked thereby, and further provided that the business of Tenant shall not be interfered with unreasonably. Landlord shall have the right at any time to change the arrangement and/or locations of</p>

          <p id="s1p369">19.1.4.2 Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to relet the Premises or portions thereof to the extent required by applicable law. Landlord and Tenant agree that nevertheless Landlord shall at most be required to use only the same efforts Landlord then uses to lease premises in the Building generally and that in any case that Landlord shall not be required to give any preference or priority to the showing or leasing of the Premises or portions thereof over any other space that Landlord may be leasing or have available and may place a suitable prospective tenant in any such other space regardless of when such other space becomes available and that Landlord shall have the right to relet the Premises for a greater or lesser term than that remaining under this Lease, the right to relet only a portion of the Premises, or a portion of the Premises or the entire Premis es as a part of a larger area, and the right to change the character or use of the Premises.

          <p id="s1p370">19.1.4.3 Until such time as Landlord shall elect to terminate the Lease and shall thereupon be entitled to recover the amounts specified in such case in Section 19.1.3, Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand the full amount of all rent, including any amounts treated as additional rent under this Lease and other sums reserved in this Lease for the remaining Term, together with the costs of repairs, alterations, additions, redecorating and Landlord’s expenses of reletting and the collection of the rent accruing therefrom (including reasonable attorney’s fees and broker’s commissions), as the same shall then be due or become due from time to time, less only such consideration as Landlord may have received from any reletting of the Premises; and Tenant agrees that Landlord may file suits from time to time to recover any sums falling due under this Article 19 as they become due.

          <p id="s1p371">11</p>
          <p id="s1p372">19.2 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord may (but shall not be obligated to) cure such default at Tenant’s sole expense. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Landlord may, at Landlord’s option, enter into and upon the Premises if Landlord determines in its sole discretion that Tenant is not acting within a commercially reasonable time to maintain, repair or replace anything for which Tenant is responsible under this Lease or to otherwise effect compliance with its obligations under this Lease and correct the same, without being deemed in any manner guilty of trespass, eviction or forcible entry and detainer and without incurring any liability for any damage or interruption of Tenant’s business resulting therefrom and Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord within five (5) days of Landlord’s demand as additional rent, for any expenses which Landlord may incur in thus effecting compliance w ith Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, plus interest from the date of expenditure by Landlord at the Wall Street Journal prime rate.</p>
          <p id="s1p373">19.3 Tenant understands and agrees that in entering into this Lease, Landlord is relying upon receipt of all the Annual and Monthly Installments of Rent to become due with respect to all the Premises originally leased hereunder over the full Initial Term of this Lease for amortization, including interest at the Amortization Rate. For purposes hereof, the “Concession Amount” shall be defined as the aggregate of all amounts forgone or expended by Landlord as free rent under the lease, under Exhibit B hereof for construction allowances (excluding therefrom any amounts expended by Landlord for Landlord’s Work, as defined in Exhibit B), and for brokers’ commissions payable by reason of this Lease. Accordingly, Tenant agrees that if this Lease or Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises leased hereunder shall be terminated as of any date (“Default Termination Date”) prior to the expiration of the full Initial Term hereof by reason of a default of Tenant, there shall be due and owing to Landlord as of the day prior to the Default Termination Date, as rent in addition to all other amounts owed by Tenant as of such Date, the amount (“Unamortized Amount”) of the Concession Amount determined as set forth below; provided, however, that in the event that such amounts are recovered by Landlord pursuant to any other provision of this Article 19, Landlord agrees that it shall not attempt to recover such amounts pursuant to this Paragraph 19.3. For the purposes hereof, the Unamortized Amount shall be determined in the same manner as the remaining principal balance of a mortgage with interest at the A mortization Rate payable in level payments over the same length of time as from the effectuation of the Concession concerned to the end of the full Initial Term of this Lease would be determined. The foregoing provisions shall also apply to and upon any reduction of space in the Premises, as though such reduction were a termination for Tenant’s default, except that (i) the Unamortized Amount shall be reduced by any amounts paid by Tenant to Landlord to effectuate such reduction and (ii) the manner of application shall be that the Unamortized Amount shall first be determined as though for a full termination as of the Effective Date of the elimination of the portion, but then the amount so determined shall be multiplied by the fraction of which the numerator is the rentable square footage of the eliminated portion and the denominator is the rentable square footage of the Premises originally leased hereunder; and the amount thus obtained shall be the Unamortized Amount.</p>

Within forty-five (45) days from the date of such damage, Landlord shall notify Tenant, in writing, of Landlord’s reasonable estimation of the length of time within which material restoration can be made, and Landlord’s determination shall be binding on Tenant. For purpos es of this Lease, the Building or Premises shall be deemed “materially restored” if they are in such condition as would not prevent or materially interfere with Tenant’s use of the Premises for the purpose for which it was being used immediately before such damage.</p>

If neither party to this Lease shall so elect to terminate this Lease, the rental thereafter to be paid shall be adjusted on a fair and equitable basis under the circumstances, In addition to the rights of Landlord above, if any substantial part of the Building shall be taken or appropriated by any public or quasi-public authority under the power of eminent domain or conveyance in lie u thereof, and regardless of whether the Premises or any part thereof are so taken or appropriated, Landlord shall have the right, at its sole option, to terminate this Lease. Landlord shall be entitled to any and all income, rent, award, or any interest whatsoever in or upon any such sum, which may be paid or made in connection with any such public or quasi-public use or purpose, and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord any interest it may have in or claim to all or any part of such sums, other than any separate award which may be made with respect to Tenant’s trade fixtures and moving expenses; Tenant shall make no claim for the value of any unexpired Term.</p>

In the event of Tenant’s failure to arrange such joint inspections and/or participate in either such inspection, Landlord’s inspection at or after Tenant’s vacating the Premises shall be conclusively deemed correct for purposes of determining Tenant’s responsibility for repairs and restoration.</p>

Presson Scottsdale, LLC and PICOR will be your local representative for building and lease needs. As your primary contact, I look forward to meeting and handling your space needs. Please call me with any questions or concerns you may have regarding building and property issues or maintenance requests. I can be reached at 748-7100 or on my direct line listed on the attached business card.</p>
          <p id="s1p1354">Our office hours are Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 5:30 pm. After hours and on weekends, our switchboard will provide you with an emergency pager number.</p>
          <p id="s1p1355">Here are a few items that we would like to note:</p>
          <p id="s1p1356">1.</p>

          <p id="s1p1358">There is one rental coupon on your coupon sheet designated for each month in the twelve-month period. The coupon reflects all the information necessary to make your payment. The information includes: It is important that the rent coupon be included with the payment so that your payment is posted properly; the payments are being mailed to a lockbox.</p>

          <p id="s1p1380">In the event there is a returned item on any payments you submit, your account will be assessed an NSF (non sufficient funds) charge of $50.00.</p>

          <p id="s1p1432">WITNESSETH: That Landlord, in consideration of the covenants of Tenant hereinafter set forth does, by these presents, lease to Tenant the Premises described on Exhibit A (the “Premises”) for the term set forth on Exhibit A (the “Term”), for the rent provided for in Exhibit A (the “Rent”).</p>
          <p id="s1p1433">1. PAYMENT OF RENTAL FEES. The fees herein specified shall be paid to Landlord or Landlord’s agent at such place as shall, from time to time, be designated by Landlord. All rental charges are due and payable the 1st of each month. A late fee often percent (10%) will be charged if received after due date.</p>
          <p id="s1p1434">2. SECURITY DEPOSIT. Tenant has deposited the security deposit set forth on Exhibit A with Landlord, to be held by Landlord at no interest accruing to Tenant, which sum may be commingled with other funds, not as payment of advance rent, but as a security and damage deposit for: (a) full and faithful performance by Tenant of all Tenant’s obligations hereunder and all supplemental Rules and Regulations and (b) payment by the Tenant for all the goods and/or services which Tenant may purchase from Landlord pursuant to separate agreement. Subject security deposit shall be held for the term of Tenant’s occupancy of space within the Ruthrauff Commerce Center plus 30 days, provided all outstanding business, word processing, photo copying and fax services, mail handling, furniture rental, or other services for which expenses have been ascertained and which are properly chargeable to Tenant have been paid in full, and that Tenant is not in default of any of the terms, conditions or cov enants of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p1435">3. USE. The Premises may be used only as and for a business office and for no other purpose. Under no circumstances shall the Premises ever be used for cooking, sleeping, or as a place of entertainment or social gathering.</p>
          <p id="s1p1436">4. PARKING. No part of any parking area adjoining the Premises is leased hereunder. Tenant specifically acknowledges that parking is not permitted at the rear of building 2410. Parking shall be provided for Tenant and Tenant’s employees through the marked parking areas within the Ruthrauff Commerce Center and for Tenant’s customers and invitees, in the designated parking areas adjacent to or near building 2410 West Ruthrauff. Landlord retains the right to designate specific parking stalls or general areas which Landlord, at Landlord’s sole option, deems appropriate to ensure fair treatment of all Tenants of the Center, their employees, customers and invitees.</p>
          <p id="s1p1437">5. DELIVERY OF POSSESSION. Tenant agrees that, in the event of the inability of Landlord to deliver to Tenant possession of subject Premises at the commencement of Tenant’s term, Landlord shall not be liable for any damages caused thereby, nor shall this Lease be void or voidable, but the term hereof shall be extended for a period equal to the delay of such delivery.
