          <p id="s1p33">DEFAULTS. Tenant shall be in default of this Lease if Tenant fails to fulfill any lease obligation or term by which Tenant is bound. Subject to any governing provisions of law to the contrary, if Tenant fails to cure any financial obligation within 10 days (or any other obligation within 30 days) after written notice of such default is provided by Landlord to Tenant, Landlord may take possession of the Premises without further notice (to the extent permitted by law), and without prejudicing Landlord’s rights to damages.

Tenant shall pay all costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees and expenses) suffered by Landlord by reason of Tenant’s defaults.

Such construction shall be undertaken and such fixtures may be erected only with the prior written consent of the Landlord which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Tenant shall not install awnings or advertisements on any part of the Premises without Landlord’s prior written consent. At the end of the lease term, Tenant shall be entitled to remove (or at the request of Landlord shall remove) such fixtures, and shall restore the Premises to substantially the same condition of the Premises at the commencement of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p36">ACCESS BY LANDLORD TO PREMISES. Subject to Tenant’s consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises to make inspections, provide necessary services, or show the unit to prospective buyers, mortgagees, tenants or workers. However, Landlord does not assume any liability for the care or supervision of the Premises. As provided by law, in the case of an emergency, Landlord may enter the Premises without Tenant’s consent. During the last three months of this Lease, or any extension of this Lease, Landlord shall be allowed to display the usual “To Let” signs and show the Premises to prospective tenants.</p>
          <p id="s1p37">INDEMNITY REGARDING USE OF PREMISES. To the extent permitted by law, Tenant agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Landlord from and against any and all losses, claims, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, if any, which Landlord may suffer or incur in connection with Tenant’s possession, use or misuse of the Premises, except Landlord’s act or negligence.</p>
