If Landlord, for any reason whatsoever, does not deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant on the scheduled Delivery Date, this Lease shall not be void or voidable and Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, but in such event, the Delivery Date shall be postponed until the date on which Landlord delivers possession of the Premises to Tenant in the condition required by Section 5.A below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord does not deliver the Premises to Tenant with Landlord’s Work substantially completed: (i) on or before July 1, 2014 (the “First Delivery Deadline”) (which date is subject to extension for force majeure events pursuant to the terms of Article 25 below), then Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against the Rent due hereunder in an amount equal to one (1) day of Monthly Rent for each day after the First Delivery Deadline until the earlier of July 31, 2014 or the day the Premises are delivered to Tenant with Landlord’s Work substantially completed, (ii) on or before August1, 2014 (the “Second Delivery Deadline”) (which date is subject to extension for force majeure events pursuant to the terms of Article 25 below), then Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against the Rent due hereunder in an amount equal to two (2) days of Monthly Rent for each day after the Second Delivery Deadline until the earlier of August 31, 2014 or the day the Premises are delivered to Tenant with Landlord’s Work substantially completed, and (iii) on or before September 1, 2014 (the “Termination Date”) (which date is subject to extension for force majeure events pursuant to the terms of Article 25 below), then Tenant, as Tenant’s sole remedy, may terminate this Lease upon written notice thereof to Landlord at least fifteen (15) days in advance of Tenant’s proposed termination date, and this Lease shall terminate as of such termination date unless Landlord substantially completes Landlord’s Work and delivers the Premises to Tenant on or before Tenant’s proposed termination date. Subject to any temporary shutdown for repairs, for security purposes, for compliance with any Laws (as defined below), or due to strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, fire or other casualty, acts of God, acts of terror, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, Tenant shall have access to the Premises twenty-four (24) hours a day, each day of the Term.

          <p id="s1p120">RENT</p>
          <p id="s1p121">A. Monthly Rent. Commencing as of the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay Monthly Rent in the amount set forth in Schedule 1 attached hereto in advance on or before the first day of each calendar month of the Term. If the Rent Commencement Date shall occur on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, or if the Term shall end on a day other than the last day of a calendar month, the Monthly Rent for the partial month shall be prorated on a per diem basis.</p>

All costs and expenses which Tenant assumes or agrees to pay and any other sum payable by Tenant pursuant to this Lease (other than Monthly Rent), including, without limitation, Tenant’s Share of Taxes and Operating Expenses, shall be deemed Additional Rent, and all remedies applicable to the nonpayment of Monthly Rent shall be applicable thereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">C. Rent. Monthly Rent and Additional Rent are herein referred to collectively as “Rent”. Landlord may apply payments received from Tenant to any obligations of Tenant then accrued, without regard to such obligations as may be designated by Tenant. Upon signing this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to the Monthly Rent for the first full calendar month of the Term in which Monthly Rent is payable, which amount Landlord shall apply to the Monthly Rent for such first full calendar month.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">D. Place of Payment, Late Charge, Default Interest. Rent and other charges required to be paid under this Lease, no matter how described, shall be paid by Tenant to the lockbox location designated by Landlord, or to such other person or at such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing, without any prior notice or demand therefor and without deduction or set-off or counterclaim or, except as expressly provided in this Lease, abatement. At Tenant’s election, Tenant’s payment of Rent and other charges required to be paid under this Lease may be made by means of wire transfer to an account designated by Landlord for such purpose. In the event Tenant fails to pay any Rent due under this Lease when due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a late charge of five percent (5) on the amount overdue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall waive the first such late charge in any calendar year, so long as Tenant pays such overdue amount within five (5) days following Landlord’s written notice to Tenant that the same is past due. Any Rent not paid when due shall also bear interest at the Default Rate from the date due until the date received by Landlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall waive the first such interest charge in any calendar year, so long as Tenant pays such overdue amount within five (5) days following Landlord’s written notice to Tenant that the same is past due.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">ARTICLE 4.</p>
          <p id="s1p127">TAXES AND OPERATING EXPENSES</p>
          <p id="s1p128">A. Payment of Taxes and Operating Expenses. Commencing as of the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay Tenant’s Share of Operating Expenses and Taxes (collectively, “Expenses”) incurred by Landlord during each Lease Year. To implement the foregoing, promptly following the commencement of the Term and prior to the commencement of each subsequent Lease Year (or as soon thereafter as practicable), Landlord shall estimate the Expenses payable by Tenant for such Lease Year pursuant to this Section. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on the first day of each month, in advance, one-twelfth (1/12) of Landlord’s estimated amount. If at any time during the course of the year Landlord determines that the Expenses payable by Tenant will vary from the then estimated amount, by notice to Tenant Landlord may revise the amount payable by Tenant during the balance of the Lease Year such that the total estimated additional amount due from Tenant for such Lease Year is paid by Tenant during the</p>
          <p id="s1p129">-5-</p>
          <p id="s1p130">balance of the Lease Year in equal monthly amounts. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of each Lease Year, or as soon thereafter as practicable, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a statement to account for any difference between the actual and the estimated Expenses for the previous Lease Year. If such statement is not given for any Lease Year, Tenant shall continue to pay on the basis of the prior Lease Year’s estimate until the month after such notice is given. Landlord’s annual statement shall be final and binding upon Tenant unless, within ninety (90) days after delivery thereof to Tenant, Tenant shall contest any item therein by written notice to Landlord, specifying each item contested and the reason therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Taxes included in any such annual statement may be modified by any subsequent adjustment or retroactive application of Taxes affecting the calculation of Expenses. If Tenant has overpaid the amount of Expenses owing pursuant to this Article, Landlord shall credit the overpayment against Tenant’s next payments due under this Article. If Tenant has underpaid the amount of Expenses owing pursuant to this Article, Tenant shall pay the amount of the underpayment to Landlord within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s statement. If the rentable area of the Building or the Project is not fully occupied during any Lease Year, Expenses for such Lease Year shall be adjusted to equal Landlord’s reasonable estimate of the Expenses which would have been incurred during such Lease Year if the total rentable area of the Building and Project were occupied. Landlord’s delay in submitting any statement contemplated herein for any Lease Year shall not affect the provisions of this Article, nor constitute a waiver of Landlord’s rights as set forth herein for said Lease Year or any subsequent Lease Years during the Term or any extensions thereof. If the Term ends on a day other than the last day of a Lease Year, the amounts payable by Tenant under this Article 4 applicable to the Lease Year in which the end of the Term occurs shall be prorated on the basis which the number of days from the commencement of such Lease Year to and including the date on which the end of the Term occurs bears to three hundred sixty-five (365).</p>
          <p id="s1p131">B. Tenant Audit Right. If Tenant desires to dispute or question an amount shown on the annual statement, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of such desire within ninety (90) days after Tenant’s receipt of the annual statement. If Tenant does not give Landlord such notice within such time, Tenant shall have waived its right to dispute or question the annual statement. Promptly after the receipt of such written notice from Tenant, Landlord and Tenant shall endeavor in good faith to resolve such dispute or address Tenant’s questions, as the case may be. Regardless of whether any such dispute or question shall exist, Tenant shall have the right to cause a nationally or regionally recognized independent certified public accountant designated by Tenant, to be paid on an hourly and not a contingent fee basis, to audit the annual statement or any amounts shown thereon, provided that Tenant (i) notifies Landlord in writing of Tenant’s intention to exercise such audit right within ninety (90) days after Tenant’s receipt of the annual statement, (ii) actually begins such audit within forty-five (45) days after the notice from Tenant to Landlord advising Landlord that Tenant will require an audit (provided that such forty-five (45) day period within which the audit must be commenced shall be extended by the length of any delay in the commencement of the audit that is caused by Landlord) and (iii) diligently pursues such audit to completion as quickly as reasonably possible. Landlord agrees to make available to Tenant’s auditors, at Landlord’s office in the Building or at such other location in the San Francisco Bay Area as Landlord shall determine, the books and records relevant to the audit for review and copying (including accounting records on magnetic tape or diskette), but such books and records (and tapes and diskettes) may not be removed from Landlord’s offices.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">-6-</p>
          <p id="s1p133">Tenant shall bear all costs of such audit, including Landlord’s actual copying costs and personnel costs, if any incurred in connection with such audit (provided that, prior to incurring any personnel costs in connection with any such audit, Landlord shall advise Tenant of Landlord’s anticipated personnel costs so that Tenant may, at Tenant’s option, modify Tenant’s activities with regard to such audit in order to preclude the need for Landlord to incur such personnel costs), except that, if the audit (as conducted and certified by the auditor) shows an aggregate overstatement of Expenses of five percent (5%) or more, and Landlord’s auditors concur in such findings (or, in the absence of such concurrence, such overstatement is confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction or such other dispute resolution mechanism as to which the parties mutually agree in writing), then Landlord shall bear all costs of the audit. If the agreed or confirmed audit shows an underpayment of Expenses by Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after the audit is agreed to or confirmed, the amount owed to Landlord, and, if the agreed or confirmed audit shows an overpayment of Expenses by Tenant, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for such overpayment within thirty (30) days after the audit is agreed to or confirmed.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, Tenant’s audit rights under this Section 4.B. shall be conditioned upon (i) Tenant having paid the total amounts billed by Landlord under this Article 4 within the time stipulated herein for payment (including, without limitation, the contested amounts) and (ii) Tenant and its auditor executing, prior to the commencement of the audit, a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord in which Tenant and its auditor shall agree to keep confidential, and not disclose to any other party, except as required by applicable Law, the results of any such audit or any action taken by Landlord in response thereto.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">C. Personal Property and Other Taxes. Tenant shall pay, at least ten (10) days before delinquency, any and all taxes, fees, charges or other governmental impositions levied or assessed against Landlord or Tenant (a) upon Tenant’s equipment, furniture, fixtures, and other personal property located in the Premises, (b) by virtue of any Alterations made by Tenant to the Premises, and (c) upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises. If any such fee, charge or other governmental imposition is paid by Landlord, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord’s payment upon demand.</p>
          <p id="s1p136">D. Net Lease. This shall be a Net Lease and Monthly Rent shall be paid to Landlord absolutely net of all costs and expenses except as expressly herein provided. The provisions for Tenant’s payment of Tenant’s Share of Expenses are intended to pass on to Tenant and reimburse Landlord for Tenant’s Share of all costs and expenses associated with the Project, except as expressly provided in this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p140">DATE; ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS</p>
          <p id="s1p141">A. Condition of Premises on Commencement Date. Prior to the Delivery Date, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense Landlord shall substantially complete Landlord’s Work as set forth in Section 5.E. below. Except for Landlord’s Work, the Ground Floor Lobby Work (as defined in Section 5.E. below), the Ceiling and Carpet Work (as defined in Section 5.E.), and the Meter Installation Work (as defined in Section 7.A.), Tenant shall accept the Premises on the Delivery Date in its then “as-is” condition, and Landlord shall have no obligation to make or, except as provided in Section 5.B below, pay for any alterations, additions or improvements to prepare the Premises for Tenant’s occupancy pursuant to this Lease. Neither Landlord nor Landlord’s agents have made any representations or warranties with respect to the condition of the Building, the Project, the Land, the present or future suitability or fitness of the Premises, the Building or the Project for the conduct of Tenant’s particular business, or any other matter or thing affecting or related to the Premises, the Building or the Project, and no rights, easements or licenses are acquired by Tenant by implication or otherwise except as expressly set forth in this Lease. Any improvements or personal property located in the Premises are delivered without any representation or warranty from Landlord, either express or implied, of any kind, including, without limitation, title, merchantability, or suitability or a particular purpose.</p>
          <p id="s1p142">B. Tenant’s Work; Landlord’s Allowance; Test Fit Allowance. Landlord acknowledges that Tenant intends to perform certain initial Alterations (as defined in Section 5.C. below) to the Premises for Tenant’s occupancy pursuant to this Lease. Such initial Alterations are referred to herein as ‘Tenant’s Work”. Tenant shall complete all of Tenant’s Work in good and workmanlike manner, by a general contractor (the “Contractor”) and subcontractors approved by Landlord, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, fully paid for and free from liens, in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by Landlord and Tenant, and in compliance with the provisions of Section 5.C. below. Subject to Landlord’s approval and the provisions of Section 5.C. below, Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, shall have the right to install its own security system within the Premises, so long as such security system is compatible with the fire and life safety systems of the Building, as determined by Landlord, and as part of its security system work described above, Tenant may install key card readers in locations approved by Landlord. If Tenant installs any of the security features described above, Tenant shall provide Landlord with key cards to access such areas.</p>
          <p id="s1p143">Landlord shall contribute toward the reasonable cost of the construction and installation of Tenant’s Work an aggregate amount not to exceed Landlord’s Allowance set forth in the Basic Provisions of Article 1; provided, however, that no portion of Landlord’s Allowance may be used for Monthly Rent, Additional Rent or other amounts payable pursuant to this Lease, personal property, equipment, or trade fixtures (except as hereinafter provided) or otherwise applied on account of amounts owing by Tenant to Landlord hereunder; provided, however, that a portion of the Landlord’s Allowance not in excess of Seven Dollars ($7.00) per rentable square foot of the Premises may be used by Tenant for the purchase, delivery and installation of Tenant’s furniture, fixtures, equipment and trade fixtures to be used by Tenant in the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p144">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.B., Landlord’s Allowance shall be available for disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof only until March 31, 2015. Accordingly, if any portion of Landlord’s Allowance is not requested by Tenant, together with Tenant’s delivery to Landlord of all lien releases and other documents required hereunder as a condition to Landlord’s disbursement thereof, prior to March 31, 2015, such unused portion shall be forfeited by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">-8-</p>
          <p id="s1p146">If the cost of construction of Tenant’s Work exceeds the funds available therefor from Landlord’s Allowance, then Tenant shall pay all such excess (the “Excess Cost”). Based on the estimated cost (the “Estimated Costs”) of the construction of Tenant’s Work, the prorata share of the Estimated Costs payable by Landlord and Tenant shall be determined and an appropriate percentage share established for each (a “Share of Costs”). Tenant and Landlord shall fund the cost of such work as the same is performed, in accordance with their respective Share of Costs for such work. At such time as Landlord’s Allowance with respect to Tenant’s Work has been entirely disbursed, Tenant shall pay the remaining Excess Cost, if any, which payments shall be made in installments as construction progresses in the same manner as Tenant’s payments of Tenant’s Share of Costs were paid.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">Landlord shall disburse Landlord’s Allowance directly to Tenant within thirty (30) days after Landlord’s receipt of (A) invoices of Contractor furnished to Landlord by Tenant covering work actually performed, construction in place and materials delivered to the site (as may be applicable) describing in reasonable detail such work, construction and/or materials, (B) conditional lien waivers executed by Contractor, subcontractors or suppliers, as applicable, for their portion of the work covered by the requested disbursement, and (C) unconditional lien waivers executed by Contractor, subcontractors or suppliers, as applicable, for those performing the work or supplying the materials covered by Landlord’s previous disbursements for the work or materials covered by such previous disbursements (all such waivers to be in the forms prescribed by California Civil Code Sections 8132 and 8134). No payment will be made for materials or supplies not incorporated into the construction, regardless of whether the materials or supplies are located on the Premises. Landlord may withhold the amount of any and all retentions provided for in original contracts or subcontracts until expiration of the applicable lien periods or Landlord’s receipt of unconditional lien waivers and full releases upon final payment (in the form prescribed by California Civil Code Section 8138) from Tenant’s Contractor and all subcontractors and suppliers involved in Tenant’s Work. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Landlord be obligated to disburse any portion of Landlord’s Allowance (i) during any period that Tenant is in breach of or in default under this Lease, or (ii) for any Tenant’s Work (or other permitted associated costs) in space Tenant intends to sublease prior to Tenant’s initial occupancy of such space for the conduct of Tenant’s business.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">The Reimbursable Costs pursuant to Section 5.C. below shall be payable to Landlord with respect to Tenant’s Work; provided, however, that the Reimbursable Costs payable by Tenant to Landlord with respect to Tenant’s Work shall not exceed two percent (2%) of the total “hard” construction cost of Tenant’s Work (i.e., excluding architectural, engineering and permit fees). At the time Landlord makes any disbursement of Landlord’s Allowance, Landlord shall retain from Landlord’s Allowance, as a partial payment of the Reimbursable Costs, the Reimbursable Costs incurred to date by Landlord with respect to Tenant’s Work. At such time as Landlord’s Allowance has been entirely disbursed, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days of Landlord’s written demand from time to time, pay to Landlord the remainder, if any, of the Reimbursable Costs theretofore due and not yet paid to Landlord. Upon completion of Tenant’s Work, Tenant shall furnish Landlord with invoices and other documentation reasonably required by Landlord to evidence the total cost of Tenant’s Work.</p>
          <p id="s1p149">-9-</p>
          <p id="s1p150">In addition to Landlord’s Allowance, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant up to $0.10 per rentable square foot of the Premises (i.e., $6,471.90) towards the architectural costs incurred by Tenant for a “test-fit” preliminary plan of the Premises. Landlord shall make such reimbursement to Tenant promptly after Landlord’s receipt from Tenant of the test-fit drawings.</p>
          <p id="s1p151">C. Alterations. Tenant shall make no alterations, additions or improvements (“Alterations”; which term shall include Tenant’s Work) to the Premises without the prior written consent of the Landlord, which consent Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay. Landlord shall either approve or disapprove any proposed contractors and plans and specifications for the Tenant Work and any Alterations within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of Tenant’s request therefor together with all information reasonably required by Landlord with respect thereto. All Alterations shall be made at Tenant’s sole cost and expense (including the expense of complying with all Laws, including those regarding Hazardous Materials, if applicable, and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, as heretofore amended and as amended from time to time (the “ADA”) and Title 24 requirements), in a good and workmanlike manner, by a contractor reasonably approved by Landlord. Tenant, at Tenant’s expense (or, at Landlord’s election, Landlord at Tenant’s expense) shall perform any work required to be performed in areas outside the Premises by reason of the Alterations. Tenant shall submit to Landlord, for Landlord’s prior written approval, complete plans and specifications for all work to be done by Tenant. Such plans and specifications shall be prepared by responsible licensed architect(s) and engineer(s) approved in writing by Landlord, shall comply with all applicable Laws, shall not adversely affect the Base Building Components (as defined in Section 12.B. below), shall be in a form sufficient to secure the approval of all government authorities with jurisdiction over the approval thereof, and shall be otherwise satisfactory to Landlord in Landlord’s reasonable discretion. Tenant shall provide Landlord advance written notice of the licensed architect(s) and engineer(s) whom Tenant proposes to engage to prepare such plans and specifications. Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing whether Landlord approves or disapproves such architect(s) and engineer(s). Landlord’s approval or consent to any such work shall not impose any liability upon Landlord, and no action taken by Landlord in connection with such approval, including, without limitation, attending construction meetings of Tenant’s contractors, shall render Tenant the agent of Landlord for purposes of constructing any Alterations. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within thirty (30) days after Landlord’s written demand for Landlord’s reasonable out of pocket expenses in connection with any Alterations, such as additional cleaning expenses, additional security services, fees and charges paid to third party architects, engineers and other consultants for review of the work and the plans and specifications with respect thereto, and to monitor contractor compliance with Building or Project construction requirements, and for other miscellaneous reasonable out of pocket costs incurred by Landlord as result of the work (collectively, “Reimbursable Costs”); provided, however, that in no event shall the Reimbursable Costs for any Alteration exceed two percent (2%) of the total hard costs of such Alteration. Any Alterations, including, without limitation, moveable partitions that are affixed to the Premises (but excluding moveable, free standing partitions) and all carpeting, shall at once become part of the Building and the property of Landlord. Except as Landlord shall otherwise agree in writing as respects any particular Alterations, at Landlord’s sole election made in writing at the time the Alterations in question are consented to by Landlord (or, with respect to Cosmetic Alterations, within ten (10) Business Days after Tenant gives Landlord notice thereof), any or all Alterations made for or by Tenant shall be removed by Tenant from the Premises at the expiration or sooner termination of this</p>
          <p id="s1p152">-10-</p>
          <p id="s1p153">Lease and the Premises shall be restored by Tenant to their condition prior to the making of the Alterations, ordinary wear and tear excepted; provided, however, that Tenant shall not be required to remove any Alterations that are of a type and quantity that would reasonably be installed by or for a typical tenant using space for general office purposes in a normal and customary manner.</p>
          <p id="s1p154">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right, without Landlord’s consent, to make any Alteration that meets all of the following criteria (a “Cosmetic Alteration”): (a) the Alteration is decorative in nature (such as paint, carpet or other wall or floor finishes, movable partitions or other such work), (b) at least ten (10) days prior to commencement of work with respect to such Alteration, Tenant provides Landlord with plans with respect thereto or, if the Alteration is of such a nature that formal plans will not be prepared for the work, Tenant provides Landlord with a reasonably specific written description of the work, (c) such Alteration does not affect the Base Building Components or any structural components of the Building, and such Alteration is not visible from the exterior of the Premises, (d) the work will not decrease the value of the Premises, does not require a building permit or other governmental permit, uses only new materials comparable in quality to those being replaced and is performed in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with all Laws, (e) the work does not involve opening the ceiling of the Premises, (f) the work does not involve any Hazardous Materials other than incidental quantities of the same in normal and customary construction materials, such as paint, and (g) the total cost of the Alteration, including architectural and engineering fees, if any, does not exceed Sixty-Six Thousand Dollars ($66,000.00).</p>
          <p id="s1p155">Tenant hereby acknowledges that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Landlord is not and shall not be deemed to be a “participating owner” with respect to any Alterations (including, without limitation, Tenant’s Work). Prior to commencement of any work at the Premises, Tenant shall obtain from all contractors, subcontractors, laborers, materialmen, and suppliers performing work in the Premises for Tenant a writing or writings duly executed by authorized representatives of such contractors, subcontractors, laborers, materialmen, or suppliers containing the following language or substantially identical provisions:</p>
          <p id="s1p156">“Contractor acknowledges and agrees that it is performing a work of improvement on a Tenant’s leasehold interest and agrees to limit any right to impose a mechanic’s or materialman’s lien to Tenant’s leasehold interest. Contractor further agrees that the work of improvement is not being performed at Landlord’s insistence, is not being performed for the benefit of Landlord or Landlord’s ownership (fee) interest, and that Landlord is not directing Contractor’s work. Contractor further agrees that Landlord is not participating in the work of improvement or in Tenant’s enterprise. Contractor further agrees that it will provide Landlord with written notice of commencement of work within three (3) business days following commencement, so that Landlord may timely post a Notice of Non-Responsibility. Contractor waives and relinquishes the benefit of the “participating owner” doctrine as stated in California law, and further waives and relinquishes any right it may otherwise have had to impose any mechanic’s or materialman’s lien on Landlord’s ownership interest in the property.”</p>
          <p id="s1p157">-11-</p>
          <p id="s1p158">D. Liens. Tenant shall give Landlord at least ten (10) days prior written notice (or such additional time as may be necessary under applicable Laws) of the commencement of any Tenant’s Work or any other Alterations, to afford Landlord the opportunity of posting and recording notices of non-responsibility. Tenant shall not cause or permit any mechanic’s, materialman’s or similar liens or encumbrances to be filed or exist against the Premises or the Building or Tenant’s interest in this Lease in connection with work done by Tenant under this Article or in connection with any other work done by Tenant. Tenant shall remove any such lien or encumbrance by bond or otherwise within ten (10) days from the date of their existence. If Tenant fails to do so, Landlord may pay the amount or take such other action as Landlord deems necessary to remove any such lien or encumbrance, without being responsible to investigate the validity thereof. The amounts so paid and costs incurred by Landlord shall be deemed Additional Rent under this Lease and payable in full upon demand.</p>
          <p id="s1p159">E. Landlord’s Work; Ground Floor Lobby Work; Ceiling and Carpet Work. Landlord, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, shall substantially complete the following improvements to the Building prior to delivery of the Premises to Tenant (collectively, “Landlord’s Work”): (i) restrooms on both floors refreshed to include new vanities, mirrors, lighting and paint, including a shower; and (ii) such work, if any, as shall be required to put the Base Building Components (as defined in Section 12.B. below) in good working order. In addition, after delivery of the Premises to Tenant but prior to the Commencement Date, Landlord, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, shall substantially complete a finished ground floor lobby in the Building with an adjacent unisex restroom (the “Ground Floor Lobby Work”). In addition, after delivery of the Premises to Tenant and within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s notice to Landlord requesting that Landlord perform the following work, Landlord, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, shall substantially complete the following improvements to the Premises: (x) new 2’ x 2’ suspended ceiling on both floors of the Premises, with 2’ x 4’ LED lights, and with approximately 30% of the ceiling on the second floor open to the structure above with pendant LED lights; and (y) installation of carpet tile on approximately 100% of the flooring on both floors of the Premises (collectively, the “Ceiling and Carpet Work”). Landlord’s Work, the Ground Floor Lobby Work and the Ceiling and Carpet Work shall be constructed using Building standard materials and finishes (or such other materials and finishes as Landlord and Tenant shall agree), in a good and workmanlike manner, and in compliance with all Laws, including, without limitation, ADA and Title 24 requirements. Landlord’s Work, the Ground Floor Lobby Work, and the Ceiling and Carpet Work shall be deemed “substantially complete” when it has been completed substantially in accordance with the plans applicable thereto, subject only to completion of any incomplete or defective work or materials in Landlord’s Work, the Ground Floor Lobby Work or the Ceiling and Carpet Work, as applicable, which do not materially impair Tenant’s construction of Tenant’s Work. Tenant acknowledges that the Ground Floor Lobby Work, the Ceiling and Carpet Work, and any remaining items of Landlord’s Work may be performed by Landlord following the Delivery Date during and/or after Normal Business Hours, as Landlord shall elect. Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate with each other in order to enable the Ground Floor Lobby Work, the Ceiling and Carpet Work and any remaining items of Landlord’s Work to be performed in a timely manner and with as little inconvenience to Tenant’s completion of the Tenant’s Work as is reasonably possible. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any delay in the completion of the Ground Floor Lobby Work, Landlord’s Work, or the Ceiling and Carpet Work or inconvenience suffered by Tenant in the Premises during the performance of the Ground Floor Work, Landlord’s Work,</p>
          <p id="s1p160">-12-</p>
          <p id="s1p161">or the Ceiling and Carpet Work shall not subject Landlord to any liability for any loss or damage resulting therefrom or entitle Tenant to any credit, abatement or adjustment of rent or other sums payable under the Lease, except that (I) the Rent Commencement Date shall be delayed one (1) day for each day that Tenant is actually delayed in substantial completion of Tenant’s Work as a result of Landlord’s performance of the Ground Floor Lobby Work after the Commencement Date, other than such delays attributable to Tenant Delay, and (II) the Rent Commencement Date shall be delayed one (1) day for each day that Tenant is actually delayed in substantial completion of Tenant’s Work as result of Landlord’s failure to substantially complete the Ceiling and Carpet Work within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s request that Landlord perform the same, other than delays in substantial completion of the Ceiling and Carpet Work attributable to Tenant Delay; provided that in each case of clauses (I) and (II) above Tenant shall give Landlord at least two (2) Business Days’ notice of the delay in Tenant’s Work so claimed by Tenant and Landlord shall fail to alleviate the circumstances giving rise to such delay by the expiration of such two (2) Business Day period. Tenant shall upon demand reimburse Landlord for any expenses incurred by Landlord as the result of a Tenant Delay. As used herein, “Tenant Delay” means Tenant’s interference with Landlord’s performance of the Ground Floor Lobby Work or the Ceiling and Carpet which continues for more than two (2) Business Days after Landlord’s notice thereof to Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p162">ARTICLE 6.</p>
          <p id="s1p163">USE</p>
          <p id="s1p164">A. Use. Subject to and to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, Tenant shall use the Premises for general office and administrative purposes, for research and development purposes, including computer labs, light assembly, shipping and receiving purposes, and for such other purposes as shall be permitted by applicable Laws and shall be consistent with the first class character of the Building and the Project, and for no other purpose whatsoever, subject to and in compliance with all other provisions of this Lease, including, without limitation, the Building’s Rules and Regulations attached as Exhibit B hereto. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and Regulations and the balance of this Lease, the balance of this Lease shall control. Landlord makes no representation or warranty that applicable Laws permit the Premises to be used for any of the foregoing specified purposes, and any restrictions or prohibitions on any such uses of the Premises shall not diminish Tenant’s obligation to pay Rent or perform Tenant’s other obligations under this Lease. Tenant and its invitees shall also have the non-exclusive right, along with other tenants of the Building and others authorized by Landlord, to use the Common Areas subject to such rules and regulations as Landlord in its discretion may impose from time to time. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give Tenant any exclusive use rights with respect to the Buildings or any other portion of the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p165">B. Restrictions. Tenant shall not at any time use or occupy or permit anyone to use or occupy, the Premises or do or permit anything to be done in the Premises which: (a) causes or is liable to cause injury to persons, to the Building or its equipment, facilities or systems; (b) impairs or tends to impair the character, reputation or appearance of the Building as a first class office building or the Project as a first class office project; (c) impairs or tends to impair the proper and economic maintenance, operation and repair of the Building or its equipment, facilities or systems; or (d) annoys or inconveniences or tends to annoy or inconvenience other tenants or occupants of the Building or the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p166">-13-</p>
          <p id="s1p167">C. Compliance with Laws. Tenant shall not permit the Premises to be used in violation of or in conflict with, and at its sole cost and expense shall promptly comply with, all Laws (including, without limitation, the ADA and Title 24 requirements) insofar as any thereof relate to or affect the condition, use or occupancy of the Premises (including Alterations therein), and Tenant shall perform all work to the Premises and other portions of the Project required to effect such compliance (or, at Landlord’s election, Landlord may perform such work to portions of the Project outside of the Premises at Tenant’s expense). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Tenant shall not be required to perform or pay for any changes to the Base Building Components (as defined in Article 12 below) unless such changes are related to or affected or triggered by (i) Tenant’s Alterations, including Tenant’s Work, (ii) Tenant’s particular use of the Premises (as opposed to Tenant’s use of the Premises as permitted hereunder in a normal and customary manner), (iii) Tenant’s particular employees or employment practices, The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Tenant in any actions against Tenant, whether Landlord be a party thereto or not, that Tenant has so violated any Law, shall be conclusive of such violation as between Landlord or Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p168">ARTICLE 7.</p>
          <p id="s1p169">SERVICES</p>
          <p id="s1p170">A. Utilities and Services. Subject to the final three sentences of this Section 7. A., Landlord shall furnish the Premises with sufficient quantities of water, electricity and gas required for the normal and customary use of the Premises as permitted hereunder, twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning services (“HVAC”) during Normal Business Hours or such extended hours as Tenant shall request (including twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week if so requested by Tenant) from time to time upon reasonable prior notice to Landlord. There shall be no after-hours charge or other charge to Tenant for HVAC service after Normal Business Hours, other than Tenant’s obligation to pay for the utilities consumed by reason thereof as hereinafter set forth. Prior to the Commencement Date, Landlord, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, shall cause the Premises to be separately sub-metered for electricity and gas (the “Meter Installation Work”), and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, within thirty (30) days after Landlord’s demand from time to time (which may be on a monthly basis), for the cost of electricity and gas consumed at the Premises as measured by such sub-meters. Such sub-meters shall exclude electricity and gas consumed by the cafeteria described in Section 7.B. below, and the costs of electricity, gas, water, and other utilities consumed by the cafeteria shall be included in Operating Expenses as set forth in said Section 7.B. below. Tenant acknowledges that water serving each of the Buildings is not separately metered, but rather measured by one water meter for all of the Buildings, and the costs of water so measured shall be allocated to each Building as an Operating Expense as provided in Section 29.L. below. Except as set forth above, Tenant shall arrange for all telephone, janitorial services, and other utilities and services which it shall require in connection with its use or occupancy of the Premises and shall pay for the same by direct payment to the provider thereof, together with any taxes, penalties, surcharges or the like pertaining thereto. Except as expressly provided above, Landlord shall have no obligation to furnish any utilities or services to the</p>
          <p id="s1p171">-14-</p>

Tenant shall be solely responsible for any supplemental HVAC to the Premises as Tenant shall require for the comfortable occupancy thereof, and Tenant shall also be responsible for the installation, maintenance and repair of any supplemental life safety systems required by reason of Tenant’s particular equipment or particular use or manner of use of the Premises. Except as provided pursuant to Section 12.B. below, Tenant shall maintain, repair and replace all such items, operate the same, and keep the same in good working order and condition. Tenant shall not install any equipment or fixtures, or use the same, so as to exceed the safe and lawful capacity of any utility equipment or lines serving the same. The installation, alteration, replacement or connection of any utility equipment and lines, and any other equipment or systems or Alterations which Tenant shall require in order to supply supplemental HVAC or other services, shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.C. above. Tenant shall ensure that all Tenant’s supplemental HVAC equipment, is installed and operated at all times in a manner to prevent roof leaks, damage, or noise due to vibrations or improper installation, maintenance or operation. Tenant shall obtain, at its expense all electric light bulbs, ballasts and tubes as it shall require for the Premises. Landlord shall not be liable for any damages directly or indirectly resulting from nor shall the Monthly Rent, Operating Expenses or any other monies owed by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease be abated or reduced by reason of (a) the installation, use or interruption of use of any equipment used in connection with the furnishing of any of the foregoing utilities and services, (b) failure to furnish or delay in furnishing any such utilities or services for any reason whatsoever, or (c) the limitation, curtailment, rationing or restriction on use of water, electricity, gas or any other form of energy or any other service or utility whatsoever serving the Premises or the Project. Landlord shall be entitled to cooperate voluntarily and in a reasonable manner with the efforts of national, state or local government agencies or utility suppliers in reducing energy or other resource consumption. Tenant’s utilization of utilities and services shall be subject to the limitations of any such voluntary, reasonable program that Landlord shall implement for the Project that does not require Tenant to spend any additional monies or modify Tenant’s business within the Premises as a result thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p173">B. Cafeteria. A cafeteria located in the Building is made available to Tenant and other tenants of the Project. The cafeteria is operated by a third party operator. The costs (including, without limitation, rental subsidies, if any, costs of electricity, gas, water and other utilities) associated with the cafeteria, whether operated by Landlord or a third party operator, shall in any event be included in Operating Expenses. The provisions of Article 9 shall fully apply in connection with use of the cafeteria by Tenant or any other Tenant Party (as defined in Article 9). Without limitation of the preceding sentence, Tenant shall hold Landlord and its agents, successors and assigns, including its Project Manager, harmless from and indemnify Landlord and its agents, successors and assigns, including its Project Manager, against any and all Claims (as defined in Article 9) to the extent arising from (a) the acts or omissions of Tenant or any other Tenant Party in, on or about the cafeteria, or (b) any accident, injury or damage, howsoever and by whomsoever caused, to any Tenant Party, occurring in, on or about the cafeteria, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord. Landlord may prescribe rules and regulations for the use of the cafeteria, including, without limitation, with respect to reservations for meetings and other functions. Tenant’s use of the cafeteria shall be conditioned upon Tenant’s observance of such rules and regulations. Tenant acknowledges that the cafeteria may, from time to time, be temporarily closed during the Term including, without limitation, closures due to (i) remodeling, improvement work or repair work, (ii) changes in the</p>

          <p id="s1p175">cafeteria operator, (iii) cessation of operations by the cafeteria operator, (iv) compliance with applicable Law, (v) casualty or condemnation and (vi) matters beyond Landlord’s reasonable control. Landlord shall use its good faith efforts to reasonably address and remediate any reasonable complaints by Tenant with respect to odors emitting from the cafeteria.</p>
          <p id="s1p176">C. Interruptions. Any interruption or discontinuance of utilities or the services and appurtenances described in this Article 7 or otherwise in this Lease shall not be deemed an eviction or disturbance of Tenant’s use and possession of the Premises, or any part thereof, nor render Landlord liable to Tenant for damages by abatement of the Rent or otherwise, nor relieve Tenant from performance of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1932(1) or any other applicable existing or future Law permitting the termination of this Lease due to such interruption or discontinuance.</p>
          <p id="s1p177">ARTICLE 8.</p>
          <p id="s1p178">INSURANCE</p>
          <p id="s1p179">A. Tenant’s Required Insurance. Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, shall maintain the following insurance coverages with responsible companies licensed to do business in the state where the Building is located and reasonably satisfactory to Landlord: (i) “special form” property insurance which shall be primary (and non-contributory) on any Alterations performed by or on behalf of Tenant and Tenant’s property, including, but not limited to, its goods, equipment and inventory, in an amount adequate to cover their full replacement cost; (ii) business interruption insurance for a period of not less than two hundred seventy (270) days, (iii) commercial general liability insurance on an as occurrence basis with limits of liability in an amount not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) combined single limit for each occurrence and Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) annual aggregate, in each case for bodily injury and property damage liability and personal injury liability, (iv) employer’s liability coverage of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, (v) Worker’s Compensation Insurance as required by Law, and (vi) any other form of forms of insurance as any Lender of Landlord may reasonably require from time to time in form, in amounts and for insurance risks against which a prudent tenant would protect itself and which is customarily required by lenders of landlords of similar buildings located in the vicinity of the Premises. The commercial general liability policy shall include contractual liability which includes the provisions of Article 9 herein, and contain severability of interest and cross liability clauses.</p>
          <p id="s1p180">On or before the Commencement Date, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord and its Project Manager, certificates and/or policies of insurance evidencing the aforesaid insurance coverages. All such policies and certificates (other than Worker’s Compensation Insurance) shall name as additional insureds Landlord, Landlord’s Project Manager, Tenant, any Lender of Landlord, and such other parties as Landlord shall reasonably require, as their respective interests may appear. Renewal certificates must be furnished to Landlord at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of such insurance policies showing the above coverage to be in full force and effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p181">All such insurance shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and provide that it cannot be canceled or reduced in coverage except upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Landlord.

          <p id="s1p183">B. Waiver of Subrogation. Landlord and Tenant each agree that neither Landlord nor Tenant will have any claim against the other for any loss or damage to property which is covered by the insurance carried by either party and for which recovery from such insurer is made (or for which recovery would be made if the party had carried the insurance required of it pursuant to this Lease), notwithstanding the negligence of either party in causing the loss. Each party hereto shall cause each property damage insurance policy obtained by it to provide that the insurance company waives all rights of recovery by way of subrogation against the other respective party in connection with any matter covered by such policy. For purposes hereof, any deductible amount shall be treated as though it were recoverable under such policies.</p>
          <p id="s1p184">C. Waiver of Claims. Except for claims arising from Landlord’s willful misconduct (but subject, as to such excepted claims, to Section 8.B. above), Tenant waives all claims against Landlord for injury or death to persons, damage to property or to any other interest of Tenant sustained by Tenant or any party claiming, through Tenant resulting from: (i) any occurrence in or upon the Premises, (ii) leaking of roofs, bursting, stoppage or leaking of water, gas, sewer or steam pipes or equipment, including sprinklers, (iii) wind, rain, snow, ice, flooding, freezing, fire, explosion, earthquake, excessive heat or cold, or other casualty, (iv) the Building, Premises, or the operating and mechanical systems or equipment of the Building, being defective, or failing, and (v) vandalism, malicious mischief, theft or other acts or omissions of any other parties including without limitation, other tenants, contractors and invitees at the Building. Tenant agrees that Tenant’s property loss risks shall be borne by its insurance, and Tenant agrees to look solely to and seek recovery only from its insurance carriers in the event of such losses.</p>
          <p id="s1p185">D. Landlord’s Required Insurance. Landlord shall obtain and keep in full force and effect during the Term, at its own cost and expense (i) commercial general liability insurance to afford protection against any and all claims for personal injury, death or property damage occurring in or upon the Common Areas or any part thereof, in such amounts as Landlord shall reasonably determine; and (ii) insurance covering the Project, excluding footings and foundations, against loss or damage by fire and such other risks and hazards as are insured under then available standard forms of fire insurance policies (excluding, at Landlord’s option, perils such as earthquake, terrorism, flood and other standard “special form” policy exclusions), for the full insurable value thereof as determined by Landlord; in each such case with deductible amounts reasonably determined by Landlord.</p>

          <p id="s1p191">Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any damage by or from any act or negligence of any co-tenant or other occupant of the Building, or by any owner or occupants of adjoining or contiguous property. Landlord shall not be liable for any injury or damage to persons or property resulting in whole or in part from the criminal activities or willful misconduct of others. To the extent not covered by Landlord’s special form property insurance, Tenant agrees to pay for all damage to the Building, as well as all damage to persons or property of other tenants or occupants thereof, caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or any Tenant Parties. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to relieve Landlord from liability for any personal injury resulting from its gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, Landlord shall not be liable for any consequential damages or interruption or loss of business, income or profits, nor shall Landlord be liable for loss of or damage to artwork, currency, jewelry, unique or valuable documents, securities or other valuables, or for other property not in the nature of ordinary fixtures, furnishings and equipment.

In the event the Premises or any substantial part of the Building is wholly or partially damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty which is fully covered by Landlord’s insurance and for which such insurance proceeds are made available to Landlord by its Lender, Landlord will proceed to restore the same to substantially the same condition existing immediately prior to such damage or destruction unless such damage or destruction is incapable of repair or restoration within two hundred ten (210) days from the date of the fire or other casualty (or ninety (90) days if the fire or other casualty occurs during the final one hundred eighty (180) days of the Term), as determined by Landlord, in which event Landlord may, at Landlord’s option and by written notice given to Tenant within sixty (60) days of such damage or destruction, declare this Lease terminated as of the happening of such damage or destruction. If in Landlord’s reasonable opinion the net insurance proceeds recovered by Landlord and made available by Landlord’s Lender by reason of the damage or destruction will not be adequate to complete the restoration of the Building, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease and all unaccrued obligations</p>

Landlord shall reasonably determine the amount of damaged or useless space and the square footage of the Premises referenced in the prior sentence.</p>

In the event of a taking or condemnation of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the Building and without regard to whether the Premises are part of such taking or condemnation, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease by giving notice to Tenant within sixty (60) days of Landlord receiving notice of such condemnation. All compensation awarded for any condemnation or taking shall be the property of Landlord, whether such damages shall be awarded as a compensation for diminution in the value of the leasehold or to the fee of the Premises, and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all of Tenant’s right, title and interest in and to any and all such compensation; provided, however that in the event this Lease is terminated as to any portion of the Premises, Tenant shall be entitled to make a separate claim for the taking of Tenant’s personal property (including fixtures paid for by Tenant), and for costs of moving. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any condemnation or taking award to Tenant shall be available only to the extent such award is payable separately to Tenant and does not diminish the award available to Landlord or any Lender of Landlord and such award shall be limited to the amount of Rent actually paid by Tenant to Landlord for the period of time for which the award is given. Any additional portion of such award shall belong to Landlord. In the event of a partial taking of the Premises which does not result in a termination of this Lease in its entirety, the Monthly Rent, Tenant’s Share and Project Share hereunder shall be equitably reduced.</p>

In the event of attornment, no Lender shall be: (i) liable for any act or omission of Landlord, or subject to any offsets or defenses which Tenant might have against Landlord (prior to such Lender becoming Landlord under such attornment), (ii) liable for any security deposit or bound by any prepaid Rent not actually received by such Lender, or (iii) obligated to complete any alterations or improvements to be performed by Landlord or Tenant hereunder, or to pay for or otherwise disburse any tenant improvement allowance or other funds towards any alterations or improvements to be performed by Tenant hereunder, or (iv) bound by any modification of this Lease after the date of the Lender’s Mortgage not consented to by such Lender. Any Lender may elect to make this Lease prior to the lien of its Mortgage, and if the Lender under any prior Mortgage shall require, this Lease shall be prior to any subordinate Mortgage; such elections shall be effective upon written notice to Tenant. Upon request of any such Lender or purchaser, including any such request made by reason of the termination of this Lease as a result of such foreclosure or other proceedings, Tenant shall enter into a new lease with such Lender or purchaser on the terms and conditions of this Lease applicable to the remainder of the term hereof. Tenant agrees to give any Lender by certified mail, return receipt requested, or overnight delivery service, a copy of any notice of default served by Tenant upon Landlord, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been notified in writing (by way of service on Tenant of a copy of an assignment of leases, or otherwise) of the name and address of such Lender. Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within the time permitted Landlord for cure under this Lease, any such Lender whose address has been so provided to Tenant shall have an additional period of thirty (30) days in which to cure (or such additional time as may be required due to causes beyond such Lender’s control, including time to obtain possession of the Building by power of sale or judicial action or deed in lieu of foreclosure). The provisions of this Article shall be self-operative; however, Tenant shall execute such documentation as Landlord or any Lender may request from time to time in order to confirm the matters set forth in this Article in recordable form. To the extent not expressly prohibited by Law, Tenant waives the provisions of any Law now or hereafter adopted which may give or purport to give Tenant any right or election to terminate or otherwise adversely affect this Lease or Tenant’s obligations hereunder if such foreclosure or power of sale proceedings are initiated, prosecuted or completed.</p>

In the event of any such subletting, rents received by Landlord from such subletting shall be applied (i) first, to the payment of the costs of maintaining, preserving, altering and preparing the Premises for subletting, the other costs of subletting, including but not limited to brokers’ commissions, attorneys’ fees and expenses of removal of Tenant’s personal property, trade fixtures and Alterations; (ii) second, to the payment of rent then due and payable hereunder; (iii) third, to the payment of future rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder; (iv) fourth, the balance, if any, shall be paid to Tenant upon (but not before) expiration of the term of this Lease.</p>

The proceeds of any such sale shall be applied first to the payment of the expenses for removal and storage of the property, the preparation for and the conducting of such sale, and for attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses incurred by Landlord in connection therewith, and the balance shall be applied as provided in Section 2 above.</p>

Tenant’s failure to deliver any replacement, additional or extension of the Letter of Credit, or evidence of renewal of the Letter of Credit, within the time specified under this Lease shall entitle Landlord to draw upon the Letter of Credit then in effect and, at Landlord’s election, constitute a default under this Lease. If Landlord liquidates the Letter of Credit as provided in the preceding sentence, Landlord shall hold the funds received from the Letter of Credit as security for Tenant’s performance under this Lease, and Landlord shall not be required to segregate such security deposit from its other funds and no interest shall accrue or be payable to Tenant with respect thereto. No holder of a Mortgage, nor any purchaser at any judicial or private foreclosure sale of the Project or any portion thereof, shall be responsible to Tenant for such security deposit unless and only to the extent such holder or purchaser shall have actually received the same. If Tenant is not in default at the expiration or termination of this Lease, Landlord shall return to Tenant the Letter of Credit or the balance of the security deposit then held by Landlord, as applicable; provided, however, that in no event shall any such return be construed as an admission by Landlord that Tenant has performed all of its covenants and obligations hereunder. Tenant hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives the benefits and protections of California Civil Code Section 1950.7, and, without limitation of the scope of such waiver, acknowledges that Landlord may use all or any part of the Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof to compensate Landlord for damages resulting from termination of this Lease and the tenancy created hereunder (including, without limitation, damages recoverable under California Civil Code Section 1951.2).</p>

Any taxes which shall be levied on the rentals of the Project shall be determined as if the Project were Landlord’s only property, and provided further that in no event shall the term “taxes or assessment,” as used herein, include any net federal or state income taxes levied or assessed on Landlord, unless such taxes are a specific substitute for real property taxes. Such term shall, however, include gross taxes on rentals. Expenses incurred by Landlord for tax consultants and in contesting the amount or validity of any such taxes or assessments shall be included in such computations.

For the purposes of this Lease, any special assessments shall be deemed payable in such number of installments as is permitted by Law, whether or not actually so paid. If as of the Commencement Date the Project has not been fully assessed as a completed project, for the purpose of computing the Expenses for any adjustment required herein or under Article 4, the Tax shall be adjusted by Landlord, as of the date on which the adjustment is to be made, to reflect full completion of the Project including all standard tenant finish work if the method of taxation of real estate prevailing to the time of execution hereof shall be, or has been altered, so as to cause the whole or any part of the taxes now, hereafter or theretofore levied, assessed or imposed on real estate to be levied, assessed or imposed on Landlord, wholly or partially, as a capital levy or otherwise, or on or measured by the rents received therefrom, then such new or altered taxes attributable to the Project shall be included within the term Taxes, except that the same shall not include any enhancement of said tax attributable to other income of Landlord.

Any judgments rendered against Landlord shall be satisfied solely out of proceeds of sale of Landlord’s interest in the Building and, subject to the prior rights of any Lenders and to the extent still in Landlord’s possession or not yet received (but still receivable), the revenues, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards therefrom. No personal judgment shall lie against Landlord upon extinguishment of its rights in the Building and, subject to the prior rights of any Lenders and to the extent still in Landlord’s possession or not yet received (but still receivable), the revenues, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards therefrom, and any judgments so rendered shall not give rise to any right of execution or levy against Landlord’s assets. The provisions hereof shall inure to Landlord’s successors and assigns including any Lender. The foregoing provisions are not intended to relieve Landlord from the performance of any of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, but only to limit the personal liability of Landlord in case of recovery of a judgment against Landlord; nor shall the foregoing be deemed to limit Tenant’s rights to obtain injunctive relief or specific performance or other remedy which may be accorded Tenant by law or under this Lease.</p>

The “prevailing party” will be determined by the court before whom the action was brought based upon an assessment of which party’s major arguments or positions taken in the suit or proceeding could fairly be said to have prevailed over the other party’s major arguments or positions on major disputed issues in the court’s decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Landlord shall be deemed the prevailing party in any unlawful detainer or other action or proceeding instituted by Landlord based upon any default or alleged default of Tenant hereunder if (i) judgment is entered in favor of Landlord, or (ii) prior to trial or judgment Tenant pays all or any portion of the rent claimed by Landlord, vacates the Premises, or otherwise cures the default claimed by Landlord.</p>
