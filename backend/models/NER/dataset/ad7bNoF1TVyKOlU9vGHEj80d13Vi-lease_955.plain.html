Such additional rent by reason of tax increases shall be payable by Tenant upon presentation to Tenant of copies of paid tax statements for the base year and for the year for which payment is demanded. The proportion of such increase payable by the Tenant shall be based on the ratio which the number of rentable square feet of area occupied by the Tenant in the building bears to the total number of rentable square feet of area in the entire building (Tenant's Proportionate Share). If the term of this lease shall commence or terminate other than on the first or last day of a calendar year, Tenant shall pay for said calendar year, that portion of such increases in taxes, if any, proportionate to the number of months of tenancy during such year.

          <p id="s1p13">d.During the second and succeeding calendar years Tenant shall pay monthly in advance, as additional rent for each such calendar year (or to the expiration date of this lease, whichever first occurs), an amount per month equal to one-twelfth (1/12th) of Tenant's Proportionate Share of Landlord's estimated Operating Expenses for said calendar year over the Base Amount. The amount of such additional rent not determined at the beginning of any calendar year shall be brought current by Tenant with fifteen (15) days after the amount is determined. If by reason of such advance monthly payments Tenant shall have paid in excess of its Proportionate Share of excess Operating Expenses for the fiscal year, Landlord will, when the amount of Operating Expenses for such calendar year is determined, reimburse Tenant the amount of the excess paid. Should Landlord fail to pay Tenant the excess paid within thirty (30) days, then Tenant shall be entitled to credits in base rent until such time that the credit has been offset from base rent. If it is determined that Tenant has not paid Tenant's Proportionate Share in full by reason of such advance monthly payments, then Tenant will pay the difference in one lump sum within fifteen (15) days after receipt of Landlord's statement.</p>
