          <p id="s1p71">BASE YEAR OPERATING EXPENSES</p>
          <p id="s1p72">ADDITIONAL RENT — OPERATING EXPENSE PASS THROUGHS. For the calendar year commencing on January 1, 2005 and for each calendar year thereafter, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, Tenant’s Proportionate Share of any increase in Operating Expenses (as hereinafter defined) incurred by Landlord’s operation or maintenance of the Building during calendar year 2004 (the “Base Year”). Tenant’s Proportionate Share shall be calculated by dividing the approximately 19,245 rentable square feet of the Premises by the approximately 91,000 net rentable square feet of the Building, which equals 21.15%. If during any calendar year the occupancy of the rentable area of the Building is less than full, then Operating Expenses (as hereinafter defined) will be adjusted for such calendar year at a rate of 95% occupancy.</p>
          <p id="s1p73">As used herein, the term “Operating Expenses” shall mean direct costs of operation, repair and maintenance as determined by standard accounting practices, including, but not limited to ad valorem real and personal property taxes, hazard and liability insurance premiums, utilities, heat, air conditioning, janitorial service, labor, materials, supplies, equipment and tools, permits, licenses, inspection fees, management fees (but not including the cost of management personnel above the level of Property Manager), and common area expenses; provided, however, the term “Operating Expenses” shall not include depreciation on the Building or equipment therein, interest, executive salaries, real estate brokers’ commissions, or other expenses that do not relate to the operation of the Building. The annual statement of Operating Expenses shall be accounted for and reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (the “Annual Statement”). “Operating Expenses” shall not include more than a five (5%) percent annual increase in “controllable Operating Expenses” from one calendar year to the next. For purposes of this Addendum, “controllable Operating Expenses” are defined as and limited to the following expenses only: (1) the salaries of onsite personnel in the direct employment of the Landlord or its property manager who perform operational, repair or maintenance activities in connection with the Building; and (2) the compensation rate for the Landlord’s property manager. For the purposes of calculating the Base Year expenses and any increase in Tenant’s Operating Expenses, Landlord acknowledges and agrees that the property management fees charged to Tenant by the Landlord shall be capped annually at three (3%) percent of the gross rental income for the Building.</p>
          <p id="s1p74">For the calendar year commencing on January 1, 2005 and for each calendar year thereafter during the Term, Landlord shall estimate the amount the Operating Expenses shall increase for such calendar year above the Operating Expenses incurred during the Base Year. Landlord shall send to Tenant a written statement of the amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of any</p>
          <p id="s1p75">7</p>
          <p id="s1p76">estimated increase in Operating Expenses and Tenant shall pay to Landlord, monthly as Additional Rent, Tenant’s Proportionate Share of such increase in Operating Expenses. Within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar year, Landlord shall send a copy of the Annual Statement to Tenant.

          <p id="s1p77">Provided no default by Tenant is then outstanding, Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense (except as stated below), shall have the right, to be exercised by written notice given to Landlord within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord’s Annual Statement, for the preceding calendar year, to audit Landlord’s books</p>
          <p id="s1p78">and records pertaining to such Operating Expenses, provided such audit commences within thirty (30) days after Tenant’s notice to Landlord and thereafter proceeds regularly and continuously to conclusion, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following commencement of the audit, and, provided further, that such audit does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of Landlord’s business, and provided, further, that such audit shall be performed either by Tenant or a certified public accounting firm but specifically not by any firm the compensation of which is on a contingent basis. Landlord agrees to cooperate in good faith with Tenant in the conduct of any such audit. To the extent such audit reveals an underpayment or over payment by Tenant of Operating Expenses, Landlord and Tenant shall promptly make the appropriate adjustments for said over payment or underpayment to be paid to the other party. If any such audit reveals that the amount of Operating Expenses billed to Tenant is more than five percent (5%) in excess of Tenant’s Share of actual Operating Expenses, then Landlord shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Tenant in connection with such audit. Tenant agrees on behalf of Tenant, its employees and agents (including any entity conducting such audit) that any and all information obtained from Landlord’s records, as well as the results of any audit, shall be held in confidence and shall not be disclosed to any third party except as may be specifically required for the limited purpose of enforcing Tenant’s rights under the Lease.</p>

This Exhibit B (the “Workletter”) sets forth the rights and obligations of Landlord and Tenant with respect to space planning, engineering, final workshop drawings, and the construction and installation of any improvements to the Premises to be completed prior to the Expansion Space Commencement Date (“Tenant Improvements”). This Workletter contemplates that the performance of this work will proceed in four stages in accordance with the following schedule: (i) preparation of a space plan; (ii) final design and engineering and preparation of final plans and working drawings; (iii) preparation by the Contractor (as hereinafter defined) of an estimate of the additional cost of the initial Tenant Improvements; (iv) submission and approval of plans by appropriate governmental authorities and construction and installation of the Tenant Improvements by the Expansion Space Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p83">In consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter contained, Landlord and Tenant do mutually agree to the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p84">1. Landlord agrees to provide an allowance of up to $194,000.00, to design, engineer, install, supply and otherwise to construct the Tenant Improvements in the Premises that will become a part of the Building (the “Allowance”).

          <p id="s1p91">Landlord shall have sole and absolute discretion to approve or disapprove any improvements that will be visible to the exterior of the Premises, or which may affect the structural integrity of the Building. Any approval of the Plans by Landlord shall not constitute approval of any Delays caused by Tenant and shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights or remedies that may arise as a result of such Delays. Landlord may condition its approval of the Plans if: (i) the Plans require design elements or materials that would cause Landlord to deliver the Premises to Tenant after the scheduled Commencement Date, or (ii) the estimated cost for any improvements under the Plan is more than the Allowance.</p>

Tenant will be notified of the cost and any delays that would result from the change by a change order signed by Tenant before the changes are implemented.
