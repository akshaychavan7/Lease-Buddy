Tenant shall have, as appurtenant to the Premises, the right to use in common with others, if any, entitled thereto (i) the common areas and common facilities, if any, included in the Building, on the Lot or in the Complex, (ii) the building service fixtures and equipment serving the Premises, and (iii) subject to Section 10.14 hereof, (a) the right to use that number of nonreserved parking spaces determined by dividing the Rentable Square Footage (as the same shall be determined pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof and as the same may be increased pursuant to Section 10.11 hereof) by 500 (&quot;Tenant's Parking Spaces&quot;) in the underground parking garage located south of Kendall Street as shown on Exhibit A hereto (the &quot;Garage&quot;) and (b) the right to use that number of nonreserved Valet Parking Spaces, as such term is defined and such number is determined pursuant to Section 10.14 hereof. To the extent that the Premises includes all of the rentable square footage on a particular floor of the Building, Tenant shall have exclusive use of the common areas on such floors, but Landlord shall have the rights set forth in the next paragraph hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p326">Landlord reserves the right from time to time, without unreasonable interference with Tenant's use, (a) to install, repair, replace, use, maintain and relocate for service to the Premises and to other parts of the Building, or either, building service fixtures and equipment wherever located in the Building, including the perimeter walls of the Premises, on the roof of the Building, in mechanical penthouses and in any space in or adjacent to the Premises used for shafts, stacks, pipes, conduits, wires and appurtenant fixtures, ducts, electric or other utilities, telecommunications equipment or other Building facilities, as well as the right of access (which right of access shall be at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, except in the case of emergency) through the Premises for the purpose of operation, maintenance and repair, provided, however, that the Annual Fixed Rent, Additional Rent (as defined in Section 4.2 hereof) and other charges payable hereunder by Tenant shall be proportionally reduced in the event that any such installation or relocation of service materially reduces the usable floor area of the Premises (other than a temporary reduction to accommodate installation, repair, replacement, maintenance and relocation of such service); notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (a), to the extent that the Premises include all of the rentable square footage on a particular floor of the Building, Landlord's right to install, repair, replace, use, maintain and relocate such building service fixtures and equipment on such floor of the Building shall be limited to placing or installing such building service fixtures and equipment in shafts, pipes, stacks, conduits, chases and risers located within the central core common area of such floor or in such other locations on such floor as may be set forth in the Final Design Documents; (b) to construct, alter or relocate any Building Common Areas and/or Complex Common Areas (provided that, except for any construction, alteration or relocation of Complex Common Areas required or permitted by the Development Approvals or Subsequent Approvals, no such construction, alteration or relocation of any such Complex Common Areas shall substantially or materially increase any payments due from Tenant under this Lease and any such construction, alteration or relocation shall be substantially similar in quality and utility to Complex Common Areas being altered or relocated or substantially similar to common areas of first-class, mixed use projects in the Relevant Market); and (c) after construction of the Building to construct, alter or relocate any Building Common Areas, subject to approval by Tenant, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.</p>

Accordingly, after completion of construction of the Base Building Improvements, Landlord will notify Tenant of the Rentable Square Footage of the Premises, the Expansion Spaces and the Building, all of which shall be measured by Landlord's Architect in accordance with the ANSI/BOMA Z65.1-1996 Standard Method for Measuring Building Rentable Area, approved June 7, 1996 for a single tenant building. Landlord's Architect's measurement shall be subject to review and approval by Tenant's Architect for conformity to the foregoing standard. If necessary, Landlord and Tenant will execute an amendment to this Lease modifying the definitions of Rentable Square Footage of Premises, Rentable Square Footage of Building, the location in the Building of the Premises and the Expansion Spaces, Tenant's Proportionate Fraction for Building, Tenant's Proportionate Fraction for Complex, Initial Estimated Annual Additional Rent for Building, Initial Estimated Annual Additional Rent for Complex, and such other terms and provisions, if any, of this Lease as may be necessary to reflect such actual measurements. Landlord and Tenant will also execute, upon request of either, a certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit A-3 hereto, acknowledging, inter alia, the Commencement Date of this Lease as provided for in Section 2.2 hereof, after such Commencement Date has occurred (as described in Section 3.2 hereof), and the Rentable Square Footage of the Building, the Premises and the Expansion Spaces. After such measurement by Landlord's Architect, the Premises, the Expansion Spaces and the Building shall not be subject to remeasurement without the consent of Landlord and Tenant. Anything in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, the Premises, as initially demised, shall include all of the Rentable Square Footage in the Building other than the Expansion Spaces and the Retail Space. &quot;Tenant's Proportionate Fraction for Building&quot; shall be the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the Rentable Square Footage of Premises, including the Expansion Spaces and any ROFR Space (from and after the dates on which each of the Expansion Spaces or any ROFR Space is demised to Tenant), to the Rentable Square Footage of Building. &quot;Tenant's Proportionate Fraction for Complex&quot; shall be the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the Rentable Square Footage of the Premises, including the Expansion Spaces and any ROFR Space, when applicable, to the Rentable Square Footage of all buildings (other than any garages in the Complex and any building or portion thereof which is not available for lease such as an information kiosk), including the Building, which Landlord is permitted to develop in the Complex pursuant to the PUD Approval. Landlord shall have the right to estimate on a good faith basis, from time to time, the Rentable Square Footage of all such buildings prior to the construction thereof. From time to time after construction of each building in the Complex, Landlord shall notify Tenant of the Rentable Square Footage of such buildings and shall provide to Tenant, upon Tenant's request, such information as Tenant may reasonably request with respect to the calculation thereof. Within thirty (30) days after notice of such Rentable Square Footage, Tenant shall pay to Landlord or Landlord shall credit to Additional Rent next due from Tenant, as applicable, any underpayment owed or overpayment made, as applicable, by Tenant based upon the estimated Rentable Square Footage of such buildings, on account of Tenant's Proportionate Fraction for Complex of taxes and assessments and Tenant's Proportionate Fraction for Complex of the Annual Complex Maintenance and Operation Charge and the actual Rentable Square Footage of such buildings.</p>

          <p id="s1p337">Landlord has initiated a design competition for the Building as more fully set forth in a letter dated January 17, 2000 from David Clem of Lyme Properties, LLC to Henri Termeer, President and CEO of Tenant (the &quot;Design Process Letter&quot;), which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate in connection with the design competition as set forth in the Design Process Letter. Upon completion of such design competition, Landlord and Tenant shall mutually select Landlord's Architect (for purposes of this Lease the term &quot;Landlord's Design Team&quot; shall be deemed to refer not only to Landlord's Architect but also to the principal engineers, architects and other design consultants employed by Landlord or Landlord's Architect for the design and construction of the Building) and Landlord's Design Team (to the extent then identified). Landlord and Tenant shall also mutually establish and agree upon (i) a preliminary design concept for the Building (the &quot;Preliminary Design Concept&quot;), which shall be based upon Tenant's program, outline building specifications, schedule requirements, and (ii) a preliminary hard and soft cost budget for the Base Building Improvements (the &quot;preliminary Project Cost budget&quot;). Such selection of Tenant's Architect and Landlord's Design Team (to the extent then identified), the establishment and agreement upon the Preliminary Design Concept and the establishment and agreement upon such preliminary Project Cost budget shall be made by the respective dates for each set forth in the progress schedule attached as Exhibit B hereto (the &quot;Progress Schedule&quot;). Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that the Progress Schedule represents a good faith estimate of the respective dates upon which the items set forth in the Progress Schedule are to occur but that the Progress Schedule is subject to finalization by Landlord and Tenant upon selection of Landlord's Architect and Landlord's Contractor. Accordingly, references in this Lease to the Progress Schedule shall mean the Progress Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit B as the same may be finalized. The Preliminary Design Concept shall describe the general scope and quality of the Building and shall identify those portions of the Building which will constitute the Premises initially leased to Tenant and the Expansion Spaces. If despite the diligent and good faith efforts of Landlord and Tenant the parties are unable to mutually select Landlord's Architect, to establish a mutually acceptable Preliminary Design Concept and/or a mutually acceptable preliminary Project Cost budget by the applicable dates set forth in the Progress Schedule, either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other party. During such thirty (30) day period Landlord and Tenant shall use diligent and good faith efforts to select such Architect, establish such Preliminary Design Concept and/or preliminary Project Cost budget, as applicable, failing which this Lease shall terminate on the date set forth in such notice. In the event of such termination, all third party, out-of-pocket costs incurred by Landlord in connection with the design competition and design process solely for the Building shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p338">Landlord and Tenant also agree to cooperate in good faith in connection with the design of the Building and the Base Building Improvements and the development of a mutually acceptable Final Project Budget (as defined below). Neither Landlord nor Tenant shall be required to approve any Design Documents unless the Building includes at least 285,000 r.s.f. of office space and at least 15,000 r.s.f. of ground floor retail space and each Expansion Space includes approximately 25,000 r.s.f. of contiguous space on a single floor of the Building. The size, layout, design and base building fit-up of the Building and Base Building Improvements and the Final Project Budget shall be mutually agreed</p>

Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that during design development process contemplated hereby, Tenant, with Landlord's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall have the right to approve and/or design base building electrical, mechanical, HVAC and other systems and design specifications (such as, by way of example, entranceway and lobby design, internal stair location, elevator size and finish, location of electrical and telecom rooms and equipment, location of mechanical shaftways and equipment, structural bay spaces, window mullions spacing and sill depth and height, floor to floor heights and the like), provided that the specifications for such base building elements are equal or better than the quality of the specifications therefor in a newly constructed, first-class office tower in Cambridge.</p>
          <p id="s1p341">Each party acknowledges and agrees that it is in its best interest for the Substantial Completion Date to occur on or before the Scheduled Substantial Completion Date and that the Final Project Budget be substantially consistent with the preliminary Project Cost budget and the updates thereto. Accordingly, each party hereby agrees that it shall keep the other party informed of the progress and status of its efforts to achieve the various milestones and other scheduled completion dates set forth on the Progress Schedule; and that if either party concludes that a milestone or other scheduled completion date will not be met, such party shall use reasonable efforts to notify the other party of the occurrence of any act, event, condition, omission or circumstance which could have a substantial or material impact on: (i) the ability to achieve the various milestone and other scheduled completion dates set forth on the Progress Schedule; (ii) the cost or financial viability of the construction of the Building or Complex; or (iii) Tenant's use and occupancy of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p342">After Landlord's Architect and the Landlord's Design Team have been selected and Landlord and Tenant have mutually established the Preliminary Design Concept, Landlord shall enter into a contract (the &quot;Architect's Contract&quot;) with Landlord's Architect. The Architect's Contract shall be subject to Tenant's prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Architect's Contract shall include provisions requiring Landlord's Architect to submit all Design Documents (as hereinafter defined) for each stage in the design process simultaneously to both Landlord and Tenant sufficiently prior to the applicable Design Document completion date for such design stage set forth in the Progress Schedule, in order to provide Landlord and Tenant with reasonably sufficient time (in any event not less than ten (10) business days for initial review of the applicable Design Document) following receipt of such submission to review, comment on and approve such submission prior to such completion date, to be responsible for the adequacy, accuracy and completeness of the Final Design Documents approved by Landlord and Tenant, and to cause the Final Design Documents to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, building codes, building design standards, the Development Approvals, Subsequent Approvals, agreed upon floor loading limits, and with respect to all materials, equipment and special designs, processes or products, that the same do not infringe any patent or other proprietary rights of others. Contemporaneously with the selection of Landlord's Architect, Landlord shall retain a construction manager or similar consultant (the &quot;Construction Cost Estimator&quot;), reasonably satisfactory to the Tenant, to work with and provide pre-construction services for Landlord, Tenant and Landlord's Architect to develop, and provide value engineering services to control, a preliminary Project Cost budget and updates thereto during the Schematic Design Documents phase and the Design Development Documents phase. The parties acknowledge that Landlord may, subject to Tenant's reasonable approval, elect, at any time, to hire such Construction Cost Estimator as Construction Manager/General Contractor for the Building. Subject to the limitations hereafter set forth with respect to Tenant's right to disapprove bids with respect to the Construction Contract, each of Landlord and Tenant shall have the right to approve such preliminary Project Cost budget and updates thereto, which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.</p>
          <p id="s1p343">Landlord shall cause Landlord's Architect to prepare schematic architectural plans, structural and engineering plans, elevations and building sections, and site plans for the Building based upon the</p>
          <p id="s1p344">15</p>
          <p id="s1p345">Preliminary Design Concept (&quot;Schematic Design Documents&quot;), which shall mean a conceptual design of the Base Building Improvements illustrating the scale and relationship of the components of the Base Building Improvements and calculating the gross floor area and Rentable Square Footage of the Building. Additionally, the Construction Cost Estimator shall prepare an updated budget for the Base Building Improvements for approval by Landlord and Tenant. The Schematic Design Documents shall show walkways and plazas for the Building and Lot, major landscape features, hardscaping, scale and relationship of other major components of the Building and Lot, pedestrian and vehicular (including service) access and flow through the Lot, lighting, survey information such as existing elevations, benchmarks and utilities, and any known construction limits. The Schematic Design Documents shall also include models, color renderings and outline specifications indicating all basic materials and systems of the proposed Base Building Improvements. The Schematic Design Documents and all subsequent Design Documents shall be prepared and distributed by Landlord's Architect in both hard copy and electronic format.</p>
          <p id="s1p346">During the development of the Schematic Design Documents, Landlord and Tenant shall meet with representatives of the CDD (as defined in Section 3.1.4 hereof) and their respective consultants to review and refine the design of the Building and the Lot. Thereafter, Landlord shall seek approval of the Schematic Design Documents by the Planning Board (as defined in Section 3.1.4 hereof), and Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in connection therewith. If despite the good faith efforts of Landlord and Tenant the Planning Board rejects the design reflected in the Schematic Design Documents or insists upon major changes to the Schematic Design Documents which are unacceptable to either Landlord or Tenant and if as a result thereof Landlord is unable to obtain approval of the Schematic Design Documents by the Planning Board by the date set forth in the Progress Schedule, as the same may be changed by any Tenant Delay, either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days prior written notice. If Planning Board approval of the Schematic Design Documents is not obtained by the end of such thirty-day period, this Lease shall thereupon terminate. In the event of such termination, all third party, out-of-pocket costs incurred by Landlord in connection with the design competition and design process solely for the Building and Lot shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant. Planning Board approval of the Schematic Design Documents shall be a Subsequent Approval (as defined in Section 3.1.4 hereof). Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate in connection with any conditions imposed by the Planning Board in connection with the Planning Board's approval of the Schematic Design Documents, such as further review of the Design Documents by the CDD.</p>
          <p id="s1p347">At such time as the Schematic Design Documents have been approved by Landlord and Tenant (and by the Planning Board, if Landlord elects to have the Schematic Design Documents approved by the Planning Board), Landlord shall cause (i) Landlord's Architect to prepare further details and development of the Schematic Design Documents (the &quot;Design Development Documents&quot;) for the Building and the Base Building Improvements, which shall mean plans, sections and elevations, typical construction details, and equipment layouts showing the scope, relationships, forms, size and appearance of the Base Building Improvements and calculating the gross floor area and the Rentable Square Footage of the Building and (ii) the Construction Cost Estimator, based upon such Design Development Documents, to prepare an updated budget for the Base Building Improvements, each for approval by Landlord and Tenant. Design Development Documents shall include architectural, mechanical and electrical drawings and details of the Building, exterior materials to be incorporated in the Building, walkways and other plaza areas on the Lot, a site and landscape plan for the Lot showing all site development and landscape detail for lighting, paving, landscaping, utilities, grading, drainage, access and service areas. The Design Development Documents shall also include outline specifications indicating all basic materials and mechanical and electrical systems of the proposed Base Building Improvements. As with the Schematic Development Documents, the Design Development Documents shall be prepared and distributed in both hard copy and electronic format.</p>
          <p id="s1p348">16</p>
          <p id="s1p349">At such time as the Design Development Documents have been approved by Landlord and Tenant, Landlord shall cause (i) Landlord's Architect to prepare detailed construction drawings and specifications (&quot;Final Design Documents&quot;) which shall set forth in detail the requirements for construction of Landlord's Work (including all architectural, mechanical, electrical and structural drawings and detailed specifications), shall be fully coordinated with one another and with field conditions as they exist on the Lot, shall show all work necessary to complete Landlord's Work, including all cutting, fitting, and patching and all connections to the mechanical and electrical systems and components of the Base Building Improvements, and shall include calculations of the gross floor area and the Rentable Square Footage of the Base Building Improvements and (ii) the Construction Cost Estimator, based upon such Final Design Documents, to prepare an updated budget for the Base Building Improvements, each for approval by Landlord and Tenant. The Final Design Documents shall be used for the construction of the Base Building Improvements and shall be based upon the Design Development Documents and other information which is relevant to the design and construction of the Base Building Improvements. The Final Design Documents shall be prepared and stamped by Landlord's Architect. The Preliminary Design Concept, the Schematic Design Documents and the Final Design Documents (collectively, the &quot;Design Documents&quot;) shall not include any of Tenant's Work (as hereinafter defined). As used herein, the term &quot;Base Building Improvements&quot; shall mean the items of work and materials to be performed and supplied by Landlord in accordance with the Final Design Documents as affected by Change Orders (as such term is hereafter defined) and the term &quot;Landlord's Work&quot; shall mean the construction of the Base Building Improvements in accordance with the Final Design Documents as affected by Change Orders.</p>
          <p id="s1p350">The preliminary and final Schematic Design Documents, the preliminary and final Design Development Documents, and the Final Design Documents shall be submitted to both Landlord and Tenant for review and comment in accordance with the dates and requirements included in the Progress Schedule, which shall be incorporated, to the extent applicable, in the Architect's Contract. In each instance both parties shall have until the respective completion dates set forth in the Progress Schedule to review each submission and to notify the other party of approval or disapproval. Tenant may disapprove any new items shown on a submission which are not in compliance with (i) the Preliminary Design Concept with regard to the Schematic Design Documents, (ii) the Schematic Design Documents with regard to the Design Development Documents, or (iii) the Design Development Documents with regard to the Final Design Documents, specifying and detailing in each case such objections. To the extent that any such submission is consistent with prior submissions approved by Tenant, such submission shall be approved by Tenant, provided however, that Tenant shall have the right, with Landlord's approval, to make modifications as set forth in the next sentence hereof. Tenant, with the approval of Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall have the right to modify the design of the Base Building Improvements at any time during the design process contemplated hereby, provided that if as a result of any such design change (a) any particular Design Document submission is not approved by the applicable completion date set forth on the Progress Schedule, or (b) any such design change delays the Substantial Completion Date, such lack of approval or design change shall constitute a Tenant Delay for purposes of Section 3.2. In the event Tenant shall fail to object to any Design Documents submissions by the applicable completion date for such submission set forth in the Progress Schedule, provided that Tenant had received such submission not less than five (5) business days prior to the applicable completion date, such failure shall constitute a Tenant Delay for purposes of Section 3.2. If Tenant objects to any such submission because such submission is inconsistent with the prior submission approved by Tenant, Landlord shall cause Landlord's Architect to modify such submission to respond to Tenant's objection and submit such modified submission to Tenant within five (5) business days after receipt of Tenant's objections for approval by Tenant in the same manner as with regard to the prior submission. Rejection of new items included in any submission that are inconsistent with the approvals given for prior design phases shall not give rise to a Tenant Delay so long as the initial rejection was delivered within the dates established</p>
          <p id="s1p351">17</p>
          <p id="s1p352">in the Progress Schedule, as modified. Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate with one another diligently and in good faith so as to complete the review and approval of all Design Document submission by the applicable completion dates set forth in the Progress Schedule.</p>
          <p id="s1p353">Upon approval of the Final Design Documents, Landlord shall solicit bids from general contractors or construction managers mutually identified by Landlord and Tenant by the date set forth in the Progress Schedule. Landlord and Tenant shall mutually determine whether such bids shall be submitted on the basis of a guaranteed maximum or fixed price contract basis. Upon receipt of bids from such general contractors or construction managers, Landlord and Tenant shall mutually select Landlord's Contractor from among such bidders and thereupon Landlord shall enter into a contract (the &quot;Construction Contract&quot;) with Landlord's Contractor for construction of the Base Building Improvements. The parties acknowledge that if Landlord and Tenant have agreed to hire the Construction Cost Estimator to serve as Construction Manager/General Contractor for the Building, instead of soliciting bids from general contractors or construction managers as described above, such Construction Manager shall instead be required to solicit bids from all subcontractors, and in such case Landlord and Tenant shall be entitled to approve the subcontractors selected by the Construction Manager and require Landlord's Contractor to enter into such subcontracts. The Construction Contract shall be subject to Tenant's prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, after such bids are received, none of such bids is acceptable to Tenant and/or Tenant seeks any change in previously approved Design Documents, and as a result thereof Tenant fails or refuses to approve the Final Project Budget (as hereinafter defined) by the date set forth in the Project Schedule, such failure or refusal shall constitute a Tenant Delay. Additionally, Tenant shall have no right to withhold approval of any general contractor bid or any subcontractor bid if the total amount of all such bids does not exceed by more than fifteen percent (15%) the estimated amount thereof set forth in the preliminary budget for Project Cost or the updated budget for Project Cost, as the case may be, then most recently approved by Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p354">As used in this Lease, the term &quot;Project Cost&quot; shall mean (i) all hard costs and soft costs incurred by Landlord in connection with the construction of the Base Building Improvements as reflected in a final project budget (the &quot;Final Project Budget&quot;) to be mutually approved by Landlord and Tenant based upon, inter alia, all amounts payable by Landlord pursuant to the Architect's Contract and the Construction Contract, and including all liabilities and expenses of all architectural and engineering services relating to Landlord's Work, appropriate amounts for the other line item categories set forth on the Project Budget form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 (the &quot;Project Budget Form&quot;), (ii) the net amount of all Change Orders (as hereinafter defined), (iii) a pro-rata portion of all &quot;Mitigation Expenses&quot; (as such term is hereafter defined) incurred by Landlord or any Affiliate of Landlord pursuant to the Development Approvals and the Subsequent Approvals (as such terms are defined in Section 3.1.4 hereof), which pro-rata portion shall be equal to the ratio of the gross floor area of the Building (as such gross floor area is determined pursuant to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance) to 1,313,000 square feet (being the maximum amount of gross floor area, determined pursuant to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, permitted to be developed in the Complex pursuant to the PUD Approval (as such term is defined in Section 3.1.4 hereof) except as hereinafter set forth and (iv) taxes and assessments for the Building and Lot, utility and insurance costs for the Building and Lot and all other operating and maintenance costs for the Building and Lot, in each case incurred by Landlord for the period from the Substantial Completion Date through the Term Commencement Date. The term &quot;Mitigation Expenses&quot; shall mean all capital expenses for housing linkage payments and public open space linkage payments required pursuant to the PUD Approval with respect to the Building, costs of traffic mitigation required by the Development Approvals and Subsequent Approvals and infrastructure improvements for the Complex required by the Development Approvals and Subsequent Approvals. Tenant's pro-rata share of capital expenses for housing linkage payments and public open space linkage payments required pursuant to the PUD Approval with respect to the Building shall be equal to the ratio of the Rentable Square Footage of Premises to the Rentable Square Footage of Building. For</p>

          <p id="s1p356">purposes of determining Project Cost, the line item amount for Land and Environmental Remediation shall be fixed at $60.00 per r.s.f. regardless of the actual cost of such line item; Project Cost shall not include any amount for construction of the Garage (as hereinafter defined) or for the leasing of (or the making of any tenant improvements to) the Expansion Spaces to tenants; the developer's fee shall be fixed at five percent (5%) of Project Cost (exclusive, however, of the line item amounts for Land and Environmental Remediation, Development Fee/Supervision (the &quot;Developer's Fee&quot;) and Interest on Landlord's Equity (as such term is hereinafter defined)); the broker's fee shall not exceed $7.50 per r.s.f. and no amount shall be included in Project Cost for general or administrative expenses of Landlord or for improvements to the Retail Space in excess of the cost of Base Building Improvements related thereto, and no amount shall be included in Project Cost for any interest, charges or fees paid or payable by Landlord with respect to any construction loan financing for the Project. Project Cost shall include an amount determined by multiplying all components of the Project Cost (exclusive, however, of the line item for the Developer's Fee) by twelve percent (12%) per annum for the period commencing as of the date the cost of each such component is incurred through and including the Term Commencement Date (as so determined, &quot;Interest on Landlord's Equity&quot;), it being understood and agreed by Landlord and Tenant that Interest on Landlord's Equity with respect to any component of Project Cost that Landlord has acquired, purchased or incurred prior to the date of execution of this Lease, such as the cost of the Land &amp; Environmental component of the Project Cost, shall be deemed to begin to accrue, not as of the date that the cost was actually incurred, but rather as of the execution date of this Lease. Landlord shall account for all Project Costs on a so-called &quot;open book&quot; basis. Within ninety (90) days after the Substantial Completion Date, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a full accounting of the Project Cost incurred as of the Substantial Completion Date; Tenant, from the date hereof through the date which is twelve (12) months after receipt of such full accounting of Project Cost, may review all of Landlord's books and records relating to the incurrence and payment of the Project Cost in order to verify and confirm the accuracy thereof. If Landlord incurs any cost or expense properly includable in Project Cost after the Substantial Completion Date (including, without limitation, any Mitigation Expenses) which is not included in the full accounting, Landlord shall notify Tenant thereof and Landlord shall provide Tenant with such documentation with respect thereto as Tenant reasonably may request. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that the incurrence of additional costs and expenses by Landlord after the Substantial Completion Date which are properly includable in Project Cost will result in an increase in the Annual Fixed Rent Rate, which increase shall be effective as of the date of incurrence thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p357">Tenant shall have the right (but not the obligation) to offer to finance up to twenty percent (20%) of the Project Cost as hereinafter provided (&quot;Tenant Financing&quot;). If Tenant shall desire to offer Tenant Financing, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice (&quot;Financing Notice&quot;) of such offer not later than thirty (30) days after Landlord and Tenant have agreed upon the first preliminary Project Budget; such Financing Notice shall specify the amount (the &quot;Tenant Financing Amount&quot;) and other financial terms of such Tenant Financing described below. Delivery by Tenant of a Financing Notice shall constitute a representation by Tenant that it has the capacity to provide such Tenant Financing.</p>
          <p id="s1p358">If Tenant offers to provide Tenant Financing and all of the terms and conditions thereof, including without limitation, all documents evidencing and securing Tenant Financing, are acceptable to Landlord and its construction and/or permanent lenders, in their respective sole discretion, Tenant shall make a loan to Landlord for an amount equal to the Tenant Financing Amount. The Financing Notice shall specify the interest rate per annum payable on such Tenant Financing loan and the repayment schedule (interest only until maturity; or payments of principal and interest based upon the amortization period specified by Tenant in the Financing Notice), which interest rate and repayment schedule shall be subject to Landlord acceptance or rejection. Such Tenant Financing loan shall be due and payable not later than the scheduled expiration date of the initial Term of the Lease, and shall be secured by a mortgage on the Lot and Building, which mortgage shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any mortgage granted to any lender now or hereafter providing Landlord with construction and/or</p>

The amount by which the Project Cost exceeds the Tenant Financing Amount is herein referred to as the &quot;Landlord Project Cost Portion&quot;. Tenant agrees that upon any uncured Event of Default hereunder, Landlord shall be entitled to offset against any payments due under the Tenant Financing loan any amount owed by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to this Lease. In addition, Tenant agrees that it will enter into any intercreditor agreement (which may include typical subordinate lender standstill agreements) requested by any lender providing Landlord's Project Financing. Tenant shall disburse the proceeds of such Tenant Financing loan to Landlord on the Commencement Date, and Landlord shall apply such proceeds to pay down Landlord's Project Financing by the Tenant Financing Amount.</p>
          <p id="s1p361">If Tenant provides Tenant Financing as aforesaid, the definition of Annual Fixed Rent Rate set forth in Section 1.1 shall be deemed to be revised to read as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p362">Subject to Sections 4.1(b), 10.11 and 10.12 thereof, an amount equal to (a) the sum of (i) the product of (x) the Landlord Project Cost Portion multiplied by (y) twelve percent (12%) plus (ii) the product of (x) the Tenant Financing Amount multiplied by (y) the Tenant Financing interest rate per annum payable on the Tenant Financing (or debt service constant if Tenant elects to have the Tenant Financing amortized), divided by (b) the Rentable Square Footage of the Building.</p>

As used herein, the term &quot;Change Order&quot; shall mean (A) a written order from Landlord which Landlord determines is necessary to carry out the approved design and construction of the Base Building Improvements, whether due to any mistake or omission in, or clarification of, the Design Documents, or (B) a written order to Landlord from Tenant requesting or authorizing a Change in Landlord's Work or an adjustment of the Project Cost or the Progress Schedule. Landlord shall provide Tenant with copies of all proposed and final Change Orders. In addition: subject to the last sentence of this Subparagraph (a), (i) with respect to additive Change Orders, the Project Cost shall be increased by an amount equal to the change in the cost of Landlord's Work (as determined pursuant to the Construction Contract and/or the Architect's Contract) attributable to such Change Order, and (ii) with respect to deductive Change Orders, the Project Cost shall be reduced by the change in the cost of Landlord's Work (as determined pursuant to the Construction Contract and/or the Architect's Contract) attributable to such Change Order. Additive or deductive Change Orders shall result in an increase or decrease, respectively, in the Developer's Fee (but not in any change of the percentage thereof), and Landlord shall be reimbursed by Tenant, either directly or through an increase or decrease, as applicable, in the Project Cost, for the actual cost of overhead and profit, if any, which Landlord is required to pay to Landlord's Contractor on account of any additive Change Order as set forth in the Construction Contract approved by Tenant and Landlord.

          <p id="s1p385">3.2 PREPARATION OF PREMISES FOR PERFORMANCE OF TENANT'S WORK.</p>
          <p id="s1p386">During the course of performance of Landlord's Work, Landlord and Tenant shall meet on not less than a monthly basis to review the progress of Landlord's Work. Landlord agrees to use reasonable and diligent efforts to have the Premises ready for the performance of Tenant's Work on or before the Scheduled Substantial Completion Date which Substantial Completion Date shall, however, be extended for a period equal to that of (a) any delays due to Acts of God, labor disputes or unrest, riots, fire, unusual delays in deliveries, casualties or other causes beyond Landlord's reasonable control (collectively, &quot;Force Majeure Events&quot;) and (b) any delays due to (i) any Change Order, (ii) any act, omission or neglect of Tenant, or of any employee, agent, or separate contractor of Tenant, (iii) the concurrent performance of the Base Building Improvements and Tenant's Work, (iv) Tenant's failure to furnish information or approve any of the Design Documents, the Architect's Contract, the Construction Contract or the Project Cost by the applicable dates set forth in the Progress Schedule or to respond to any request by Landlord for information or approval within the time period required by the Progress Schedule, or if no time period is required by the Progress Schedule, within five (5) business days of Landlord's request, or (v) any breach or default by Tenant in the performance of Tenant's obligations pursuant to this Lease, even if such breach or default is cured (collectively, &quot;Tenant Delay&quot;). In the event of any such Force Majeure Event, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to eliminate the cause of such delays or to secure alternate supplies. If any one or more Force Majeure Events shall delay the Substantial Completion Date by more than one hundred eighty (180) days, either Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease upon not less than fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the other. A Tenant Delay shall not affect the Substantial Completion Date unless Landlord has given Tenant notice thereof and Tenant fails to cure the same within two (2) business days, provided, however, that Landlord shall not be required to provide Tenant with any notice or opportunity to cure with respect to any date set forth in the Progress Schedule by which Tenant must take any action, and any failure or refusal by Tenant to take such action by any such date set forth in the Progress Schedule, which failure or refusal in fact results in a delay, shall constitute a Tenant Delay. As used herein, the term &quot;Substantial Completion Date&quot; shall mean and refer to the date on which: (i) the Base Building Improvements have been substantially completed in accordance with the Final Design Documents, as affected by Change Orders, without material deviation therefrom as certified by Landlord's Architect and confirmed by Tenant's Architect, which confirmation shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, with the exception of minor items which can be fully completed by Landlord within thirty (30) days without material interference with Tenant and other items which because of the season or weather or the nature of the item are not practicable to do at the time, provided that none of said items is necessary to perform Tenant's Work (collectively &quot;Punch List Items&quot;), (ii) if Tenant's Work has not then commenced, a Certificate of Occupancy from the City of Cambridge (or a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy with conditions which can be satisfied without material interference with the performance of Tenant's Work) shall have been obtained, (iii) the Premises are broom clean and free of debris except to the extent, if any, resulting from Tenant's Work, and (iv) all utilities required for the use of the Premises have been brought by Landlord to the location(s) shown on the Final Design Documents, as the same may be affected by Change Orders; provided, however, that if the Substantial Completion Date does not occur on or before the Scheduled Substantial Completion Date due to any Tenant Delay, then solely for purposes of determining the Commencement Date under Section 2.2 and</p>
          <p id="s1p387">23</p>
          <p id="s1p388">other applicable provisions of this Lease, the Base Building Improvements shall be deemed to be substantially completed, and the Substantial Completion Date shall be deemed to have occurred, on the date on which the Substantial Completion Date would have occurred taking into account any Force Majeure Events but without taking into account any Tenant Delay. If Landlord's Architect has certified that the Base Building Improvements are substantially complete but Tenant's Architect does not confirm the same within five (5) business days thereafter, Landlord's Architect and Tenant's Architect shall immediately select a third independent architect who shall conclusively determine whether the Base Building Improvements are substantially complete. Landlord and Tenant shall share equally the costs of such third architect. Landlord's Work shall be deemed to have been performed as of the date on which the Base Building Improvements are substantially complete (as certified by Landlord's Architect and confirmed by Tenant's Architect or such independent architect) except for latent defects, Punch List Items and items which do not conform with the requirements of the Final Design Documents, as affected by Change Orders, and as to which Tenant or Tenant's Architect shall have given written notice to Landlord prior to such date. If Tenant or Tenant's Architect does not provide such written notice prior to the date on which the Base Building Improvements are substantially complete, a certificate of substantial completion by a licensed architect or registered engineer shall be conclusive evidence that Landlord has performed all such obligations except for latent defects, Punch List Items and items stated in such certificate to be incomplete or not in conformity with such requirements. Landlord shall use reasonable and diligent efforts to complete Punch List Items within thirty (30) days after the Substantial Completion Date and in a manner which will not unreasonably interfere with the performance of Tenant's Work (as defined in Section 3.2.1 hereof). Landlord represents that Landlord has the capacity to effect financial arrangements to enable Landlord to complete Landlord's Work, and to otherwise enable Landlord to fulfill all of its obligations under this Lease. After the commencement of construction of Landlord's Work, Landlord shall furnish to Tenant, at Tenant's request, a copy of the portions of Landlord's financing commitment for construction of the Building confirming the availability of construction financing therefor. Tenant agrees to observe any reasonable limitations on dissemination thereof to others that Landlord may impose.</p>
          <p id="s1p389">Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if Landlord has not commenced the Environmental Remediation of the Lot by the date set forth in the Progress Schedule, (B) if Landlord has not filed a Response Action Outcome Statement (as such term is defined in the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, 310 CMR 40.0000 et seq., as amended (&quot;MCP&quot;)) for the Lot by the date set forth in the Progress Schedule, (C) if a building permit for the Base Building Improvements has not been issued by the date set forth in the Progress Schedule, (D) if construction of the Base Building Improvements has not commenced by the date set forth in the Progress Schedule (each of the foregoing being referred to as a &quot;Landlord Milestone Date&quot;), Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease as hereinafter set forth. Upon request of Tenant, Landlord shall provide such evidence as Tenant reasonably may request to evidence achievement of each Landlord Milestone Date. Each of the Landlord Milestone Dates shall be extended by one business day for each day of Tenant Delay occurring before a respective Landlord Milestone Date. If Landlord is in default with respect to any Landlord Milestone Date, as extended as aforesaid by any Tenant Delay, Tenant shall notify Landlord within five (5) business days thereof. If Landlord does not cure the default or alleged default within thirty (30) business days after receipt of such notice, Tenant, upon written notice, may thereupon terminate this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p390">If the Garage and the streets and roadways of the Complex necessary for access to the Building and Garage are not substantially complete by the date of substantial completion of Tenant's Work to be performed in connection with Tenant's initial occupancy of the Premises then Tenant, as Tenant's sole remedy, shall receive a credit against the initial and succeeding payments of the Parking Fee due hereunder, until such credit is fully exhausted, equal to two day's Parking Fee (for all of Tenant's Garage Parking Spaces or for such number of Tenant's Garage Parking Spaces as may be unavailable, as applicable) for each day from substantial completion of Tenant's Work until the Garage and such street and roadway work are substantially complete.</p>
          <p id="s1p391">24</p>
          <p id="s1p392">In the event Landlord's Work shall not be substantially completed by the Scheduled Substantial Completion Date specified in Section 1.1 (as and to the extent such Scheduled Substantial Completion Date may be extended by Tenant Delays and delays caused by Force Majeure Events), then after the Term does commence, Tenant, as Tenant's sole remedy, shall receive a credit against the initial and succeeding payments of Annual Fixed Rent due hereunder, until such credit is fully exhausted, equal to one day's Annual Fixed Rent for each day from the Scheduled Substantial Completion Date (as so extended) until the date that Landlord's Work is substantially completed.</p>
          <p id="s1p393">In the event Landlord's Work shall not be substantially completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Scheduled Substantial Completion Date (as and to the extent such Scheduled Substantial Completion Date may be extended by Tenant Delays and delays caused by Force Majeure Events) (such 180th day is referred to herein as the &quot;Outside Completion Date&quot;), Tenant may at any time thereafter, but prior to Landlord's Work being substantially completed, notify Landlord of Tenant's election to terminate this Lease. Tenant shall give Landlord no less than thirty (30) days' prior notice of Tenant's intention to terminate this Lease before notifying Landlord of Tenant's election to terminate this Lease; it being understood and agreed, however, that Tenant may give notice of such intention as early as thirty (30) days prior to the Outside Completion Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p394">3.2.1. Performance of Tenant's Work.</p>
          <p id="s1p395">Except for the Base Building Improvements to be performed by Landlord in accordance with the Design Documents, all of Tenant's initial interior improvements, fixtures, finishes, furnishings, furniture, telephones, movable equipment and signs (collectively, &quot;Tenant's Work&quot;), shall be performed and provided at the sole cost and expense of Tenant. Tenant's performance of Tenant's Work shall be coordinated with any work being performed by Landlord and/or by any Affiliate of Landlord in the Building, on the Lot or in the Complex in such manner as to maintain harmonious labor relations during the performance of Landlord's Work (which Landlord expects will be performed by union contractors) and thereafter and not to damage the Building or Lot or interfere with Building or Lot operations or with any work being performed by or on behalf of Landlord or any Affiliate of Landlord in the Complex. All work described in Tenant's Work shall be performed by an Approved Contractor. For purposes of this Lease, an &quot;Approved Contractor&quot; shall mean a contractor or mechanic identified by Tenant in writing, who has been approved by Landlord in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Contractors may be approved in one of two ways. First, Tenant may submit to Landlord in writing from time to time a list (or a revised list) of contractors that Tenant anticipates using from time to time to perform Tenant's Work. If Landlord fails to object to any of the contractors identified on such list within ten (10) days after receipt of such list from Tenant, all contractors identified on such list shall be deemed &quot;Approved Contractors&quot;. Second, Tenant may submit to Landlord from time to time requests for Landlord to approve specific contractors (not already on the list of Approved Contractors) to perform Tenant's Work. Landlord shall have the right, upon written notice to Tenant to withdraw its approval of any previously Approved Contractors at any time for any cause as determined in Landlord's reasonable judgment. A contractor's failure to provide or maintain adequate insurance levels shall be a reasonable basis for Landlord to withhold or withdraw approval unless Tenant notifies Landlord in writing that such contractor shall be covered by insurance then being maintained by Tenant and if Tenant provides documentary evidence that said Contractor is covered and of the amount of coverage. Additionally, Landlord may withhold or withdraw approval of any contractor proposed by Tenant or previously approved by Landlord to perform any Tenant's Work if Landlord determines, in Landlord's sole but reasonable discretion, that any contractor proposed or previously approved by Landlord by Tenant for the performance of any Tenant's Work does not have a sufficient bonding capacity or may cause picketing, labor unrest, strikes, protests or similar activities (collectively &quot;Labor Unrest&quot;). If after approval of an Approved Contractor by Landlord, any Labor Unrest shall occur or be threatened on account of any Tenant's Work, Landlord shall have the right to require cessation of Tenant's Work until resolution of such Labor Unrest. Except</p>
          <p id="s1p396">25</p>
          <p id="s1p397">as set forth in Sections 3.2.1 and 5.1.10 hereof, all initial Tenant's Work which may constitute a fixture, part of the real estate, a part of a Building system or Building utilities shall become a part of the Premises and upon termination of this Lease shall be considered to be the property of the Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p398">Unless Tenant agrees to readapt the Premises for a typical general office layout prior to the expiration or termination of the Lease, Tenant shall not effect any Tenant's Work (or any alterations or additions to the Premises after performance of the initial Tenant's Work) that might require any unusual expense to reuse the Premises for any general office use.</p>
          <p id="s1p399">Tenant's Work shall be performed in accordance with complete, consistent, final construction drawings and specifications (&quot;Construction Documents&quot;) approved by Landlord in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Construction Documents shall be prepared and stamped by Tenant's Architect. Landlord reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any or all of the Construction Documents which in its reasonable opinion fail to comply with Sections 3.2.1, 3.3 and 5.1.5 of this Lease within fifteen (15) business days of its receipt thereof (the &quot;Review Period&quot;). The Review Period shall not commence unless and until Tenant delivers a complete set of Construction Documents. If Landlord shall disapprove the Construction Documents, it shall state specifically the reasons therefor, and Tenant shall promptly revise and resubmit the Construction Documents. If Landlord fails to respond to Tenant's request for approval of the Construction Documents within the Review Period, then the Construction Documents shall be deemed approved. Upon completion of Tenant's Work to prepare the Premises for Tenant's initial occupancy, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a set of as-built plans, and operating and maintenance manuals therefor.</p>
          <p id="s1p400">Tenant shall be solely responsible for the liabilities of and expenses of all architectural and engineering services relating to Tenant's Work and for the adequacy, accuracy, and completeness of the Construction Documents approved by Landlord. The Construction Documents (i) shall set forth in detail the requirements for construction of the Tenant's Work (including all architectural, mechanical, electrical and structural drawings and detailed specifications), (ii) shall be fully coordinated with one another and with field conditions as they exist in the Premises and elsewhere in the Building, and (iii) shall show all work necessary to complete the Tenant's Work including all cutting, fitting, and patching and all connections to the mechanical and electrical systems and components of the Building. Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless if any Tenant's Work described in the Construction Documents (a) fails to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, building codes, building design standards, the Development Approvals and Subsequent Approvals, (b) in any manner affects any structural component of the Building (including, without limitation, exterior walls, exterior windows, core walls, roofs or floor slabs), (c) in any respect is incompatible with the electrical and mechanical components and systems of the Building, (d) affects the exterior of the Building, (e) fails to conform to floor loading limits, and (f) with respect to all materials, equipment and special designs, processes or products, infringes any patent or other proprietary rights of others. Landlord's approval or deemed approval of the Construction Documents and the performance of Tenant's Work pursuant to the Construction Documents shall not result in any liability of Landlord, and Landlord's approval of Construction Documents shall signify only Landlord's consent to Tenant's Work shown thereon and shall not result in any responsibility of Landlord concerning compliance of Tenant's Work with laws, regulations, or codes, coordination of any aspect of Tenant's Work with any other aspect of Tenant's Work, or the feasibility of constructing Tenant's Work without material damage or harm to the Building, all of which shall be the sole responsibility of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p401">If Tenant enters into a contract with Landlord's Contractor for the performance of Tenant's Work to prepare the Premises for Tenant's initial occupancy, Landlord agrees that Tenant shall have a license to enter the Premises at such time or times prior to the Term Commencement Date as Landlord, in its sole but reasonable discretion, may permit to enable Tenant to carry out Tenant's Work. Upon any such entry by Tenant prior to the Term Commencement Date, Tenant shall be subject to, and perform all of</p>
          <p id="s1p402">26</p>
          <p id="s1p403">its obligations under this Lease except for the obligation to pay Rent, which obligation shall not arise until the Term Commencement Date occurs.</p>
          <p id="s1p404">An Approved Contractor may be used by Tenant until Landlord notifies Tenant that an Approved Contractor is no longer approved due to such Approved Contractor's failure to comply in any material respect with the requirements of the Construction Documents and/or this Lease. Tenant shall procure all necessary governmental permits, licenses and approvals before undertaking any Tenant's Work. When any Tenant's Work is in progress, Tenant shall cause to be maintained insurance as may be required by Landlord covering any additional hazards due to such Tenant Work, for the benefit of Landlord. It shall be a condition of Landlord's approval of any Tenant's Work that certificates of such insurance issued by a responsible insurance company qualified to do business in Massachusetts and having a Best's Insurance Rating of A- or better, shall have been deposited with Landlord, that Tenant has provided Tenant's certification of the insurable value of the work in question for casualty insurance purposes, and that all of the other conditions of the Lease have been satisfied. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for up to $25,000 of the reasonable, out-of-pocket, third party costs of reviewing proposed Construction Documents and Tenant's Work and inspecting installation of the same. At all times while performing Tenant's Work, Tenant shall require each Approved Contractor performing Tenant's Work to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, permits and policies relating to such work. In performing Tenant's Work, each Approved Contractor shall comply with Landlord's requirements set forth in Section 3.2.1, Section 3.3, Section 5.1.5 and Section 5.2.3 hereof relating to the time and methods for such work, use of delivery elevators and other Building facilities and each Approved Contractor shall not interfere with or disrupt Landlord's Contractor. Each Approved Contractor shall in all events work on the Premises without causing labor disharmony, coordination difficulties, or delay or impairment of any guaranties, warranties or obligations of any contractors of Landlord and without causing unreasonable interference with the rights of other tenants in the Building. If any Approved Contractor uses any Building services or facilities prior to the Commencement Date, such Contractor, jointly and severally with Tenant, shall agree to reimburse Landlord for the cost thereof based on Landlord's schedule of charges established from time to time (and if no such charges have been established, then based on Landlord's reasonable charge established at the time). Tenant shall include a provision in each contract with each Approved Contractor whereby such Approved Contractor shall, by entry into the Building or onto the Lot or Complex, agree to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from any claim, loss or expense arising in whole or in part out of any act or neglect committed by such person while in the Building or on the Lot or Complex, to the same extent as Tenant has so agreed in this Lease, which indemnities of Tenant and Approved Contractor shall be joint and several.</p>
          <p id="s1p405">Subject to Tenant's right to contest amounts due to any Approved Contractor, Tenant shall pay on or prior to date when any such payment is due the entire cost of all Tenant's Work so that the Premises shall always be free of liens for labor or materials. If any mechanic's lien (which term shall include all similar liens relating to the furnishing of labor and materials) is filed against the Premises, the Building, the Lot or the Complex or any part thereof (regardless of whether Tenant contests the same) which is claimed to be attributable to Tenant, its agents, employees or contractors, Tenant shall promptly discharge the same by payment or filing any necessary bond within thirty (30) days after Tenant has notice (from any source) of such mechanic's lien. Tenant shall prepare and complete not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Rentable Square Footage of Premises for Tenant's occupancy within nine (9) months after the Substantial Completion Date. If Tenant does not prepare and complete the entire Premises for Tenant's occupancy within nine (9) months after the Substantial Completion Date, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord on or before the end of such nine-month period a completion bond, letter of credit or similar security in the amount of Landlord's reasonable estimate of the cost to so complete the Premises. The form and substance of such bond, letter of credit or similar security shall be subject to Landlord's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.</p>

          <p id="s1p407">After the performance of Tenant's Work to prepare the Premises for Tenant's initial occupancy, (i) all Tenant's Work shall be subject to all provisions of this Lease relating to Tenant's Work to prepare the Premises for Tenant's initial occupancy, except as expressly set forth herein, and (ii) Landlord and Tenant shall agree in writing, at the time Landlord approves any alteration or addition, whether Tenant will be required to, permitted to or forbidden to, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, remove any such alteration or addition and/or to readapt, repair or restore the Premises to substantially the condition the same were in prior to such alteration or addition upon the expiration or termination of this Lease. Landlord's approval of any alteration or addition which is not a Minor Alteration (as hereinafter defined in this Section 3.2) shall be deemed to have been given if Landlord fails to notify Tenant of its objection thereto within fifteen (15) business days after Tenant's request for such approval. In circumstances in which Tenant desires the right to remove additions or alterations at the expiration or termination of this Lease, Landlord shall reasonably agree, and such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and shall be deemed to have been given if Landlord fails to notify Tenant of its objection thereto within fifteen (15) business days after Tenant's request for such agreement), to permit such removal where items installed by Tenant are in the nature of equipment, but are so affixed to Building that such items may be construed as fixtures. Tenant's rights to remove additions or alterations hereunder shall not apply to replacement of items included in Tenant's Work that are replaced due to the fact that such items have worn out or become substantially obsolete. After the performance of Tenant's Work, all changes and additions shall be part of the Building except such items as by writing at the time of approval the parties agree either shall be removed or left by Tenant on termination of this Lease, or shall be removed or left at Tenant's election.</p>
          <p id="s1p408">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereby agree that for any non-structural alterations or additions to the Premises which do not involve modifications to the Building operating systems and for which the cost may be reasonably estimated to be less than $100,000 (each a &quot;Minor Alteration&quot;): (i) Landlord's prior written consent shall not be required unless such Minor Alteration requires a building permit from the City of Cambridge, in which case Landlord's reasonable consent shall be required, provided that such consent shall be deemed to have been given if Landlord fails to notify Tenant of its objection to such Minor Alteration within five (5) days after Tenant's request for Landlord's consent with respect thereto, and (ii) if Landlord's consent was not obtained therefor, upon the expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant shall readapt, repair and restore the affected portion of the Premises to substantially the condition the same were in prior to such Minor Alteration. Additionally, Tenant shall give prior written notice to Landlord of any Minor Alteration for which the cost may be reasonably estimated to be less than $100,000 but greater than $25,000 and regardless of whether Landlord's consent is required.</p>
          <p id="s1p409">The parties further agree that after the performance of Tenant's Work to prepare the Premises for Tenant's initial occupancy (a) any request for Landlord's consent to any alteration or addition (including, without limitation, any Minor Alteration) shall be accompanied by drawings and specifications in reasonable detail given the size and scope of the proposed alteration or addition, and (b) Tenant shall furnish Landlord as-built drawings showing any and all alterations or additions (including, without limitation, any and all Minor Alterations) made by Tenant or any assignee, sublessee or licensee of Tenant within 30 days after completion of the same.</p>

Either party may inspect the work of the other at reasonable times and shall give notice of observed defects. Landlord shall not be responsible for any loss, damage, or injury resulting from the installation of any components, fixtures, or equipment provided they were appropriately specified and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's or supplier's instructions; provided, however, that Landlord shall assign any and all contractor's, manufacturer's and supplier's warranties with respect to the Base Building Improvements, including, without limitation, Landlord's Contractor's warranty as set forth in the Construction Contract, to Tenant for the Term of this Lease, upon the expiration or sooner termination of which such warranties shall automatically revert to Landlord.</p>

If within one year after the Substantial Completion Date (i) any item of Base Building Improvements does not conform with the Final Design Documents or (ii) there is any latent defect or any other defect in the Base Building Improvements caused by faulty workmanship performed on behalf of Landlord or materials installed on behalf of Landlord, Landlord, upon written notice thereof from Tenant prior to the expiration of such one-year period, shall forthwith cause such nonconformity or defect to be corrected without cost or expense to Tenant.</p>

Commencing on the Commencement Date, Tenant covenants and agrees to pay Fixed Rent (as hereinafter defined) for the Premises to Landlord by wire transfer as Landlord may from time to time direct in writing, without any offset or reduction whatsoever (except as may be made in accordance with the express provisions of this Lease), or in the absence of wire transfer instructions from Landlord, at the Original Address of Landlord or at such other place or to such other person or entity as Landlord may by notice to Tenant from time to time direct, in the amount of (x) the Annual Fixed Rent Rate set forth in Article I multiplied by (y) the Rentable Square Footage of the Premises, and subject to adjustment as set forth in Sections 4.1(b),</p>

Tenant, however, shall have no right to approve the amount of any costs which may be incurred by Landlord with respect to such categories, except to the extent set forth in Section 10.11(h) hereof. At the beginning of every fiscal year, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant its reasonable estimate of the Annual Maintenance Charge (the &quot;Estimated Annual Maintenance Charge&quot;) for the said fiscal year, which estimate may include a reasonable contingency of up to five percent (5%), and Tenant shall make payments on account of the Annual Maintenance Charge monthly in advance on the first day of each calendar month during the Term in the amount of one-twelfth of the Estimated Annual Maintenance Charge. Landlord reserves the right to reasonably re-estimate and modify the Estimated Annual Maintenance Charge by notice to Tenant once annually in each Lease Year (the &quot;Additional Rent Adjustment Date&quot;), and Tenant's payments shall thereupon be adjusted accordingly. Not later than ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year during the Term and after Lease termination, Landlord shall render a statement (&quot;Landlord's Statement&quot;), in reasonable detail and according to usual accounting practices, certified by Landlord and showing for the preceding fiscal year or fraction thereof, as the case may be, the actual Annual Maintenance Charge for the said fiscal year or fraction thereof, and thereupon any balance owed by Tenant shall be paid to Landlord within twenty (20) days after Tenant receives written notice thereof, and any excess paid by Tenant under this Section shall be paid to Landlord, or credited to Tenant, on the next rent payment date. Tenant shall have the right for a period of one (1) year following its receipt of Landlord's Statement to examine Landlord's books and records concerning the Annual Maintenance Charge. Such examination may be made only by an independent certified public accounting firm approved by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Landlord may withhold its approval of any examiner of Tenant who or which is being paid by Tenant, in whole or in part, on a contingent fee basis. As a condition to performing any such examination, Tenant and its examiner shall be required to execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement, in form acceptable to Landlord, agreeing to keep confidential any information which it discovers about Landlord, the Building or the Complex in connection with such examination. If the Annual Maintenance Charge due was less than the Annual Maintenance Charge paid by Tenant, Landlord shall either promptly refund to Tenant the difference or credit same against rent next due from Tenant.

Tenant shall not assign this Lease or sublease any portion of the Premises to any other tenant in the Complex (unless such assignee or subtenant is an Affiliate of Tenant) if Landlord has or expects to have (within two years of the date of the proposed assignment or sublease) vacant space in the Complex for the Permitted Uses or if the proposed assignee or subtenant (other than an Affiliate of Tenant) has been shown space in the Complex within six months prior to the date of the proposed assignment or sublease. In addition, as to any assignee or subtenant of all or substantially all of the Premises, Landlord's consent shall be required as to the creditworthiness of the proposed assignee or subtenant in view of market conditions then prevailing for leases having terms and conditions comparable to this Lease and the obligations of such assignee or subtenant pursuant to this Lease.</p>

If Landlord does not exercise such right to terminate this Lease as to, and recapture, the portion of the Premises affected by such assignment or sublease, Tenant shall have the right to consummate the assignment or sublease at such rent as Tenant may determine, provided however, that Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent (50%) of Sublease Profits (as herein defined) on account thereof.</p>

The term &quot;Sublease Costs&quot; shall mean and refer to Tenant's reasonable legal, brokerage and construction costs and expenses incurred in good faith in view of the size and expected term of any applicable sublease or assignment and the then unamortized costs of Tenant's Work incurred by Tenant to prepare the Premises for Tenant's initial occupancy of the Premises. Sublease Costs shall be amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable sublease or assignment, except that the costs of Tenant's Work incurred by Tenant to prepare the Premises for Tenant's initial occupancy of the Premises shall be amortized on a straight line basis over the initial Term of this Lease.</p>

          <p id="s1p555">(a)(i) If the Premises, or any part thereof, shall be damaged by fire or other casualty, Tenant shall give prompt notice thereof to Landlord, and Landlord, upon receiving such notice, shall proceed promptly and with due diligence, subject to Force Majeure Events, to repair, or cause to be repaired, such damage except as otherwise provided herein. With respect to portions of the Building or Lot outside of the Premises that shall be damaged by fire or other casualty, Landlord shall proceed promptly and with due diligence, subject to Force Majeure Events, to repair, or to cause to be repaired, such damage after such damage occurs except as otherwise provided herein; and (ii) if the Garage, or any part thereof, shall be damaged by fire or other casualty and if the Garage is then owned by Landlord or an Affiliate of Landlord (as defined in Section 10.14 hereof) Landlord shall cause the Garage Owner to proceed promptly and with due diligence, subject to Force Majeure Events, to repair or cause to be repaired, such damage except as otherwise provided herein. If Landlord or an Affiliate of Landlord is not the Garage Owner at the time of such damage by fire or other casualty, Landlord shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Garage Owner to proceed promptly to repair such damage.</p>
          <p id="s1p556">(b)(i) If the Premises, or any part thereof, shall be rendered untenantable by reason of such damage, whether to the Premises or to the Building or if such damage materially interferes with Tenant's access to the Premises, Annual Fixed Rent and Additional Rent shall proportionately (i.e., based on rentable square footage) abate for that portion of the Premises which is untenantable for the period from the date of such damage or from the date when material interference with Tenant's access due to such damage commences to the date when such damage shall have been</p>

          <p id="s1p559">(c)(i) If, as a result of fire or other casualty, the whole or a substantial part of the Building is rendered untenantable, Landlord, within ninety (90) days from the date of such fire or casualty, may terminate this Lease by notice to Tenant, specifying a date not less than twenty (20) nor more than forty (40) days after the giving of such notice on which the Term of this Lease shall terminate. If Landlord does not so elect to terminate this Lease, then Landlord shall proceed with diligence to repair the damage to the Building and Premises and all facilities serving the same, and the Annual Fixed Rent and Additional Rent shall meanwhile proportionately abate, all as provided in Paragraph (b)(i) of this Section 6.1. Landlord within one hundred twenty (120) days after the fire or other casualty shall notify Tenant in writing whether or not, in its reasonable judgment, the Building and the Premises can be restored to substantially their condition prior to such damage and Utility Services restored within twelve (12) months of the date of the casualty. If such notification shall state that such restoration cannot be so accomplished, then Tenant may terminate this Lease within thirty (30) days from Tenant's receipt of such notification. Furthermore, if Tenant does not so terminate this Lease and if such damage is not repaired, Utility Services are not restored and the Premises and the remainder of the Building are not restored to substantially the same condition as they were prior to such damage within twelve (12) months from the date of such damage, Tenant within thirty (30) days from the expiration of such twelve (12) month period or from the expiration of any extension thereof by reason of Force Majeure Events (the &quot;Casualty Restoration Completion Date&quot;), may terminate this Lease by notice to Landlord, specifying a date not more than forty-five (45) days after the giving of such notice on which the term of this Lease shall terminate. The period within which the required repairs may be accomplished shall be extended by the number of days lost as a result of Force Majeure Events, provided however that such period shall in no event be extended beyond six (6) months from the Casualty Restoration Completion Date. Substantial part for purposes of this Section 6.1(c)(i) and section 6.1(d) shall mean thirty-three and one-third percent (331/3%) or more of the Building; and (ii) if as a result of fire or other casualty, the whole or a substantial part of the Garage is rendered untenantable, Landlord, within ninety (90) days from the date of such fire or casualty, shall notify Tenant whether the Garage Owner will repair the damage to the Garage. If the Garage Owner is unwilling to repair such damage and Landlord does not provide substitute parking in the Complex or within reasonable walking distance of the Premises, then Tenant may terminate this Lease by notice to Landlord, specifying a date not less than twenty (20) nor more than forty (40) days after the giving of such notice on which the Term of this Lease shall terminate. &quot;Substantial part&quot; for this Section 6.1(c)(ii) shall mean thirty-three and one-third percent (331/3%) or more of Tenant's Parking Spaces.</p>

          <p id="s1p565">(f) The provisions of this Section 6.1 shall be considered an express agreement governing any instance of damage or destruction of the Building, the Premises or the Garage by fire or other casualty, and any law now or hereafter in force providing for such contingency in the absence of express agreement shall have no application.</p>
          <p id="s1p566">(g) In the event of any termination of this Lease pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Term of this Lease shall expire as of the effective termination date as fully and completely as if such date were the date herein originally scheduled as the Term Expiration Date; provided that Landlord shall within thirty (30) days thereafter refund any prepaid Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p567">(h) If less than fifty percent (50%) of the Building shall be rendered untenantable by fire or other casualty and Landlord reasonably determines that the net proceeds of insurance recovered for such damage are not adequate to restore the Building (or Premises or Utility Service) to substantially their condition immediate prior to the damage or Landlord's mortgagee refuses to release to Landlord sufficient insurance proceeds to restore the Building (or Premises or Utility Service) to such condition, Landlord shall so notify Tenant within ninety (90) days following such fire or other casualty (the &quot;Insurance Shortfall Notice&quot;). Within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of an Insurance Shortfall Notice, Tenant may elect to (i) terminate this Lease or (ii) (x) to require Landlord to restore the Building (or Premises or Utility Service) to substantially their condition immediately prior to the occurrence of such fire or other casualty and (y) to pay the difference between the net proceeds of insurance recovered and the total cost of restoration (the &quot;Tenant Deficiency Election&quot;). If Tenant does not give Landlord notice of Tenant's Deficiency Election within such thirty (30) day period, Landlord may terminate this Lease or Landlord may elect to restore the Building, in each case pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i) of this Lease. For purposes of this Lease, the phrase &quot;restored to substantially their condition immediately prior to the occurrence of such fire or casualty&quot; shall mean Landlord's Base Building Improvements without the restoration of the improvements to the Premises that constitute Tenant's Work, in respect to which Tenant acknowledges that Tenant, and not Landlord, bears the risk of loss in respect to such fire or other casualty.</p>
          <p id="s1p568">If Tenant makes Tenant's Deficiency Election, Tenant shall promptly deposit with Landlord's mortgagee (or another &quot;restoration trustee&quot; mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant) the amount reasonably estimated by Landlord's architect to fund the estimated cost of the total restoration of the Building (or Premises or Utility Service) to substantially their condition immediately prior to the occurrence of the fire or other casualty after application of the net proceeds of insurance recovered (the &quot;Reconstruction Fund&quot;); all amounts so deposited by Tenant into the Reconstruction Fund shall be referred to herein as &quot;Tenant's Restoration Funds&quot;. Tenant shall have the right to approve the construction cost for the restoration of the Building (or</p>

Landlord's mortgagee (or another &quot;restoration trustee&quot; mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant) shall advance proceeds from the Reconstruction Fund, as needed, to prosecute the restoration as herein provided, and any funds remaining in the Reconstruction Fund after final completion and payment in full of all of the costs of restoration shall be repaid to Tenant. If there is a shortfall in the funding of such restoration, Tenant shall promptly deposit the required additional funds in the Reconstruction Fund after Tenant's receipt of notice from Landlord or Landlord's mortgagee (or another &quot;restoration trustee&quot; mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant) stating the amount of the required additional funds and a description of the restoration work related thereto. Landlord shall have no obligation to repay to Tenant any portion of the Reconstruction Fund. During the period of such restoration, Fixed Rent and Additional Rent shall proportionately abate as set forth in Section 6.1(b)(i) hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p571">(i) Landlord's architect's certificate, given in good faith, shall be deemed conclusive of the statements therein contained and binding upon Tenant with respect to the extent of the damage to the Building and the performance and completion of any repair or restoration work undertaken by Landlord pursuant to Sections 6.1 or 6.2 hereof.</p>

          <p id="s1p573">In the event that the whole or any substantial part of the Building shall be taken or appropriated by eminent domain or shall be condemned for any public or quasi-public use, or (by virtue of any such taking, appropriation or condemnation) shall suffer any damage (direct, indirect or consequential) for which Landlord or Tenant shall be entitled to compensation, then (and in any such event) this Lease and the Term hereof may be terminated at the election of Landlord by a notice in writing of its election so to terminate which shall be given by Landlord to Tenant within ninety (90) days following the date on which Landlord shall have received notice of such taking, appropriation or condemnation. In the event that a substantial part of the Premises or of the means of access thereto or of the Garage Parking Spaces (as such term is defined in Section 10.14 hereof) (unless replaced without undue delay by substitute facilities within a reasonable walking distance from the Building) shall be so taken, appropriated or condemned so as to substantially interfere with the Permitted Uses of the Premises, then this Lease and the Term hereof may be terminated at the election of Tenant by a notice in writing of its election so to terminate which shall be given by Tenant to Landlord within sixty (60) days following the date on which Tenant shall have received notice of such taking, appropriation or condemnation. Substantial part for purposes of this Section 6.2 shall mean thirty-three and one-third percent (331/3%) or more of the Premises or thirty-three and one-third percent (331/3%) or more of the Garage Parking Spaces, as applicable.</p>
          <p id="s1p574">Upon giving of any such notice of termination (either by Landlord or Tenant), this Lease and the Term hereof shall terminate as of the date on which Tenant shall be required to vacate any part of the Premises or shall be deprived of a substantial part of the means of access thereto.

If neither party elects to terminate, Landlord will with reasonable diligence and at Landlord's expense, restore the remainder of the Premises and Building, or the remainder of the means of access and Garage Parking Spaces, to substantially the same condition as practicable as existed prior to such taking, appropriation or condemnation in which event a just proportion of the Annual Fixed Rent and Additional Rent, according to the nature and extent of the taking, appropriation or condemnation and the resultant injury sustained by the Premises and the means of access thereto, shall be abated until what remains of the Premises and the means of access thereto shall have been restored as fully as may be for permanent use and occupancy by Tenant hereunder.

Tenant hereby grants to Landlord all of Tenant's rights to such damages and compensation and covenants to deliver such further assignments thereof as Landlord may from time to time request. It is agreed and understood, however, that Landlord does not reserve to itself, and Tenant does not assign to Landlord, any damages payable for (i) movable trade fixtures installed by Tenant or anybody claiming under Tenant, at Tenant's cost and expense, (ii) relocation expenses or damages for loss of business (in excess of any such damages attributable to the value of this lease) and (iii) the then unamortized cost of Tenant's Work, in each case recoverable by Tenant from such authority in a separate action.</p>

In calculating the rent reserved there shall be included, in addition to the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent, the value of all other considerations agreed to be paid or performed by Tenant during said residue. Tenant further covenants (as additional and cumulative obligations) after any such termination to pay punctually to Landlord all the sums and to perform all the obligations which Tenant covenants in this Lease to pay and to perform in the same manner and to the same extent and at the same time as if this Lease had not been terminated. In calculating the amounts to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the next preceding sentence Tenant shall be credited with any amount paid to Landlord as compensation as in this Section 7.2 provided and also with the net proceeds of any rent obtained by Landlord by reletting the Premises, after deducting all of the Landlord's reasonable expenses in connection with such reletting, including, without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, fees for legal services and expenses of preparing the Premises for such reletting, it being agreed by Tenant that Landlord may (i) relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's option be equal to or less than or exceed the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term and may grant such concessions and free rent as Landlord in its reasonable judgment considers advisable or necessary to relet the same and (ii) make such alterations, repairs and decorations in the Premises as Landlord in its reasonable judgment considers commercially advisable or necessary to relet the same, and no action of Landlord in accordance with the foregoing or failure to relet or to collect rent under reletting shall operate or be construed to release or reduce Tenant's liability as aforesaid.</p>

The receipt by Landlord, or the payment by Tenant, as the case may be, of rent with knowledge of the breach of any covenant of this Lease shall not be deemed to have been a waiver of such breach by Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be. No consent or waiver, express or implied, by Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be, to or of any breach of any agreement or duty shall be construed as a waiver or consent to or of any other breach of the same or any other agreement or duty.</p>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the contrary, including without limitation Section 10.5, no such holder of a mortgage shall be liable either as mortgagee or as assignee to perform, or be liable in damages for failure to perform, any of the obligations of Landlord unless and until such holder shall enter and take possession of the Premises for the purpose of foreclosure or is otherwise deemed to be a mortgagee-in-possession under applicable law, and such holder shall not in any event be liable to perform or for failure to perform the obligations of Landlord under Article III. Upon entry for the purpose of foreclosure, such holder shall be liable to perform all of the obligations of Landlord (except for the obligations under Article III), subject to and with the benefit of the provisions of Section 10.5, provided that a discontinuance of any foreclosure proceeding shall be deemed a conveyance under said provisions to the owner of the equity of the Premises. No Fixed Rent, Additional Rent or any other charge shall be paid more than 10 days prior to the due dates thereof and payments made in violation of this provision shall (except to the extent that such payments are actually received by a mortgagee in possession or in the process of foreclosing its mortgage) be a nullity as against such mortgagee and Tenant shall be liable for the amount of such payments to such mortgagee.</p>

Tenant agrees on request of Landlord to execute and deliver from time to time a Subordination, Non-disturbance and Attornment Agreement (&quot;SNDA&quot;), substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto or any other reasonable agreement which may be necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 hereof.</p>

Tenant and Landlord agree to execute and deliver any appropriate instruments necessary to carry out the agreements contained in this Section 8.2. Any such mortgage to which this Lease shall be subordinate may contain such terms, provisions and conditions as the holder deems usual or customary.</p>

          <p id="s1p671">61</p>
          <p id="s1p672">determined on the basis of the Annual Fixed Rent Rate set forth in Section 1.1 and not pursuant to Section 10.11(c) hereof and (b) Landlord shall have no obligation to make any tenant improvements to the Early Occupancy Space.</p>
          <p id="s1p673">10.12 OPTIONS TO EXTEND.</p>
          <p id="s1p674">(a) Tenant shall have two (2) options to extend the Term of this Lease (the &quot;Options to Extend&quot;) for successive periods of ten (10) years each (the &quot;Extension Periods&quot;), subject to and on the terms set forth herein. Tenant may only exercise the Options to Extend with respect to the entire Premises (including the Expansion Spaces). If Tenant shall desire to exercise either Option to Extend, it shall give Landlord a notice (the &quot;Inquiry Notice&quot;) of such desire not later than twenty-one (21) months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term of this Lease or the preceding Extension Period, as the case may be. Thereafter, the Fair Market Rent (as defined in Subsection (b) below) for the applicable Extension Period shall be determined in accordance with Subsection (e) below. After the applicable Fair Market Rent has been so determined, Tenant may exercise each Option to Extend by giving Landlord written notice (the &quot;Exercise Notice&quot;) of its election to do so not later than (x) the date by which Fair Market Rent has been determined pursuant to this Section 10.12 or (y) eighteen (18) months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term of this Lease, or the preceding Extension Period, as the case may be, whichever is earlier. If Tenant fails to timely give either the Inquiry Notice or the Exercise Notice to Landlord with respect to any Option to Extend, at the sole election of Landlord, Tenant shall be conclusively deemed to have waived such Option to Extend hereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p675">(b) For purposes of this Section 10.12, &quot;Fair Market Rent&quot; shall mean the average of (1) ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair market rental value for unfinished, shell office space in a comparable office building in the Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts office market area (the &quot;Relevant Market&quot;) and (2) ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair market rental value for the Premises, including the Expansion Spaces, and shall take into account all other relevant factors in the Relevant Market, including the ten (10) year term of the applicable Extension Period. In no event shall the Fair Market Rent for the first Extension Period be less than the Annual Fixed Rent for the Premises, including the Expansion Spaces, for the fifteenth Lease Year and in no event shall the Fair Market Rent for the second Extension Period be less than the Annual Fixed Rent for the Premises, including the Expansion Spaces, for the twenty-fifth Lease Year.</p>
          <p id="s1p676">(c) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Lease, each Option to Extend and any exercise by Tenant thereof shall be void and of no force or effect unless on the dates Tenant gives Landlord its Inquiry Notice and Exercise Notice for each Option to Extend and on the date of commencement of each Extension Period (i) this Lease is in full force and effect, (ii) there is no uncured Event of Default of Tenant under this Lease, (iii) Tenant has not assigned this Lease (or agreed to assign this Lease) or subleased (or agreed to sublease) more than forty percent (40%) of the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises, in either case to any person or entity other than an Affiliate of Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p677">(d) All of the terms, provisions, covenants, and conditions of this Lease shall continue to apply during each Extension Period, except that (i) the Annual Fixed Rent during each Extension Period (the &quot;Extension Rent&quot;) shall be equal to the Fair Market Rent for the Premises determined in accordance with Subsection (b) above and the procedure set forth in Subsection (e) below and (ii) Tenant shall not have any other Options to Extend.</p>
          <p id="s1p678">(e) The Fair Market Rent for each Extension Period shall be determined as follows: Within five (5) days after Tenant gives Landlord its Inquiry Notice with respect to either Option to Extend, Landlord shall give Tenant notice of Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rent for the applicable Extension Period. Such determination shall separately identify the two factors used to calculate Fair Market Rent. Within ten (10) days after Tenant receives such notice, Tenant shall notify Landlord of its agreement with or objection to Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rent. If</p>
          <p id="s1p679">62</p>
          <p id="s1p680">Tenant shall notify Landlord of Tenant's objection to Landlord's determination of Fair Market Rent, the Fair Market Rent shall be determined by appraisal in the manner set forth below. If Tenant does not notify Landlord within such ten (10) day period of Tenant's agreement with or objection to Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rent, then the Fair Market Rent for the applicable Extension Period shall be deemed to be Landlord's determination of the Fair Market Rent as set forth in the notice from Landlord described in this subsection.</p>
          <p id="s1p681">If Tenant notifies Landlord of Tenant's objection to Landlord's determination of Fair Market Rent under the preceding subsection, such notice shall also set forth a request for appraisal and Tenant's appointment of a commercial real estate broker having at least ten (10) years experience in the commercial leasing market in the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts (an &quot;Appraiser&quot;). Within five (5) days thereafter, Landlord shall by notice to Tenant appoint a second Appraiser. In determining the Fair Market Rent, each of the Appraisers appointed by Landlord and Tenant shall separately identify the two separate factors used to calculate Fair Market Rent. Each Appraiser shall determine the Fair Market Rent for the applicable Extension Period within thirty (30) days after Landlord's appointment of the second Appraiser. On or before the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the two Appraisers shall confer to compare their respective determinations of the Fair Market Rent. If the difference between the amounts so determined by the two Appraisers is less than or equal to ten percent (10%) of the lower of said amounts, then the final determination of the Fair Market Rent shall be equal to the average of said amounts. If such difference between said amounts is greater than ten percent (10%), then the two Appraisers shall have ten (10) days thereafter to appoint a third Appraiser (the &quot;Third Appraiser&quot;), who shall be instructed to determine the Fair Market Rent for the applicable Extension Period within ten (10) days after its appointment by selecting one of the amounts determined by the other two Appraisers. If the two Appraisers are unable to agree upon the Third Appraiser within such ten (10) day period, such Third Appraiser shall be appointed by the then President of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board upon request of either Landlord or Tenant. Each party shall bear the cost of the Appraiser selected by such party. The cost for the Third Appraiser, if any, shall be shared equally by Landlord and Tenant. Each Appraiser and Landlord shall be given reasonable access to the Premises for purposes of determining Fair Market Rent.</p>

Judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.</p>
          <p id="s1p684">Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes with respect to whether (i) the Schematic Design Documents are in compliance with the Preliminary Design Concept, (ii) the Design Development Documents are in compliance with the Schematic Design Development Documents, or (iii) the Final Design Documents are in compliance with the Design Development Documents, shall be summarily decided by the Arbitrator and disputes concerning the achievement of the Substantial Completion Date shall be determined by the Arbitrator, in each case without resort to formal arbitration under the Construction Industry Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the Arbitrator's decision thereon shall be binding on the parties. Otherwise, such disputes shall be resolved in arbitration as set forth herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p685">Arbitration proceedings under this Section 10.13 shall, upon motion of any party, be consolidated with arbitration proceedings pending between other parties relating to the Landlord's Work, the same transaction, the same subject matter, and/or involving related substantive rights. All parties hereby consent to such consolidation. In addition to the foregoing, any party to any agreement, whose rights or</p>

          <p id="s1p687">performance is involved in an arbitration proceeding hereunder, may be joined as a party in any arbitration proceeding instituted hereunder. Consolidation and joinder hereunder shall be by order of the Arbitrator. If the Arbitrator shall fail, upon motion, to make such an order, any party may apply to the Superior Court for Middlesex County, Massachusetts for such an order. Neither party nor the Arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. All administrative fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties. Each party shall bear the expense of its own counsel, experts, witnesses, and preparation and presentation of proofs.</p>
          <p id="s1p688">There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be experienced as an arbitrator and who shall be either a registered engineer, architect, or general contractor engaged in business in Massachusetts, for at least ten (10) years, and familiar with issues generally similar to those in dispute, and who shall not have had any dealings with either party within the five-year period immediately preceding such dispute (the &quot;Arbitrator&quot;). If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Arbitrator within ten (10) days after submission of a dispute to arbitration, then either Landlord or Tenant may request that the then President of the Boston Bar Association select the Arbitrator. Each party shall bear half the cost of the Arbitrator. The right to arbitrate shall not be deemed to be a limitation of the rights or remedies of either party in aid of arbitration under any and all applicable laws, unless expressly waived, by such party hereto. All arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

Tenant shall pay monthly, in advance, as Additional Rent the Valet Parking Fee for each Valet Parking Space. Employees of Tenant visiting the Complex from other facilities may use the Garage, subject to availability, at the daily rate charged by the Garage Owner, provided, however, Landlord and Tenant agree to implement a parking ticket validation system so that employees of Tenant visiting the Complex from other facilities of Tenant may use any unused Valet Parking Spaces.

If Landlord has not leased the ROFR Space to a third party within such 180-day period, or if Landlord proposes to offer the ROFR Space for lease to a third party on terms and conditions more favorable to such third party than the final terms offered to Tenant during the ROFR Negotiation Period, Landlord shall first re-offer the ROFR Space to Tenant hereunder before Landlord may offer the ROFR Space to any third party, and Tenant shall have five (5) business days within which to accept such offer.

Landlord may provide a manned security desk within the lobby of the Building comparable to that of other buildings in the Complex, it being understood by Tenant that the provision of a security desk and security card systems are no warranty, representation or guaranty by Landlord as to the safety or security of persons and property within the Building or the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Tenant shall be solely responsible for the security of all persons and property within the Premises and for access to the Premises including any security card system serving the Premises.

The Lease now is, and shall at all times and for all purposes continue to be, subject and subordinate, in each and every respect, to the Mortgage, with the provisions of the Mortgage (including but not limited to the provisions of the Mortgage pertaining to the application of insurance proceeds and condemnation awards) controlling in all respects over the provisions of the Lease; moreover the Lease is subordinate and subject, in each and every respect, to any and all increases, renewals, modifications, extensions, and/or consolidations of the Mortgage, and all other loan documents securing the Note, provided that any and all such increases, renewals, modifications, extensions and/or consolidations shall nevertheless be subject to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
          <p id="s1p958">2. Non-Disturbance. So long as Tenant is not in default (beyond any period given Tenant to cure such default in the Lease) in the payment of rent or additional rent or in the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Lease on Tenant' s part to be performed, (i) Tenant' s possession, occupancy, use and quiet enjoyment of the Demised Premises and Tenant's other rights and options under the Lease, or any extensions or renewals thereof or acquisition of additional space, which may be effected in accordance with any option therefor in the Lease, shall not be terminated or interfered with by Lender in the exercise of any of its rights under the Mortgage, or as may otherwise be provided for at law or in equity and (ii) Lender will not join Tenant as a party defendant in any action or proceeding for the purpose of terminating Tenant' s interest and estate under the Lease because of any default under the Mortgage.</p>
          <p id="s1p959">3. Attornment. If any proceedings are brought for the foreclosure of the Mortgage or if the Property is sold pursuant to a power of sale under the Mortgage, or Lender shall succeed to the interest of Landlord under the Lease in any manner, Tenant shall attorn and be bound to such party (whether Lender or another party) upon any such succession in interest or foreclosure sale and shall recognize such party as the Landlord under the Lease. Such attornment shall be effective and self-operative without the execution of any further instrument on the part of any of the parties hereto. Tenant agrees, however, to execute and deliver at any time and from time to time, upon the request of Lender or of any holder(s) of any of the indebtedness or other obligations secured by the Mortgage or any purchaser of the Property at a foreclosure sale, any instrument or certificate which may be necessary or appropriate (in any such foreclosure proceeding or</p>
          <p id="s1p960">otherwise) to evidence such attornment. In the event of any such attornment, Tenant further waives the provisions of any statute or rule of law, now or hereafter in effect, which may give or purport to give Tenant any right or election to terminate or otherwise adversely affect the Lease and the obligation of Tenant thereunder as a result of any such foreclosure proceeding.</p>
          <p id="s1p961">4. Obligations of Lender. If Lender shall succeed to the interest of the Landlord under the Lease, or if any purchaser acquires the Property, upon any foreclosure of the Mortgage, Lender or such purchaser, as the case may be, shall have the same remedies by entry, action or otherwise in the event of any default by Tenant (beyond any period given Tenant to cure such default) in the payment of rent or additional rent by Tenant or in the performance of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be performed that the Landlord under the Lease had or would have had if Lender or such purchaser had not succeeded to the interest of Landlord. From and after any such attornment, Lender or such purchaser shall be bound to Tenant under all of the terms, covenants, and conditions of the Lease, and Tenant shall, from and after the succession to the interest of Landlord under the Lease by Lender or such purchaser, have the same remedies against Lender or such purchaser for the breach of any agreement contained in the Lease that Tenant might have had under the Lease against the Landlord if Lender or such purchaser had not succeeded to the interest of Landlord; provided further, however, that Lender or such purchaser shall not be liable or bound to Tenant as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p962">(a) for any act or omission of any prior landlord (including Landlord) provided, however, that nothing in this clause (a) shall release Lender or any such purchaser, after such attornment, from any obligation of a prior landlord to: (i) reconstruct or repair the Property following any fire, casualty or condemnation which may have occurred prior to such attornment, to the extent that insurance proceeds or condemnation awards are available and otherwise as required under Article VI of the Lease; or (ii) perform any on-going maintenance, repair and/or Building operation obligations of the prior landlord under the Lease even if the need for such item of repair, maintenance or Building operation arose prior to such attornment; and provided further, nothing in this clause (a) shall affect or limit Tenant's express rights to terminate the Lease under Sections 3.1.1, 3.2 and 6.1 of the Lease under the applicable circumstances set forth in each such section; or</p>
          <p id="s1p963">(b) for any offsets or defenses which Tenant might have against any landlord (including Landlord); or</p>
          <p id="s1p964">(c) for or by any rent or additional rent which Tenant has paid for more than the current month or the next succeeding month to any prior landlord (including Landlord) unless such rent payment is actually paid or credited to Lender or such purchaser by the prior landlord; or</p>
          <p id="s1p965">(d) by any amendment or modification of the Lease made without Lender's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed if Lender determines that such amendment or modification will not materially and adversely affect the value of the Lease as collateral security for the Note; or</p>
          <p id="s1p966">(e) for any security deposit, rental deposit or other deposit paid by Tenant to a prior landlord (including Landlord) unless such deposit is actually paid over or credited to Lender or such purchaser by the prior landlord;</p>
          <p id="s1p967">(f) by any notice of a landlord default given by Tenant to a prior landlord (including Landlord) unless a copy thereof was also then given to Lender in accordance with this Agreement; or</p>
          <p id="s1p968">(g) under any indemnification provisions set forth in the lease or for any damages Tenant may suffer as a result of any false representation set forth in the Lease, the breach of any warranty</p>
          <p id="s1p969">2</p>
          <p id="s1p970">set forth in the Lease, or any act of, or failure to act by any party other than Lender or such purchaser, as applicable.</p>
          <p id="s1p971">Further, in such event any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards relating to the Property shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage and not the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p972">The person or entity to whom Tenant attorns shall be liable to Tenant under the Lease only to the extent of the interest of such person or entity in the Premises, the Building and the Lot (as such terms are defined in the Lease) and only for matters arising during such person's or entity's period of ownership, and such liability shall terminate upon the transfer by such person or entity of its interest in the Lease and the Property and the assumption of such liability by the transferee.</p>
          <p id="s1p973">Lender hereby agrees that if at the time of such attornment (x) Landlord has commenced but not substantially completed Landlord's Work and (y) Tenant has commenced Tenant's Work, then in order to complete Landlord's Work, (i) Lender may elect to complete Landlord's Work, (ii) Lender may elect to advance to Tenant, in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage or the other loan documents executed in connection therewith, the then undisbursed proceeds of Lender's loan evidenced by the Note, in which event such loan proceeds shall be included in Project Cost (as such term is defined in the Lease) for purposes of calculating Annual Fixed Rent (as such term is defined in the Lease) payable by Tenant, or (iii) if Lender does not elect to substantially complete Landlord's Work or advance such loan proceeds, Tenant may advance funds to complete Landlord's Work, in which event Tenant shall receive an abatement of Annual Fixed Rent, commencing on the Rent Commencement Date, in an amount equal to the funds so advanced from time to time by Tenant with interest thereon at the non-default rate of interest set forth in the Note on the outstanding amount of such advances and continuing until such abatement is exhausted. If Lender does not elect to complete Landlord's Work or if Lender elects to complete Landlord's Work but fails to substantially complete Landlord's Work by the Outside Completion Date, Tenant, shall have the right to terminate the Lease in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 3.2 of the Lease. If, however, Lender elects to advance to Tenant the then undisbursed proceeds of Lender's loan in accordance with clause (ii) hereof or Tenant advances funds to complete Landlord's Work in accordance with clause (iii) hereof, Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 3.2 of the Lease if Landlord's Work is not substantially complete by the Outside Completion Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p974">5. Rent Payment. Tenant agrees to pay all rents directly to Lender in accordance with the Lease immediately upon receipt of written notice of Lender's succeeding to the Landlord's interest under the Lease or upon receipt of written notice that Lender is exercising its rights under the Mortgage or any other loan documents which secure the Note following a default by Landlord or other applicable party. Tenant shall be entitled to full credit under the Lease to the extent of all rents paid to Lender pursuant to this paragraph of this Agreement. By its signature to and consent to this Agreement, Landlord agrees to this paragraph and releases Tenant from any liability to Landlord to the extent of the payment of all rents delivered to Lender under this provision.</p>
          <p id="s1p975">6. Notice of Mortgage. To the extent that the Lease shall entitle the Tenant to notice of any mortgage or security agreement, this Agreement shall constitute such notice to the Tenant with respect to the Mortgage.</p>
          <p id="s1p976">7. Successor of Lender. The term &quot;Lender&quot; as used throughout this Agreement includes any successor, assigns or holder(s) in interest of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage.</p>
          <p id="s1p977">8. Landlord Defaults. Tenant agrees with Lender that effective as of the date of this Agreement: (i) that Tenant shall not take any steps to terminate the Lease for any default by Landlord or any succeeding owner of the Property until after giving Lender written notice of such default, stating the nature of the default and giving Lender thirty (30) days from receipt of such</p>
          <p id="s1p978">3</p>
          <p id="s1p979">notice to effect a cure of the same, or if a cure cannot be effected within said thirty (30) days due to the nature of the default, Lender shall have a reasonable time to cure provided that it commences to cure within said thirty (30) day period of time and diligently pursues such cure to completion; and (ii) that notice to the Landlord under the Lease (oral or written) shall not constitute notice to Lender. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Section 8 to the contrary: (x) Tenant shall be entitled to exercise its express rights to terminate the Lease under Section 3.1.1 and its express rights to terminate the Lease under Section 3.2 on account of the failure of the Landlord to have achieved any of the Landlord Milestone Dates, as the same may be extended by any Tenant Delay (as such term is defined in the Lease), upon giving Lender the same notice and right to cure as Tenant is required to give to Landlord pursuant to Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2 of the Lease; and (y) with respect to Tenant's other express rights to terminate the Lease under Section 3.2, the period of time specified above in this Section during which Lender may diligently seek to cure shall in no event extend beyond the Outside Completion Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p980">9. No Abridgment. Nothing herein contained is intended, nor shall it be, construed to abridge or adversely affect any right or remedy of the Landlord under the Lease in the event of any default by Tenant (beyond any period given Tenant to cure such default) in the payment of rent or additional rent or in the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be performed.</p>
          <p id="s1p981">10. No Amendment or Termination of Lease. Lender and Tenant agree that Tenant's interest in and obligations under the Lease shall not be (i) altered or modified without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned if Lender determines that such amendment or modification will not materially and adversely affect the value of the Lease as collateral security for the Note or (ii) terminated (other than in accordance with the express terms of the Lease and this Agreement) without the prior written consent of Lender. Lender and Tenant also agree that Tenant shall neither assign the Lease or allow it to be assigned in any manner nor sublet the Demised Premises or any part thereof without the prior written consent of Lender in any situation where Landlord' s consent to any such action is required under the Lease. Lender agrees that its consent to any such assignment or subletting shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed if Lender determines that such assignment or subletting will not materially and adversely affect the value of the Lease as collateral security for the Note.</p>
          <p id="s1p982">11. Interpretation. This Agreement may not be modified orally or in any manner other than by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto or their respective successors in interest. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their successors and assigns, and any purchaser or purchasers at foreclosure of the Property, and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. This Agreement is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

          <p id="s1p1011">THIS ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENT, (&quot;Agreement&quot;), is entered into as of the day of , 2000 by and between KENDALL SQUARE, LLC a Delaware limited liability company, having an address at 101 Main Street, 18th Floor, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142 (&quot;Landlord&quot;), and GENZYME CORPORATION, a Massachusetts corporation having an address of One Kendall Square, Building 1400, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 (&quot;Tenant&quot;), and is made in conjunction with a Lease dated the date hereof (the &quot;Lease&quot;) by and between Landlord and Tenant, regarding the Lot, as described and defined in the Lease, located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts (the Lot is hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Property&quot;).</p>
          <p id="s1p1012">RECITALS</p>
          <p id="s1p1013">A. Landlord is the current owner of the Property, having acquired the right, title and interest of Com/Energy Research Park Realty (&quot;Com/Energy&quot;) in the Property, together with certain other real property (approximately ten acres of land, including the Property, hereinafter the &quot;Cambridge Research Park Site&quot;). In connection with the acquisition of the Cambridge Research Park Site by Landlord, Landlord entered into a Release and Indemnity Agreement and a Remediation Agreement, both of which are by and between Com/Energy and CRP and dated August 18, 1998 (hereinafter the &quot;Release and Indemnity Agreement&quot;and the &quot;Remediation Agreement&quot;), which govern certain rights, responsibilities, releases, indemnities and remediation obligations with respect to the Cambridge Research Park Site, including the Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p1014">B. Landlord and Com/Energy have made commitments to each other pursuant to the Release and Indemnity Agreement and the Remediation Agreement, including commitments with respect to the Property. These commitments include, among others, (1) the commitment by Landlord to release and indemnify Com/Energy for certain matters relating to the environmental condition of the Cambridge Research Park Site, including the Property, and the remediation thereof, and (2) the commitment by Landlord to require its lessees to agree to be bound by certain terms of the Release and Indemnity Agreement and the Remediation Agreement.</p>
          <p id="s1p1015">In consideration of the Recitals stated above and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and solely with respect to the Property (and no other properties), the parties agree as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p1016">1. Definitions. All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the definitions set forth in the Release and Indemnity Agreement and the Remediation Agreement, as indicated herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p1017">2. Release and Indemnity Agreement. A copy of the Release and Indemnity Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit A.</p>
          <p id="s1p1018">(a) Release. Tenant acknowledges that it is a Releasing Party as that term is defined in the Release and Indemnity Agreement and expressly understands and agrees that the Release and Indemnity Agreement runs with the land, which includes the Property, and is binding upon Tenant, except as otherwise provided herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p1019">(b) Indemnity. The parties acknowledge that Paragraph 5 of the Release and Indemnity Agreement provides in part that Landlord may perform remediation and subsequent development at the Cambridge Research Park Site, including the Property, on a phased-basis and that for each such phase, the Indemnity Expiration Date (as that term is defined in the Release and Indemnity Agreement) with respect to Releasing Parties (as that term is defined in the Release and Indemnity Agreement) which are owners, successors or assigns to such remediated phases of the Cambridge Research Park Site shall occur on the later to occur of the RAO Date or the Foundation Date (as those terms are defined in the Release and Indemnity Agreement), for claims made thereafter.</p>
          <p id="s1p1020">Prior to the Substantial Completion Date (as such term is defined in the Lease) Landlord will deliver to Tenant (i) the certification of Landlord's Licensed Site Professional certifying that the RAO has been completed in accordance with the MCP with respect to the Property and (ii) an estoppel</p>
          <p id="s1p1021">certificate of COM/Energy pursuant to Paragraph 15 of the Release and Indemnity Agreement certifying, to the best of COM/Energy's knowledge, there is no default on the part of Landlord under the Release and Indemnity Agreement and further stating that the Indemnity Expiration Date has occurred with respect to the Property.</p>

          <p id="s1p1023">The parties acknowledge that the Remediation Agreement provides in part that: The Remediation Agreement shall be binding upon Landlord, its successors, heirs, administrators and assigns and with respect to the remediation obligations set forth therein, the Remediation Agreement shall run with the land, consisting of all or any portion of the Cambridge Research Park Site, including the Property, be binding upon any and all subsequent owners, ground tenants, and mortgagees of the Cambridge Research Park Site, including the Property, or any portion thereof or interest therein. The Remediation Agreement further provides that notwithstanding the preceding sentence, that (a) Landlord may, at its election, perform its remediation and development obligations under the Remediation Agreement in phases and (b) with respect to any subsequent owner, ground tenant or mortgagee of any such phase or any portion thereof, the remediation obligation set forth in the Remediation Agreement shall not be binding upon any such subsequent owner, ground tenant or mortgagee, provided the obligations under the Remediation Agreement have been satisfied with respect to such phase. Prior to the Substantial Completion Date Landlord shall deliver to Tenant (i) the certification of Landlord's Licensed Site Professional certifying that the RAO has been completed in accordance with the MCP with respect to the Property and (ii) an estoppel certificate of COM/Energy pursuant to Paragraph 14 of the Remediation Agreement certifying, to the best of COM/Energy's knowledge, there is no default on the part of Landlord under the Remediation Agreement and further stating that COM/Energy has approved the RAO and that Landlord has satisfied Landlord's obligations under the Remediation Agreement with respect to the Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p1024">4. Landlord Indemnity of Tenant. Effective as of the date hereof, Landlord agrees to defend, hold harmless and indemnify Tenant from and against any and all claims, fees, costs, disbursements and expenses that may be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted or awarded against Tenant that relate to or arise from the presence, release or threatened release of, or the mitigation or remediation of, any Hazardous Materials (as defined herein) on, at or below the Property, including migration onto the Property from the Cambridge Research Park Site, for which Landlord is responsible or liable pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Remediation Agreement or the Release and Indemnity Agreement or for which Landlord is responsible or liable pursuant to the operation of the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Materials Release Prevention and Response Act, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, as amended (&quot;Chapter 21E&quot;).

          <p id="s1p1026">5. Tenant Indemnity of Landlord. Tenant, for itself and for each of the other Transferring Parties (as hereinafter defined), jointly and severally, agrees to defend, hold harmless and indemnify Landlord</p>
          <p id="s1p1027">2</p>

          <p id="s1p1029">6. Site Access Upon MADEP Audit of RAO. The parties acknowledge that pursuant to Chapter 21E and the MCP, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (&quot;MADEP&quot;) may perform an audit of the RAO documentation submitted to MADEP for the Property.

Tenant hereby agrees to cooperate with Landlord to the extent reasonably necessary to respond to any audit by MADEP.</p>

          <p id="s1p1070">14. Dispute Resolution.

          <p id="s1p1078">vi. The arbitrators shall have the authority to grant injunctive relief and order specific performance.</p>
          <p id="s1p1079">vii. No party shall be eligible to receive, and the arbitrators shall not have the authority to award, exemplary or punitive damages.</p>
          <p id="s1p1080">viii.

This Agreement, together with Exhibits hereto, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties delivered pursuant hereto, constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among Landlord and Tenant with respect to the subject matter hereof and are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of the Lease.
