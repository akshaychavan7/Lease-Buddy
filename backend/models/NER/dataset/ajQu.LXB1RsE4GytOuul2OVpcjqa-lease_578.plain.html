          <p id="s1p141">1. PROPERTY</p>
          <p id="s1p142">1.1 Lease of Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p143">(a) Landlord leases to Tenant and Tenant hires and leases from Landlord, on the terms, covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, the premises (the “)Premises” consisting of approximately 124,274 square feet of space constituting the building commonly known as 2081 Stierlin Court (the “)Building” located in the Britannia Shoreline Technology Park (referred to interchangeably herein as the “or the Center” “)Property” in the City of Mountain View, County of Santa Clara, State of California.

          <p id="s1p144">(b) As an appurtenance to Tenant’s leasing of the Premises pursuant to Section 1.1 (a), Landlord hereby grants to Tenant, for the benefit of Tenant and its employees, suppliers, shippers, customers and invitees, during the term of this Lease, the non-exclusive right to use, in common with others entitled to such use, (i) those portions of the Common Areas improved from time to time for use as parking areas, driveways, sidewalks, landscaped areas, or for other common purposes, and (ii) all access easements and similar rights and privileges relating to or appurtenant to the Center and created or existing from time to time under any access easement agreements, declarations of covenants, conditions and restrictions, or other written agreements now or hereafter of record with respect to the Center, subject however to any limitations applicable to such rights and privileges under applicable law, under this Lease and/or under the written agreements creating such rights and privileges.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">1.2 Landlord’s Reserved Rights. To the extent reasonably necessary to permit Landlord to exercise any rights of Landlord and discharge any obligations of Landlord under this Lease, Landlord shall have, in addition to the right of entry set forth in Section 12.1 hereof, the following rights: (i) to make changes to the Common Areas, including, without limitation, changes in the location, size or shape of any portion of the Common Areas, and to construct and/or relocate parking structures and/or parking spaces in the Center; (ii) to close temporarily any of the Common Areas for maintenance or other reasonable purposes; (iii) to construct, alter or add to other buildings and Common Area improvements in the Center; (iv) to use the Common Areas while engaged in making additional improvements, repairs or alterations to the Center or any portion thereof; and (v) to do and perform such other acts with respect to the Common Areas and the Center as may be necessary or appropriate. Landlord shall not exercise rights reserved to it pursuant to this Section 1.2 in such a manner as to cause any material diminution of Tenant’s rights, or any material increase of Tenant’s obligations, under this Lease, or in such a manner as to leave Tenant without reasonable parking or reasonable access to the Premises or otherwise to materially impair Tenant’s ability to conduct its activities in the normal manner; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit or restrict Landlord’s right to undertake reasonable construction activity and Tenant’s use of the Premises shall be subject to reasonable temporary disruption incidental to such activity diligently prosecuted.</p>
          <p id="s1p146">1.3 First Refusal Right to Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">(a) The building commonly known as 2091 Stierlin Court and designated as “First Refusal Building” on the Site Plan (the “,First Refusal Building”) consisting of approximately 65,604 square feet, is presently leased and occupied by an existing tenant (the “pursuant to a written lease agreement (as it now exists and as it may be amended from time to time, the Existing Tenant”) “.Existing Lease”) Landlord shall not lease all or any portion of the First Refusal Building at any time during the term of this Lease (including any extended terms, if applicable), except in compliance with this Section 1.3; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply during any period in which Tenant is in default under this Lease, beyond any applicable notice and cure periods, and provided further, however, that Tenant’s rights pursuant to this Section 1.3 are subordinate to the rights of the Existing Tenant and its successors in interest (if any) pursuant to the Existing Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p148">(b) If, at any time during the term of this Lease (including any extended terms, if applicable), Landlord receives and wishes to accept a bona fide written offer from a person or entity (an “Offeror,” provided, however, that the term “Offeror” shall not include Tenant itself, nor shall it include the Existing Tenant with respect to any rights or negotiations under the Existing Lease) to lease all or any portion of the First Refusal Building, or if Landlord and a third party otherwise have agreed upon the terms for such a lease, and if in either such event Tenant is not then in default under this Lease (beyond any applicable notice and cure periods), then Landlord shall give written notice of such bona fide written offer or agreement to Tenant (the “,First Refusal Notice”) specifying the material terms on which the Offeror proposes to lease the First Refusal Building or applicable portion thereof (a “,First Refusal Space”) and shall offer to Tenant the opportunity to lease such First Refusal Space on the terms specified in the First Refusal Notice. For purposes of this Section 1.3(b), an offer shall be considered bona fide if it is contained in a letter of intent or other writing signed by the Offeror</p>

          <p id="s1p150">and specifies the material terms of the proposed lease. Tenant shall have ten (10) business days after the date of giving of the First Refusal Notice in which to accept such offer by written notice to Landlord. Upon such acceptance by Tenant, the First Refusal Space shall be leased to Tenant on the terms set forth in the First Refusal Notice and on the additional terms and provisions set forth in this Lease (except to the extent inconsistent with the terms set forth in the First Refusal Notice), and the parties shall promptly (and in all events within ten (10) business days after delivery of Tenant’s acceptance) execute a lease amendment or other written agreement containing the terms of the First Refusal Notice and containing or incorporating all other terms and provisions of this Lease not inconsistent with the terms of said First Refusal Notice, except as the parties may otherwise mutually agree; provided, however, that the failure of the parties to execute such a lease amendment or other agreement shall not impair the validity or the legally binding nature of Tenant’s leasing of the First Refusal Space pursuant to its acceptance of the offer set forth in the First Refusal Notice, and Tenant’s written acceptance of such offer shall be sufficient to cause the parties to be mutually bound by Tenant’s leasing of the First Refusal Space on the terms set forth in the First Refusal Notice and on the additional terms and provisions set forth in this Lease (except to the extent inconsistent with the terms set forth in the First Refusal Notice). If Tenant does not accept Landlord’s offer within the allotted time, Landlord shall thereafter have the right to lease the First Refusal Space to the Offeror or to any other third party, at any time within one hundred eighty (180) days after the expiration of Landlord’s offer under the First Refusal Notice, at a minimum rental and on other terms and conditions not materially more favorable to the lessee than the minimum rental and other terms offered to Tenant in the First Refusal Notice. If, in the course of negotiations with the Offeror or another third party during the 180-day period described in the preceding sentence, Landlord wishes to modify the minimum rental or other terms set forth in the First Refusal Notice in a manner materially more favorable to the Offeror or other third party than the minimum rental or other terms set forth in the First Refusal Notice, then Landlord shall be required to re-offer the First Refusal Space to Tenant on such more favorable terms pursuant to a new First Refusal Notice, but Tenant’s time to respond to such new First Refusal Notice shall be limited to five (5) business days. If Landlord does not lease the First Refusal Space to the Offeror or another third party during the 180-day period described above, or if Landlord leases the First Refusal Space to the Offeror or another third party and Landlord later, upon expiration or termination of such lease, again wishes to lease the First Refusal Space or any portion thereof during the term of this Lease (including any extended terms, if applicable), then in either such event this First Refusal Right shall reattach to the First Refusal Space on all of the same terms set forth above.</p>

Acceptance of any late charge by Landlord shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant’s default with respect to overdue rental or other amounts, nor shall such acceptance prevent Landlord from exercising any other rights and remedies available to it. Acceptance of rent or other payments by Landlord shall not constitute a waiver of late charges or interest accrued with respect to such rent or other payments or any prior installments thereof, nor of any other defaults by Tenant, whether monetary or non-monetary in nature, remaining uncured at the time of such acceptance of rent or other payments.</p>

If at any time or times it appears to Landlord that the actual Operating Expenses for an Expense Year will vary from Landlord’s previous estimate by more than five percent (5%), Landlord may, by notice to Tenant, revise its estimate for the applicable Expense Year and subsequent payments by Tenant for such Expense Year shall be based upon such revised estimate.</p>

If on the basis of such statement Tenant owes an amount that is more or less than the estimated payments for such Expense Year previously made by Tenant, Tenant or Landlord, as the case may be, shall pay the deficiency to the other party within thirty (30) days after delivery of the statement.

Any such independent audit of the books and records shall be conducted by a certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to both Landlord and Tenant or, if the parties are unable to agree, by a certified public accountant appointed by the Presiding Judge of the Santa Clara County Superior Court upon the application of either Landlord or Tenant (with notice to the other party). In either event, such certified public accountant shall be one who is not then employed in any capacity by Landlord or Tenant or by any of their respective affiliates. The audit shall be limited to the determination of the amount of Operating Expenses for the subject Expense Year, and shall be based on generally accepted accounting principles and tax accounting principles, consistently applied. If it is determined, by mutual agreement of Landlord and Tenant or by independent audit, that the amount of Operating Expenses billed to or paid by Tenant for the applicable Expense Year was incorrect, then the appropriate party shall pay to the other party the deficiency or overpayment, as applicable, within thirty (30) days after the final determination of such deficiency or overpayment. All costs and expenses of the audit shall be paid by Tenant unless the audit shows that Landlord overstated Operating Expenses for the subject Expense Year by more than five percent (5%), in which case Landlord shall pay all costs and expenses of the audit.

To the extent Tenant provides Landlord with timely written notice of any such objections or claims, Landlord and Tenant shall cooperate reasonably and in good faith to try to resolve the objections or claims raised by Tenant, which cooperation may include the use of an independent audit initiated by Tenant as contemplated above.

It is the intention of the parties that all such services shall be separately metered to the Premises. In the event that any utilities or services supplied to the Premises are not separately metered, then the amount thereof shall be allocated in a reasonable, good faith and appropriate manner by Landlord between the Premises and the other buildings, premises or areas sharing such utilities or services, and the portion thereof allocable to the Building may, in Landlord’s discretion, either be included in Operating Expenses allocable to the Building under Section 5.1 hereof or be billed directly to Tenant and paid or reimbursed by Tenant within ten (10) business days after receipt of Landlord’s statement and request for payment, accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation evidencing the calculation or determination of the amount for which payment or reimbursement is requested.

          <p id="s1p573">(B) If there are code requirements or other legal compliance requirements which become applicable to or enforceable against the Building or existing improvements therein as a result of the particular nature of the Tenant Improvements (such as, but not limited to, installation of manufacturing or other equipment which triggers seismic, vibration, firewall, sprinkler, life safety, ventilation or other requirements that would not apply in the absence of the installation and use of such equipment), or which become applicable to or enforceable against the Building or existing improvements only as a result of or in connection with later phases of the Tenant Improvements constructed after substantial completion of the initial phase of the Tenant Improvements, then Tenant shall be responsible for complying with such requirements and the cost of such compliance shall be part of the Cost of Improvements for the Tenant Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p574">(c) Changes. If Tenant at any time desires to make any changes, alterations or additions to the Approved Plans, such changes, alterations or additions shall be subject to approval by Landlord in the same manner as the original Approved Plans as provided above, except that Landlord shall be deemed to have approved such changes, alterations or additions if Landlord fails to respond with its written approval or disapproval thereof within five (5) business days after they are submitted to Landlord for approval.</p>
          <p id="s1p575">B – 3</p>
          <p id="s1p576">(d) Project Management. Unless and until revoked by Landlord by written notice delivered to Tenant, Landlord hereby (i) delegates to Project Manager the authority to exercise all approval rights, supervisory rights and other rights and powers of Landlord under this Workletter with respect to the design and construction of the Tenant Improvements, and (ii) requests that Tenant work with Project Manager with respect to any logistical or other coordination matters arising in the course of construction of the Tenant Improvements, including (but not limited to) reviewing and processing Tenant’s requests for disbursement of the Tenant Improvement Allowance, monitoring Tenant’s and Landlord’s compliance with their respective obligations under this Workletter and under the Lease with respect to the design and construction of the Tenant Improvements, and addressing any coordination issues that may arise from any concurrent performance of Landlord’s Work under Section 2.3 of the Lease and Tenant’s construction of the Tenant Improvements. Tenant acknowledges the foregoing delegation and request, and agrees to cooperate reasonably with Project Manager as Landlord’s representative pursuant to such delegation and request. As between Landlord and Tenant, however, Landlord shall be bound by and be fully responsible for all acts and omissions of Project Manager and for the performance of all of Landlord’s obligations under the Lease and this Workletter, notwithstanding such delegation of authority to Project Manager. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, neither Landlord’s delegation of authority to Project Manager nor Project Manager’s performance of the functions and responsibilities contemplated in this paragraph shall cause Landlord or Project Manager to incur any obligations or responsibilities for the design, construction or delivery of the Tenant Improvements, except to the extent of the specific obligations and responsibilities expressly set forth in the Lease and in this Workletter. A project management fee of Seventy-Five Cents ($0.75) per square foot (total fee of $93,205.50) for Project Manager’s services shall be charged against the Tenant Improvement Allowance; all other fees and charges of Project Manager for services rendered to or on behalf of Landlord under this Workletter shall be at Landlord’s sole expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p577">3. Payment of Costs.</p>
          <p id="s1p578">(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Workletter, in the Lease or by mutual written agreement of Landlord and Tenant, the cost of construction of the Tenant Improvements shall be paid or reimbursed by Landlord up to a maximum contribution by Landlord equal to Nine Million Nine Hundred Forty-One Thousand Nine Hundred Twenty and No/100 Dollars ($9,941,920.00) toward the Cost of Improvements for such Tenant Improvements (the “),Tenant Improvement Allowance” less any reduction in or charge against such sums pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Lease or of this Workletter. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Workletter or in the Lease, Tenant shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for payment of the entire Cost of Improvements of the Tenant Improvements in the Premises in excess of the Tenant Improvement Allowance or such portion thereof as Tenant elects to use (if any such excess occurs), including (but not limited to) any costs or cost increases incurred as a result of unavoidable delays, governmental requirements or unanticipated conditions, but Tenant shall be entitled to utilize the entire Tenant Improvement Allowance (or so much thereof as Tenant elects to use) for the Tenant Improvements prior to being required to expend any of Tenant’s own funds on an unreimbursed basis for the Tenant Improvements (except to the extent any costs are incurred which are not eligible for payment or reimbursement out of the Tenant Improvement Allowance under the express provisions governing the Tenant Improvement Allowance, including, without limitation, the express</p>
          <p id="s1p579">B – 4</p>
          <p id="s1p580">restrictions set forth below in this paragraph). The funding of the Tenant Improvement Allowance (or so much thereof as Tenant elects to use) shall be made on a monthly basis or at other convenient intervals mutually approved by Landlord and Tenant, and in all other respects shall be based on such commercially reasonable disbursement conditions and procedures as Landlord, Project Manager and Landlord’s lender (if any) may reasonably prescribe (which conditions may include, without limitation, delivery of invoices, architect’s certifications and/or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord or Project Manager that expenses have been incurred for the design and construction of alterations and improvements for which the Tenant Improvement Allowance is eligible to be expended or applied, and delivery of conditional or unconditional lien releases from all parties performing the applicable work). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, (i) under no circumstances shall the Tenant Improvement Allowance or any portion thereof be used or useable for any moving or relocation expenses of Tenant, or for any Cost of Improvement (or any other cost or expense) associated with any moveable furniture, trade fixtures, personal property or any other item or element which, under the applicable provisions of the Lease, will not become Landlord’s property and remain with the Building upon expiration or termination of the Lease (provided, however, that the Tenant Improvement Allowance may be used for Costs of Improvement associated with clean rooms that are portable or removable in nature [i.e., may be installed and removed without any material adverse impact on the existing improvements and Building systems in the Building], but any such portable or removable clean rooms for which any portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance is used shall be required to become Landlord’s property and remain with the Building upon expiration or termination of the Lease), and (ii) any portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance which has not been claimed or drawn by Tenant as of the later to occur of (A) January 1, 2012 or (B) the date which is five (5) years after the Rent Commencement Date shall expire and shall no longer be available to Tenant thereafter. The Tenant Improvement Allowance is provided as part of the basic consideration to Tenant under the Lease and will not result in any rental adjustment or additional rent beyond the rental amounts expressly provided in Section 3.1 of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p581">(b) Landlord acknowledges that Landlord’s prompt disbursement of the Tenant Improvement Allowance will be critical to achieve the timely completion of the Tenant Improvements and that Tenant would not execute the Lease but for Landlord’s commitment to fund the Tenant Improvement Allowance in accordance with the provisions of the Lease and of this Workletter. If, therefore, Landlord fails to make any timely disbursement of the Tenant Improvement Allowance when required to do so, and such failure continues for more than five (5) business days after Tenant gives written notice to Landlord specifying such failure and demanding funding of the applicable payment(s) by Landlord, then Tenant shall have the right (in addition to any and all other rights or remedies available to Tenant under the Lease, this Workletter and applicable law) to pay out of Tenant’s own funds any undisbursed amounts for which payment should have been made from the Tenant Improvement Allowance, in which event (i) Tenant shall thereafter be entitled to reimbursement from Landlord, within thirty (30) days after written notice from Tenant to Landlord that such payment has been made by Tenant, for the amount of all such payments by Tenant that should have been funded from the Tenant Improvement Allowance, together with interest on such disbursements by Tenant at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of disbursement to the date of reimbursement by Landlord, and (ii) to the extent any such reimbursement owed by Landlord to Tenant pursuant to the foregoing provisions remains unpaid more than thirty (30) days after Tenant’s written notice to Landlord pursuant to clause (i) above, Tenant shall be entitled to deduct the aggregate unpaid</p>
          <p id="s1p582">B – 5</p>
          <p id="s1p583">reimbursement amount, together with interest thereon as provided in clause (i) above, from payments of minimum rental, Operating Expenses and other amounts thereafter becoming due from Tenant under the Lease and this Workletter.</p>
          <p id="s1p584">4. Tenant’s Work. Tenant shall construct and install the Tenant Improvements in the Premises substantially in accordance with the Approved Plans. Tenant’s construction of the Tenant Improvements shall be performed in accordance with, and shall in all respects be subject to, the terms and conditions of the Lease (to the extent not inconsistent with this Workletter), and shall also be subject to the following conditions:</p>
          <p id="s1p585">(a) Contractor Requirements. The general contractor engaged by Tenant for construction of the Tenant Improvements, and any subcontractors, shall be duly licensed in California and shall be subject to Landlord’s prior written approval (in accordance with and to the extent provided in Paragraph l(e) above). Tenant shall engage only union contractors for the construction of the Tenant Improvements and for the installation of Tenant’s fixtures and equipment in the Building, and shall require all such contractors engaged by Tenant, and all of their subcontractors, to use only union labor on or in connection with such work, except to the extent Landlord determines, in its reasonable discretion, that the use of non-union labor would not create a material risk of labor disputes, picketing or work interruptions at the Center, in which event Landlord shall, to that extent, waive such union labor requirement at Tenant’s request.</p>
          <p id="s1p586">(b) Costs and Expenses of Tenant Improvements. Subject to Landlord’s payment or reimbursement obligations under Paragraph 3 hereof with respect to Landlord’s share of the Cost of Improvements for the Tenant Improvements, Tenant shall promptly pay all costs and expenses arising out of the design and construction of the Tenant Improvements (including the costs of permits) and shall furnish Landlord with evidence of payment on request. Tenant shall provide Landlord with ten (10) days prior written notice before commencing any construction activities on the Property. Upon completion of construction of the Tenant Improvements, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a release and unconditional lien waiver executed by each contractor, subcontractor and materialman involved in the design or construction of the Tenant Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p587">(c) Tenant’s Indemnification. Tenant shall indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord) and hold Landlord harmless from all suits, claims, actions, losses, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, claims for workers’ compensation, attorneys’ fees and costs) based on personal injury or property damage or contract claims (including, but not limited to, claims for breach of warranty) arising from the design and construction of the Tenant Improvements from any cause whatsoever, except to the extent any such claims or other matters arise from negligence or willful misconduct or omission by Landlord or its agents, employees or contractors. Tenant shall repair or replace (or, at Landlord’s election, reimburse Landlord for the cost of repairing or replacing) any portion of the buildings or other existing improvements on the Property and/or any of Landlord’s real or personal property or equipment that is damaged, lost or destroyed in the course of or in connection with the construction of the Tenant Improvements, except to the extent (i) any such damage, loss or destruction is caused by negligence or willful misconduct or omission by</p>
          <p id="s1p588">B – 6</p>
          <p id="s1p589">Landlord or its agents, employees or contractors, or (ii) any demolition or removal of existing improvements is explicitly contemplated in the Approved Plans as approved by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p590">(d) Insurance. With respect to the construction of the Tenant Improvements, Tenant’s contractors shall obtain and provide to Landlord certificates evidencing workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, public liability and property damage insurance in amounts and forms and with companies reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, and Tenant shall provide to Landlord certificates evidencing Tenant’s compliance with the insurance requirements of Article 10 of the Lease (except to the extent any such requirements by their nature or terms are clearly relevant only after Tenant’s commencement of business operations on the Premises). In addition, to the extent Landlord or Project Manager advises Tenant of any specific insurance requirements that are commercially reasonable and customary during a “course of construction” period (such as, but not limited to, designation of specified “additional insureds” who would not ordinarily be required to be named in that capacity during the Lease term under Article 10 of the Lease), Tenant shall comply with and/or cause its contractors (as applicable) to comply with such additional requirements.</p>
          <p id="s1p591">(e) Rules and Regulations. Tenant and Tenant’s contractors shall comply with any rules, regulations and requirements that Landlord, Project Manager or Landlord’s property manager or general contractor (if any) may reasonably impose with respect to the construction of the Tenant Improvements. Tenant’s agreement with Tenant’s contractors shall require each contractor to provide reasonable and customary daily cleanup of the construction area to the extent that such cleanup is necessitated by the performance of such contractor’s activities in connection with the construction of the Tenant Improvements.</p>
          <p id="s1p592">(f) Risk of Loss. All materials, work, installations and decorations of any nature brought onto or installed in the Building, by or at the direction of Tenant or in connection with the construction of the Tenant Improvements, prior to the Rent Commencement Date shall be at Tenant’s risk, and neither Landlord nor any party acting on Landlord’s behalf shall be responsible for any damage, loss or destruction thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p593">(g) Condition of Tenant’s Work. All work performed by Tenant shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, shall be free from defects in design, materials and workmanship, and shall be completed in compliance with the Approved Plans in all material respects and in compliance with all applicable governmental laws, ordinances, codes and regulations in force at the time such work is completed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant shall be responsible (i) for obtaining all permits and approvals necessary for the construction of the Tenant Improvements, and (ii) for compliance of all Tenant Improvements with the requirements of the ADA and all similar or related requirements under federal, state or local laws pertaining to access by persons with disabilities.</p>
          <p id="s1p594">(h) Phases. Tenant may construct the Tenant Improvements in phases, at Tenant’s discretion, subject to the limitations set forth above with respect to the period of time within which the Tenant Improvement Allowance is available for use.</p>
          <p id="s1p595">5. No Agency. Nothing contained in this Workletter shall make or constitute Tenant as the agent of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p596">B – 7</p>
          <p id="s1p597">6. Survival. Without limiting any survival provisions which would otherwise be implied or construed under applicable law, the provisions of Paragraph 4(c) of this Workletter shall survive the termination of the Lease with respect to matters occurring prior to expiration of the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p598">7. Miscellaneous. All references in this Workletter to a number of days shall be construed to refer to calendar days, unless otherwise specified herein. If any item requiring approval by Landlord is disapproved by Landlord in a timely manner, the procedure for preparation and approval of that item shall be repeated.</p>
          <p id="s1p599">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Workletter concurrently with and as of the date of the Lease.</p>
