Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete Landlord’s Work (as defined below) within one hundred twenty (120) days after building permits are obtained for the improvements to be made to the Premises in accordance with this Lease.

          <p id="s1p73">but the Term Commencement Date and the Term Expiration Date shall be extended accordingly; provided, however, that the Term Commencement Date and the Term Expiration Date shall not be extended to the extent that any delay in achieving Substantial Completion of Landlord’s Work is caused by (a) the failure of Tenant or Tenant’s architect to timely deliver any item in the Work Letter, (b) the actions or omissions of Tenant or its employees, agents, contractors or architects, or (c) a default by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease (each, a “Tenant Delay”). Landlord’s Work shall be deemed “Substantially Complete” if Landlord has completed all of Landlord’s Work, subject only to a punchlist of items that do not materially and substantially interfere with Tenant’s construction of the Tenant Improvements (as defined below). Tenant shall deliver to Landlord promptly after Tenant’s receipt thereof (y) a certificate of occupancy for the Premises suitable for the Permitted Use and (z) a Certificate of Substantial Completion in the form of the American Institute of Architects document G704, executed by the project architect and the general contractor. “Landlord’s Work” means (a) installation of a sliding or roll-up glass door (the “Door”) to be used for shipping and receiving purposes in accordance with plans and specifications provided by Tenant, subject to Landlord’s approval, (b) installation of demising walls to separate the Premises from the balance of the Building, (c) installation of separate meters or submeters for water and electricity provided to the Premises (provided that (i) Tenant shall have dedicated space in an electrical room in the Premises for any such meter or submeter, (ii) Landlord shall be responsible for reading any such meters and submeters and quantifying Tenant’s use of such utilities for purposes of Tenant’s reimbursement of the cost of such utilities to Landlord and (iii) Tenant shall provide to Landlord reasonable access to such meters and submeters for the purpose of Landlord’s reading thereof), (d) installation of direct digital controls to measure air flow to the Premises from the HVAC system and (e) any work required to cause the Building heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, plumbing system and electrical system (collectively, the “Relevant Systems”) to be in good working order and repair as of the Term Commencement Date. In the event that the Relevant Systems are not in good working order and repair as of the Term Commencement Date, Landlord shall make any repairs and material capital replacements to such Relevant Systems at Landlord’s sole cost and expense; provided that such obligation shall not extend to customary maintenance or capital improvements. Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to order the Door once Landlord and Tenant have approved the specifications therefor. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease or the Work Letter to the contrary, in the event that, despite such efforts by Landlord, the timing of delivery of the Door prevents Landlord from timely completing Landlord’s Work, Tenant shall not be entitled to any remedies for such delay, including, without limitation, abatement of Rent, and Landlord shall, on or before the Term Commencement Date, install a temporary alternative to the Door that is reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p74">4.2. The “ Term Commencement Date” shall be the later of (i) November 1, 2006 or (ii) the date on which Landlord’s Work is Substantially Complete (or the date on which Landlord’s Work would have been Substantially Complete absent Tenant Delay or Force Majeure (as defined below)); provided, however, that if the Term Commencement Date is not the first day of a calendar month, then the first lease year shall be extended through the last day of the calendar month in which the first 12-month period expires, and Rent for the additional period at the end of the first lease year shall be payable at the rate for the 12th month of the Term. “Force Majeure” means accident; breakage; repair; governmental regulation, moratorium or other governmental action.

          <p id="s1p75">4</p>
          <p id="s1p76">day is not the last day of a calendar month, then the Term Expiration Date shall be the last date of the calendar month in which such preceding day occurs. Landlord and Tenant shall each execute and deliver to the other written acknowledgment of the actual Term Commencement Date and the Term Expiration Date when such are established, and shall attach it to this Lease as Exhibit B. Failure to execute and deliver such acknowledgment, however, shall not affect the Term Commencement Date or Landlord’s or Tenant’s liability hereunder. Failure by Tenant to obtain validation by any medical review board or other similar governmental licensing of the Premises required for the Permitted Use by Tenant shall not serve to extend the Term Commencement Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p77">4.3. Prior to entering upon the Premises, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord evidence satisfactory to Landlord that insurance coverages required of Tenant under the provisions of Section 21 are in effect, and such entry shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this Lease other than the payment of Basic Annual Rent or Additional Rent (as defined below).</p>

If the total cost of the Tenant Improvements exceeds Seventy-Five Dollars ($75) per square foot of Rentable Area of the Premises, then the overage shall be paid by Tenant prior to the Term Commencement Date; provided, however that Tenant may withhold any retainage properly withheld by Tenant pursuant to its contract(s) with contractors and any other amounts to which Landlord approves in advance in writing, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay (collectively, the “Excluded Amounts”); provided, further, that Tenant shall pay the Excluded Amounts when required by such contract(s) or by Applicable Laws (as defined below). Tenant shall have until December 31, 2007, to expend the unused portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance, after which date Landlord’s obligation to fund such costs shall expire. Any unused portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance shall be credited against Tenant’s obligation to pay Rent, with such unused amount amortized over the Initial Term of this Lease and resulting in corresponding reductions in Tenant’s obligation to pay monthly installments of Basic Annual Rent. As used herein, the term “Initial Term” shall mean the period commencing on the Term Commencement Date and expiring on the Term Expiration Date.</p>
          <p id="s1p80">4.6. The selection of the architect, engineer, general contractor and major subcontractors shall be in accordance with the terms of the Work Letter.</p>

          <p id="s1p86">5.2. In addition to Basic Annual Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as additional rent (“ Additional Rent”) at times hereinafter specified in this Lease (a) Tenant’s pro rata share, as set forth in Section 2.8 (“Tenant’s Pro Rata Share”), of Operating Expenses as provided in Section 7 and (b) any other amounts that Tenant assumes or agrees to pay under the provisions of this Lease that are owed to Landlord, including, without limitation, any and all other sums that may become due by reason of any default of Tenant or failure on Tenant’s part to comply with the agreements, terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be performed by Tenant, after notice and the lapse of any applicable cure periods.</p>
          <p id="s1p87">5.3.

          <p id="s1p103">7.3. Landlord’s annual statement shall be final and binding upon Tenant unless Tenant, within ninety (90) days after Tenant’s receipt thereof, shall contest any item therein by giving written notice to Landlord, specifying each item contested and the reasons therefor. If, during such ninety (90)-day period, Tenant reasonably and in good faith questions or contests the correctness of Landlord’s statement of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses, Landlord shall provide Tenant with access to Landlord’s books and records and such information as Landlord reasonably determines to be responsive to Tenant’s questions. In the event that, after Tenant’s review of such information, Landlord and Tenant cannot agree upon the amount of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses, then Tenant shall have the right to have an independent public accounting firm hired by Tenant (at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, unless the Independent Review indicates that Landlord overstated the Operating Expenses by more than five percent (5%) of the actual Operating Expenses, in which event Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the fees and costs of the Independent Review) and approved by Landlord (which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay) audit and review such of Landlord’s books and records for the year in question (the “Independent Review”). The results of any such Independent Review shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. If the Independent Review shows that Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses actually paid for the calendar year in question exceeded Tenant’s obligations for such calendar year, then Landlord shall, at Tenant’s option, either (a) credit the excess to the next succeeding installments of estimated Additional Rent or (b) pay the excess to Tenant within thirty (30) days after delivery of such results. If the Independent Review shows that Tenant’s payments of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses for such calendar year were less than Tenant’s obligation for the calendar year, then Tenant shall pay the deficiency to the Landlord within thirty (30) days after delivery of such results.</p>
          <p id="s1p104">7.4. Tenant shall not be responsible for Operating Expenses attributable to the time period prior to the Term Commencement Date; provided, however, that if Landlord shall permit Tenant possession of the Premises prior to the Term Commencement Date, Tenant shall be responsible for Operating Expenses from such earlier date of possession. Tenant’s responsibility for Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses shall continue to the latest of (a) the date of termination of the Lease, (b) the date Tenant has fully vacated the Premises or (c) if termination of the Lease is due to a default by Tenant, the date of rental commencement of a replacement tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p105">7.5. Operating Expenses for the calendar year in which Tenant’s obligation to share therein commences and for the calendar year in which such obligation ceases shall be prorated on a basis reasonably determined by Landlord. Expenses such as taxes, assessments and insurance premiums that are incurred for an extended time period shall be prorated based upon the time periods to which they apply so that the amounts attributed to the Premises relate in a reasonable manner to the time period wherein Tenant has an obligation to share in Operating Expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p106">9</p>
          <p id="s1p107">8. Rentable Area.</p>
          <p id="s1p108">8.1. The term “Rentable Area” as set forth in Section 2 and as may otherwise be referenced within this Lease reflects such areas as have been reasonably calculated by Landlord’s architect.</p>
          <p id="s1p109">8.2. The “Rentable Area” of the Building has generally been determined by making separate calculations of Rentable Area applicable to each floor within the Building and totaling the Rentable Area of all floors within the Building. The Rentable Area of a floor has been computed by measuring to the outside finished surface of the permanent outer Building walls. The full area calculated as previously set forth is included as Rentable Area, without deduction for columns and projections or vertical penetrations, including stairs, elevator shafts, flues, pipe shafts, vertical ducts and the like, as well as such items’ enclosing walls.</p>
          <p id="s1p110">8.3. The Rentable Area of the Project is the total Rentable Area of all buildings within the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p111">8.4. The term “Rentable Area,” when applied to the Premises, is that area equal to the usable area of the Premises, plus an equitable allocation of Rentable Area within the Building that is not then utilized or expected to be utilized as usable area, including, but not limited to, that portion of the Building devoted to corridors, equipment rooms, restrooms, elevator lobby, atrium and mailroom. In making such allocations, consideration has been given to tenants benefited by space allocated such that the area that primarily serves tenants of only one floor, such as corridors and restrooms upon such floor, has been allocated to usable area of the Building as a whole.</p>
          <p id="s1p112">8.5. The Rentable Areas set forth Section 2 have been agreed to by Landlord and Tenant and shall not be subject to adjustment, unless Tenant exercises its right to expand the Premises pursuant to Section 43 below.</p>
          <p id="s1p113">9. Security Deposit.</p>
          <p id="s1p114">9.1. No later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date (time being of the essence), Tenant shall deposit with Landlord either a letter of credit (the “ Letter of Credit”) or immediately available funds (the “Cash Deposit”) in the amount set forth in Section 2.11, which Letter of Credit or Cash Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for the faithful performance by Tenant of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease; provided, however, that if Tenant deposits with Landlord the Cash Deposit, then Landlord agrees to return the Cash Deposit to Tenant within two (2) business days after Landlord’s receipt of the Letter of Credit. Landlord shall be entitled to use the Cash Deposit in any circumstance where Landlord would be entitled to draw upon the Letter of Credit under this Lease. The Letter of Credit shall be (a) in a form reasonably acceptable to Landlord, (b) issued by a financial institution selected by Tenant and reasonably acceptable to Landlord, (c) for the benefit of Landlord, but assignable by Landlord to any subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer of the Building or the Project, (d) automatically renewable from year to year throughout the Term, (e) payable by sight draft in a location reasonably acceptable to Landlord</p>
          <p id="s1p115">10</p>
          <p id="s1p116">upon presentation of a certification signed by an officer of Landlord stating that a Default under this Lease has occurred and has not been cured within any applicable cure period and (f) payable in the event such Letter of Credit is not renewed on or before the date that is thirty (30) days prior to its expiration. If there is a Default by Tenant with respect to any provision of this Lease, including, but not limited to, any provision relating to the payment of Rent, then Landlord may (but shall not be required to) draw upon the Letter of Credit and use, apply or retain any amount drawn for the payment of any Rent or any other sum in default, or to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage that Landlord may suffer by reason of Tenant’s Default. If the Letter of Credit is so drawn, then Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after such draw, replace the Letter of Credit with a new letter of credit conforming to the requirements of this Section 9.1, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. Tenant’s failure to do so shall be a material breach of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p117">9.2. In the event of bankruptcy or other debtor-creditor proceedings against Tenant, the Security Deposit shall be deemed to be applied first to the payment of Rent and other charges due Landlord for all periods prior to the filing of such proceedings.</p>
          <p id="s1p118">9.3. Landlord may deliver to any purchaser of Landlord’s interest in the Premises the funds deposited hereunder by Tenant, and thereupon Landlord shall be discharged from any further liability with respect to such deposit. This provision shall also apply to any subsequent transfers.</p>
          <p id="s1p119">9.4. If no Default or Imminent Default (as defined below) by Tenant has occurred on or before the date that is three (3) years after the Term Commencement Date, then Tenant may reduce the amount of the Letter of Credit to Ninety-Eight Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-Three Dollars ($98,973), at no cost to Landlord; provided, however, that if Landlord does not allow the Letter of Credit to be so reduced as the result of an Imminent Default by Tenant, then Landlord agrees to notify Tenant of such Imminent Default and if Tenant cures such Imminent Default within the cure period provided in Section 24.4 below, if any, then immediately upon completion of such cure Tenant may reduce the amount of the Letter of Credit to Ninety-Eight Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-Three Dollars ($98,973), at no cost to Landlord. If there is no uncured Default or Imminent Default by Tenant as of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, then the Letter of Credit shall be returned to Tenant (or, at Landlord’s option, to the last assignee of Tenant’s interest hereunder) within thirty (30) days after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease; provided, however, that if Landlord does not so return the Letter of Credit as the result of an Imminent Default by Tenant, then Landlord agrees to notify Tenant of such Imminent Default and, if Tenant cures such Imminent Default within the cure period provided in Section 24.4 below, if any, then Landlord shall return the Letter of Credit to Tenant (or, at Landlord’s option, to the last assignee of Tenant’s interest hereunder) within thirty (30) days after the completion of such cure. As used in this Lease, the term “Imminent Default” shall mean the occurrence of an event that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would constitute a Default.</p>
          <p id="s1p120">10. Use.</p>
          <p id="s1p121">10.1. Tenant shall use the Premises for the purpose set forth in Section 2.12, and shall not use the Premises, or permit or suffer the Premises to be used, for any other purpose without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p122">11</p>
          <p id="s1p123">10.2. Tenant shall not use or occupy the Premises in violation of Applicable Laws; zoning ordinances; or the certificate of occupancy issued for the Building, and shall, upon five (5) days’ written notice from Landlord, discontinue any use of the Premises that is declared or claimed by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be a violation of any of the above, or that in Landlord’s reasonable opinion violates any of the above. Tenant shall comply with any direction of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction that shall, by reason of the nature of Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, impose any duty upon Tenant or Landlord with respect to the Premises or with respect to the use or occupation thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p124">10.3. Tenant shall not do or permit to be done anything that will invalidate or increase the cost of any fire, environmental, extended coverage or any other insurance policy covering the Building and the Project, and shall comply with all rules, orders, regulations and requirements of the insurers of the Building and the Project, and Tenant shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for any additional premium charged for such policy by reason of Tenant’s failure to comply with the provisions of this Section.</p>
          <p id="s1p125">10.4. Tenant shall keep all doors opening onto public corridors closed, except when in use for ingress and egress.</p>
          <p id="s1p126">10.5. No additional locks or bolts of any kind shall be placed upon any of the doors or windows by Tenant, nor shall any changes be made to existing locks or the mechanisms thereof without Landlord’s prior written consent. Tenant shall, upon termination of this Lease, return to Landlord all keys to offices and restrooms either furnished to or otherwise procured by Tenant. In the event any key so furnished to Tenant is lost, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the cost of replacing the same or of changing the lock or locks opened by such lost key if Landlord shall deem it necessary to make such change.</p>
          <p id="s1p127">10.6. No awnings or other projections shall be attached to any outside wall of the Building. No curtains, blinds, shades or screens shall be attached to or hung in, or used in connection with, any window or door of the Premises other than Landlord’s standard window coverings. Neither the interior nor exterior of any windows shall be coated or otherwise sunscreened without Landlord’s prior written consent, nor shall any bottles, parcels or other articles be placed on the windowsills. No equipment, furniture or other items of personal property shall be placed on any exterior balcony without Landlord’s prior written consent.</p>
          <p id="s1p128">10.7. No sign, advertisement or notice shall be exhibited, painted or affixed by Tenant on any part of the Premises or the Building without Landlord’s prior written consent; provided that Tenant shall have the right to install a sign with its name and corporate logo on the exterior of the Building, the size, appearance and characteristics of which shall be subject to Landlord’s prior written consent. Interior signs on doors and the directory tablet shall be inscribed, painted or affixed for Tenant by Landlord at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, and shall be of a size, color and type acceptable to Landlord. The directory tablet shall be provided exclusively for the display of the name and location of tenants only. Tenant shall not place anything on the exterior of the corridor walls or corridor doors other than Landlord’s standard lettering.</p>
          <p id="s1p129">12</p>
          <p id="s1p130">10.8. Tenant shall cause any office equipment or machinery to be installed in the Premises so as to reasonably prevent sounds or vibrations therefrom from extending into the Common Areas or other offices in the Building. Further, Tenant shall not place any equipment weighing five hundred (500) pounds or greater within the Premises without Landlord’s prior written approval, and such equipment shall be placed in a location designed to carry the weight of such equipment.</p>
          <p id="s1p131">10.9. Tenant shall not (a) do or permit anything to be done in or about the Premises that shall in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other tenants or occupants of the Building or the Project, or injure or unreasonably annoy them, or (b) use or allow the Premises to be used for immoral or unlawful purposes, nor shall Tenant knowingly cause, maintain or permit any nuisance or waste in, on or about the Premises, the Building or the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p132">10.10. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, Tenant shall be responsible for all liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with the compliance of the Premises with the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. (together with regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the “ ADA”), and Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord from and against any loss, cost, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) arising out of any failure of such improvements to comply with the ADA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall be responsible for all liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with the compliance of the existing structural portions and tenant improvements of the Premises as of the date of this Lease, the “path of travel” into and within the Building (but not within the Premises, except as specifically described in this sentence) and the Project’s parking lots, walkways and landscaping areas with the ADA, and Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tenant from and against any loss, cost, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) arising out of any failure of Landlord to make such aspects of the Project comply with the ADA. The provisions of this Section 10.10 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p133">11. Brokers.</p>
          <p id="s1p134">11.1. Tenant represents and warrants that it has had no dealings with any real estate broker or agent in connection with the negotiation of this Lease, other than CRESA Partners (“ Broker”), and that it knows of no other real estate broker or agent that is or might be entitled to a commission in connection with this Lease. Landlord shall compensate Broker in relation to this Lease pursuant to a separate agreement between Landlord and Broker.</p>
          <p id="s1p135">11.2. Tenant represents and warrants that no broker or agent has made any representation or warranty relied upon by Tenant in Tenant’s decision to enter into this Lease, other than as contained in this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p136">11.3. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the employment of brokers by Landlord is for the purpose of solicitation of offers of leases from prospective tenants and that no authority is granted to any broker to furnish any representation (written or oral) or warranty from Landlord unless expressly contained within this Lease. Landlord is executing this Lease in reliance upon Tenant’s representations and warranties contained within Sections 11.1 and 11.2.</p>
          <p id="s1p137">13</p>
          <p id="s1p138">12. Holding Over.</p>
          <p id="s1p139">12.1. If, with Landlord’s prior written consent, Tenant holds possession of all or any part of the Premises after the Term, Tenant shall become a tenant from month to month after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, and in such case Tenant shall continue to pay (a) the Basic Annual Rent in accordance with Section 5, and (b) Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses. Any such month-to-month tenancy shall be subject to every other term, covenant and agreement contained herein.</p>
          <p id="s1p140">12.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term without Landlord’s prior written consent, Tenant shall become a tenant at sufferance subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease, except that the monthly rent shall be equal to (i) for the first two months of holdover, one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Rent in effect during the last thirty (30) days of the Term, and (ii) thereafter, one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Rent in effect during the last thirty (30) days of the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p141">12.3. Acceptance by Landlord of Rent after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term shall not result in an extension, renewal or reinstatement of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p142">12.4. The foregoing provisions of this Section 12 are in addition to and do not affect Landlord’s right of reentry or any other rights of Landlord hereunder or as otherwise provided by Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p143">13. Taxes on Tenant’s Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p144">13.1. Tenant shall pay prior to delinquency any and all taxes levied against any personal property or trade fixtures placed by Tenant in or about the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p145">13.2. If any such taxes on Tenant’s personal property or trade fixtures are levied against Landlord or Landlord’s property or, if the assessed valuation of the Building or the Property is increased by inclusion therein of a value attributable to Tenant’s personal property or trade fixtures, and if Landlord, after written notice to Tenant, pays the taxes based upon any such increase in the assessed valued of the Building or the Project, then Tenant shall, upon demand, repay to Landlord the taxes so paid by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p146">13.3. If any improvements in or alterations to the Premises, whether owned by Landlord or Tenant and whether or not affixed to the real property so as to become a part thereof, are assessed for real property tax purposes at a valuation higher than the valuation at which improvements conforming to Landlord’s building standards (the “ Building Standard”) in other spaces in the Building are assessed, then the real property taxes and assessments levied against Landlord or the Building by reason of such excess assessed valuation shall be deemed to be taxes levied against personal property of Tenant and shall be governed by the provisions of Section 13.2 above. Any such excess assessed valuation due to improvements in or alterations to space in the Building leased by other tenants of Landlord shall not be included in the Operating Expenses defined in Section 7, but shall be treated, as to such other tenants, as provided in this Section 13.3. If the records of the County Assessor are available and sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for determining whether said Tenant improvements or alterations are assessed at a higher valuation than the Building Standard, then such records shall be binding on both Landlord and Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p147">14</p>
          <p id="s1p148">14. Condition of Premises. Tenant acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any agent of Landlord has made any representation or warranty with respect to the condition of the Premises, the Building or the Project, or with respect to the suitability of the Premises, the Building or the Project for the conduct of Tenant’s business, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.1 above. Tenant’s taking of possession of the Premises shall, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Landlord and Tenant, conclusively establish that the Premises, the Building and the Project were at such time in good, sanitary and satisfactory condition and repair.</p>
          <p id="s1p149">15. Common Areas and Parking Facilities.</p>
          <p id="s1p150">15.1. Tenant shall have the non-exclusive right, in common with others, to use the Common Areas, subject to the rules and regulations adopted by Landlord and attached hereto as Exhibit D, together with such other reasonable and nondiscriminatory rules and regulations as are hereafter promulgated by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion (the “Rules and Regulations”). Tenant shall faithfully observe and comply with the Rules and Regulations. Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant for the violation or non-performance by any other tenant or any agent, employee or invitee thereof of any of the Rules and Regulations.</p>
          <p id="s1p151">15.2. Tenant shall have a non-exclusive license to use parking facilities serving the Building in common on an unreserved basis with other tenants of the Building and the Project at no additional cost to Tenant, at a ratio of three and three tenths (3.3) parking spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet of Rentable Area of the Premises, which amounts to 152 parking spaces as of the Term Commencement Date, which number shall include eight (8) reserved parking spaces (the “Reserved Spaces”) for Tenant’s exclusive use on the side of the Building that faces Guadalupe Canyon Parkway (provided that (a) Tenant shall only have the right to have the Reserved Spaces on an exclusive basis for so long as Tenant provides services at the Premises to patients with heart conditions, (b) Tenant shall have the right to install signage marking the Reserved Spaces, subject to Landlord’s prior written approval, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay, (c) Tenant shall maintain any such signage at its sole cost and expense and (d) Tenant shall remove any such signage at its sole cost and expense and repair any damage caused by such removal if Tenant is no longer entitled to exclusive use of the Reserved Spaces pursuant to the terms of this Section 15.2).</p>
          <p id="s1p152">15.3. Subject to Tenant’s rights under Section 15.2 above, Tenant agrees to comply with all reasonable rules and regulations adopted by Landlord with respect to the use of the parking facilities. Nothing in this Section, however, is intended to create an affirmative duty on Landlord’s part to monitor parking.</p>
          <p id="s1p153">15.4. Landlord reserves the right to modify the Common Areas, including the right to add or remove exterior and interior landscaping and to subdivide real property, provided that no such modifications may have a material adverse impact on Tenant’s access to or use and enjoyment of the Premises. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord specifically reserves the right to allow the exclusive use of corridors and restroom facilities located on specific floors to one or more tenants occupying such floors; provided, however, that Tenant shall not be deprived of the use of the corridors reasonably required to serve the Premises or of restroom facilities serving the floor upon which the Premises are located.</p>

          <p id="s1p155">16. Utilities and Services.</p>
          <p id="s1p156">16.1. Tenant shall pay for all water (including the cost to service, repair and replace reverse osmosis, de-ionized and other treated water), gas, heat, light, power, telephone and other utilities supplied to the Premises, together with any fees, surcharges and taxes thereon. If any such utility is not separately metered to Tenant, Tenant shall pay a reasonable proportion (to be determined by Landlord) of all charges of such utility jointly metered with other premises as part of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses or, in the alternative, Landlord may, at its option, monitor the usage of such utilities by Tenant and charge Tenant with the cost of purchasing, installing and monitoring such metering equipment, which cost shall be paid by Tenant as Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p157">16.2. Landlord shall not be liable for, nor shall any eviction of Tenant result from the failure to furnish any such utility or service due to Force Majeure. In the event of such failure, Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement or reduction of Rent, nor shall Tenant be relieved from the operation of any covenant or agreement of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p158">16.3. Tenant shall pay for, prior to delinquency of payment therefor, any utilities and services that may be furnished to the Premises during or, if Tenant occupies the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, after the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p159">16.4. Tenant shall not, without Landlord’s prior written consent, use any device in the Premises (including, without limitation, data processing machines) that will in any way (a) increase the amount of ventilation, air exchange, gas, steam, electricity or water beyond the existing capacity of the Building as proportionately allocated to the Premises based upon Tenant’s Pro Rata Share as usually furnished or supplied for the use set forth in Section 2.12 or (b) exceed Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building’s capacity to provide such utilities or services.</p>
          <p id="s1p160">16.5. If Tenant shall require utilities or services in excess of those usually furnished or supplied for tenants in similar spaces in the Building by reason of Tenant’s equipment or extended hours of business operations, then Tenant shall first procure Landlord’s consent of Landlord for the use thereof, which consent Landlord may condition upon the availability of such excess utilities or services, and Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent an amount equal to the cost of providing such excess utilities and services.</p>
          <p id="s1p161">16.6. Utilities and services provided by Landlord to the Premises shall be paid by Tenant directly to the supplier of such utility or service.</p>
          <p id="s1p162">16.7. Landlord shall provide water in Common Areas for drinking and lavatory purposes only; provided, however, that if Landlord determines that Tenant requires, uses or consumes water for any purpose other than ordinary drinking and lavatory purposes, Landlord may install a water meter and thereby measure Tenant’s water consumption for all purposes. Tenant shall pay Landlord for the costs of such meter and the installation thereof and, throughout the duration of Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises, Tenant shall keep said meter and installation equipment in good working order and repair at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. If Tenant fails to</p>
          <p id="s1p163">16</p>
          <p id="s1p164">so maintain such meter and equipment, Landlord may repair or replace the same and shall collect the costs therefor from Tenant. Tenant agrees to pay for water consumed, as shown on said meter, as and when bills are rendered. If Tenant fails to timely make such payments, Landlord may pay such charges and collect the same from Tenant. Any such costs or expenses incurred, or payments made by Landlord for any of the reasons or purposes hereinabove stated, shall be deemed to be Additional Rent payment by Tenant and collectible by Landlord as such.</p>
          <p id="s1p165">16.8. Landlord reserves the right to stop service of the elevator, plumbing, ventilation, air conditioning and electric systems, when Landlord deems necessary or desirable, due to accident, emergency or the need to make repairs, alterations or improvements, until such repairs, alterations or improvements shall have been completed, and Landlord shall further have no responsibility or liability for failure to supply elevator facilities, plumbing, ventilation, air conditioning or electric service when prevented from doing so by Force Majeure or a failure by a third party to deliver gas, oil or another suitable fuel supply, or Landlord’s inability by exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain gas, oil or another suitable fuel. Without limiting the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that any covenants on Landlord’s part to furnish any service pursuant to any of the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions or agreements of this Lease, or to perform any act or thing for the benefit of Tenant, shall not be deemed breached if Landlord is unable to furnish or perform the same by virtue of Force Majeure.</p>
          <p id="s1p166">16.9. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 16.2 or 16.8 to the contrary, in the event that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or any portion thereof, for more than one (1) business day as a result of an interruption of, or failure to provide, any utilities or services as described in Sections 16.2 and 16.4 (“ Interruption of Service”) caused by the grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful acts or omissions of Landlord or any agent, contractor or employee of Landlord, the Basic Annual Rent and Additional Rent shall be abated proportionately with the degree to which Tenant’s use of the Premises is impaired commencing from the day immediately following such one (1) business day period and continuing until the Interruption of Service has been remedied.</p>
          <p id="s1p167">17. Alterations.</p>
          <p id="s1p168">17.1. Tenant shall make no alterations, additions or improvements in or to the Premises without Landlord’s prior written approval, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold; provided, however, that in the event any proposed alteration, addition or improvement affects (a) any structural portions of the Building, including exterior walls, roof, foundation or core of the Building, (b) the exterior of the Building or (iii) any Building systems, including elevator, plumbing, air conditioning, heating, electrical, security, life safety and power, then Landlord may withhold its approval with respect thereto in its sole and absolute discretion. Tenant shall, in making any such alterations, additions or improvements, use only those architects, contractors, suppliers and mechanics of which Landlord has given prior written approval, which approval shall be in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion. In seeking Landlord’s approval, Tenant shall provide Landlord, at least fourteen (14) days in advance of any proposed construction, with plans, specifications, bid proposals, work contracts, requests for laydown areas and such other information concerning the nature and cost of the alterations as Landlord may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may, without Landlord’s consent but upon prior written notice to Landlord, make non-structural alterations and improvements to the interior of the Premises that do not affect the Building systems, provided that the cost does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) per each such alteration or improvement.</p>

          <p id="s1p170">17.2. Tenant shall not construct or permit to be constructed partitions or other obstructions that might interfere with free access to mechanical installation or service facilities of the Building, or interfere with the moving of Landlord’s equipment to or from the enclosures containing such installations or facilities.</p>
          <p id="s1p171">17.3. Tenant shall accomplish any work performed on the Premises or the Building in such a manner as to permit any fire sprinkler system and fire water supply lines to remain fully operable at all times.</p>
          <p id="s1p172">17.4. Any work performed on the Premises or the Building by Tenant or Tenant’s contractors shall be done at such times and in such manner as Landlord may from time to time reasonably designate. Tenant covenants and agrees that all work done by Tenant or Tenant’s contractors shall be performed in full compliance with Applicable Laws. Tenant shall provide Landlord with complete “as-built” drawing print sets and electronic CADD files on disc showing any changes in the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p173">17.5. Before commencing any work, Tenant shall give Landlord at least fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice of the proposed commencement of such work.</p>
          <p id="s1p174">17.6.

          <p id="s1p175">17.7. Tenant shall repair any damage to the Premises caused by Tenant’s removal of any property from the Premises. During any such restoration period, Tenant shall pay Rent to Landlord as provided herein as if said space were otherwise occupied by Tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p176">17.8. Tenant shall remove all of its personal property and trade fixtures (excluding any items paid for with the Tenant Improvement Allowance) from the Premises prior to the expiration of this Lease or promptly after the earlier termination of this Lease. If Tenant shall fail to remove any of such personal property or trade fixtures from the Premises prior to termination of this Lease (or, in the event of a termination pursuant to Section 22 or Section 23 hereof, within three (3) months following such termination), then Landlord may, at its option, remove the same in any manner that Landlord shall choose and store said property without liability to Tenant for loss thereof or damage thereto, and Tenant shall pay Landlord, upon demand, any costs and expenses incurred due to such removal and storage or Landlord may, at its sole option and without notice to Tenant, sell such property or any portion thereof at private</p>
          <p id="s1p177">18</p>
          <p id="s1p178">sale and without legal process for such price as Landlord may obtain and apply the proceeds of such sale against any (a) amounts due by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease and (b) any expenses incident to the removal, storage and sale of said personal property. In the event of a termination of this Lease pursuant to Section 22 or Section 23 hereof, if Tenant has any personal property or trade fixtures (excluding any items paid for with the Tenant Improvement Allowance) in the Premises more than thirty (30) days after such termination, then commencing on the thirty-first (31st) day after such termination, Tenant shall pay a pro rata share of the Basic Annual Rent for that portion of the Premises containing such personal property or trade fixtures, which Basic Annual Rent shall be prorated for any partial months. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 17 to the contrary, in no event shall Tenant remove any improvement from the Premises as to which Landlord contributed payment, including, without limitation, the Tenant Improvements made pursuant to the Work Letter, without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p179">17.9. Tenant shall pay to Landlord One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) plus Landlord’s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses to cover Landlord’s overhead and expenses for plan review, coordination, scheduling and supervision of all changes installed by Tenant or its contractors or agents, other than the initial Tenant Improvements. For purposes of payment of such sum, Tenant shall submit to Landlord copies of all bills, invoices and statements covering the costs of such charges, accompanied by payment to Landlord of the fee set forth in this Section. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any extra expenses incurred by Landlord by reason of faulty work done by Tenant or its contractors, or by reason of delays caused by such work, or by reason of inadequate clean-up.</p>
          <p id="s1p180">17.10. Within sixty (60) days after final completion of the Tenant Improvements (or any other alterations, improvement or additions performed by Tenant with respect to the Premises), Tenant shall submit to Landlord documentation showing the amounts expended by Tenant (other than funds that constitute the Tenant Improvement Allowance or Additional TI Allowance) with respect to such Tenant Improvements (or any other alterations, improvement or additions performed by Tenant with respect to the Premises), together with supporting documentation reasonably acceptable to Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p181">18. Repairs and Maintenance.</p>
          <p id="s1p182">18.1. Landlord shall repair and maintain the structural and exterior portions and Common Areas of the Building and the Project, including, without limitation, roofing and covering materials, foundations, exterior walls, plumbing, fire sprinkler systems (if any), heating, ventilating, air conditioning, elevators, and electrical systems installed or furnished by Landlord. Any costs related to the repair or maintenance activities specified in this Section 18.1 shall be included as a part of Operating Expenses, unless such repairs or maintenance is required in whole or in part because of any negligent or wrongful act or omissions of Tenant, its agents, servants, employees or invitees, in which case Tenant shall pay to Landlord the cost of such repairs and maintenance.</p>
          <p id="s1p183">18.2. Except for services of Landlord, if any, required by Section 18.1, Tenant shall at Tenant’s sole cost and expense keep the Premises and every part thereof in good condition and repair, damage thereto from ordinary wear and tear excepted. Tenant shall, upon the expiration</p>
          <p id="s1p184">19</p>
          <p id="s1p185">or sooner termination of the Term, surrender the Premises to Landlord in as good of a condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Landlord shall have no obligation to alter, remodel, improve, repair, decorate or paint the Premises or any part thereof, other than pursuant to the terms and provisions of Section 4 hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p186">18.3. Landlord shall not be liable for any failure to make any repairs or to perform any maintenance that is an obligation of Landlord unless such failure shall persist for an unreasonable time after Tenant provides Landlord with written notice of the need of such repairs or maintenance. Tenant waives its rights under Applicable Laws now or hereafter in effect to make repairs at Landlord’s expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p187">18.4. Repairs under this Section 18 that are obligations of Landlord are subject to allocation among Tenant and other tenants as Operating Expenses, except as otherwise provided in this Section 18.</p>
          <p id="s1p188">18.5. This Section 18 relates to repairs and maintenance arising in the ordinary course of operation of the Building and the Project and any related facilities. In the event of fire, earthquake, flood, vandalism, war or similar cause of damage or destruction, Section 22 shall apply in lieu of this Section 18.</p>
          <p id="s1p189">19. Liens.</p>
          <p id="s1p190">19.1. Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, Tenant shall keep the Premises, the Building and the Project free from any liens arising out of work performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by Tenant. Tenant further covenants and agrees that any mechanic’s lien filed against the Premises, the Building or the Project for work claimed to have been done for, or materials claimed to have been furnished to, shall be discharged or bonded by Tenant within twenty (20) days after the filing thereof, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense.</p>
          <p id="s1p191">19.2. Should Tenant fail to discharge or bond against any lien of the nature described in Section 19.1, Landlord may, at Landlord’s election, pay such claim or post a bond or otherwise provide security to eliminate the lien as a claim against title, and Tenant shall immediately reimburse Landlord for the costs thereof as Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p192">19.3. In the event that Tenant leases or finances the acquisition of office equipment, furnishings or other personal property of a removable nature utilized by Tenant in the operation of Tenant’s business, Tenant warrants that any Uniform Commercial Code financing statement executed by Tenant shall, upon its face or by exhibit thereto, indicate that such financing statement is applicable only to removable personal property of Tenant located within the Premises. In no event shall the address of the Building be furnished on a financing statement without qualifying language as to applicability of the lien only to removable personal property located in an identified suite leased by Tenant. Should any holder of a financing statement executed by Tenant record or place of record a financing statement that appears to constitute a lien against any interest of Landlord or against equipment that may be located other than within an identified suite leased by Tenant, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after filing such financing statement, cause (a) a copy of the lender security agreement or other documents to which the financing statement pertains to be furnished to Landlord to facilitate Landlord’s ability to</p>
          <p id="s1p193">20</p>
          <p id="s1p194">demonstrate that the lien of such financing statement is not applicable to Landlord’s interest and (b) Tenant’s lender to amend such financing statement and any other documents of record to clarify that any liens imposed thereby are not applicable to any interest of Landlord in the Premises, the Building or the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p195">20. Indemnification and Exculpation.</p>
          <p id="s1p196">20.1. Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and save Landlord harmless from and against any and all demands, claims, liabilities, losses, costs, expenses, actions, causes of action, damages or judgments, and all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements) incurred in investigating or resisting the same (collectively, “Claims”) arising from injury or death to any person or injury to any property occurring within or about the Premises, the Building or the Property arising directly or indirectly out of Tenant’s or Tenant’s employees’, agents’ or guests’ use or occupancy of the Premises or a breach or default by Tenant in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Landlord or any employee, agent or contractor of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p197">20.2. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 20.1 to the contrary, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant assumes all risk of, damage to personal property or scientific research, including, without limitation, loss of records kept by Tenant within the Premises and damage or losses caused by fire, electrical malfunction, gas explosion or water damage of any type (including, without limitation, broken water lines, malfunctioning fire sprinkler systems, roof leaks or stoppages of lines), unless any such loss is due to Landlord’s willful disregard of written notice by Tenant of need for a repair that Landlord is responsible to make for an unreasonable period of time. Tenant further waives any claim for injury to Tenant’s business or loss of income relating to any such damage or destruction of personal property as described in this Section 20.2.</p>
          <p id="s1p198">20.3. Landlord shall not be liable for any damages arising from any act, omission or neglect of any other tenant in the Building or the Project, or of any other third party, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Landlord or any employee, agent or contractor of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p199">20.4. Tenant acknowledges that security devices and services, if any, while intended to deter crime, may not in given instances prevent theft or other criminal acts. Landlord shall not be liable for injuries or losses caused by criminal acts of third parties, and Tenant assumes the risk that any security device or service may malfunction or otherwise be circumvented by a criminal. If Tenant desires protection against such criminal acts, then Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, obtain appropriate insurance coverage.</p>
          <p id="s1p200">20.5. The provisions of this Section 20 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p201">21</p>
          <p id="s1p202">21. Insurance; Waiver of Subrogation.</p>
          <p id="s1p203">21.1. Landlord shall maintain insurance for the Building and the Project in amounts equal to full replacement cost (exclusive of the costs of excavation, foundations and footings, and without reference to depreciation taken by Landlord upon its books or tax returns) or such lesser coverage as Landlord may elect, provided that such coverage shall not be less than ninety percent (90%) of such full replacement cost or the amount of such insurance Landlord’s lender, mortgagee or beneficiary (each, a “Lender”), if any, requires Landlord to maintain, providing protection against any peril generally included within the classification “Fire and Extended Coverage,” together with insurance against sprinkler damage (if applicable), vandalism and malicious mischief. Landlord, subject to availability thereof, shall further insure, if Landlord deems it appropriate, coverage against flood, environmental hazard, earthquake, loss or failure of building equipment, rental loss during the period of repairs or rebuilding, workmen’s compensation insurance and fidelity bonds for employees employed to perform services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may, but shall not be deemed required to, provide insurance for any improvements installed by Tenant or that are in addition to the standard improvements customarily furnished by Landlord, without regard to whether or not such are made a part of or are affixed to the Building. Any costs incurred by Landlord pursuant to this Section 21.1 shall constitute a portion of Operating Expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p204">21.2. In addition, Landlord shall carry commercial general liability insurance with a single limit of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for death or bodily injury, or property damage with respect to the Project. Any costs incurred by Landlord pursuant to this Section 21.2 shall constitute a portion of Operating Expenses.</p>
          <p id="s1p205">21.3. Tenant shall, at its own cost and expense, procure and maintain in effect, beginning on the Term Commencement Date or the date of occupancy, whichever occurs first, and continuing throughout the Term (and occupancy by Tenant, if any, after termination of this Lease) commercial general liability insurance with limits of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) per occurrence for death or bodily injury and not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for property damage with respect to the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p206">21.4. The insurance required to be purchased and maintained by Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall name Landlord, BioMed Realty, L.P., BioMed Realty Trust, Inc., and their respective officers, employees, agents, general partners, members and Lenders (“ Landlord Parties”) as additional insureds. Said insurance shall be with companies having a rating of not less than policyholder rating of A- and financial category rating of at least Class VIII in “Best’s Insurance Guide.” Tenant shall obtain for Landlord from the insurance companies or cause the insurance companies to furnish certificates of coverage to Landlord. No such policy shall be subject to cancellation or reduction or diminishment except after thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Landlord from the insurer. All such policies shall be written as primary policies, not contributing with and not in excess of the coverage that Landlord may carry. Tenant’s policy may be a “blanket policy” that specifically provides that the amount of insurance shall not be prejudiced by other losses covered by the policy. Tenant shall, at least twenty (20) days prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Landlord with renewals or binders. Tenant agrees that if Tenant does not take out and maintain such insurance, Landlord may (but shall not be required to) procure said insurance on Tenant’s behalf and at its cost to be paid by Tenant as Additional Rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p207">22</p>
          <p id="s1p208">21.5. Tenant assumes the risk of damage to any fixtures, goods, inventory, merchandise, equipment and leasehold improvements, and Landlord shall not be liable for injury to Tenant’s business or any loss of income therefrom, relative to such damage, all as more particularly set forth within this Lease. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, carry (a) insurance on Tenant’s leasehold improvements providing protection against all risks of physical damage or loss and (b) such insurance as Tenant desires for Tenant’s protection with respect to personal property of Tenant or business interruption.</p>
          <p id="s1p209">21.6. In each instance where insurance is to name Landlord Parties as additional insureds, Tenant shall, upon Landlord’s written request, also designate and furnish certificates evidencing such Landlord Parties as additional insureds to (a) any Lender of Landlord holding a security interest in the Building or the Project, (b) the landlord under any lease whereunder Landlord is a tenant of the real property upon which the Building is located if the interest of Landlord is or shall become that of a tenant under a ground lease rather than that of a fee owner, and (c) any management company retained by Landlord to manage the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p210">21.7. Landlord and Tenant each hereby waive any and all rights of recovery against the other or against the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of the other on account of loss or damage occasioned by such waiving party or its property or the property of others under such waiving party’s control, in each case to the extent that such loss or damage is insured against under any fire and extended coverage insurance policy that either Landlord or Tenant may have in force at the time of such loss or damage. Such waivers shall continue so long as their respective insurers so permit. Any termination of such a waiver shall be by written notice to the other party, containing a description of the circumstances hereinafter set forth in this Section 21.7. Landlord and Tenant, upon obtaining the policies of insurance required or permitted under this Lease, shall give notice to the insurance carrier or carriers that the foregoing mutual waiver of subrogation is contained in this Lease. If such policies shall not be obtainable with such waiver or shall be so obtainable only at a premium over that chargeable without such waiver, then the party seeking such policy shall notify the other of such conditions, and the party so notified shall have ten (10) days thereafter to either (a) procure such insurance with companies reasonably satisfactory to the other party or (b) agree to pay such additional premium (in Tenant’s case, in the proportion that the area of the Premises bears to the insured area). If the parties do not accomplish either (a) or (b), then this Section 21.7 shall have no effect during such time as such policies shall not be obtainable or the party in whose favor a waiver of subrogation is desired refuses to pay the additional premium. If such policies shall at any time be unobtainable, but shall be subsequently obtainable, then neither party shall be subsequently liable for a failure to obtain such insurance until a reasonable time after notification thereof by the other party. If the release of either Landlord or Tenant, as set forth in the first sentence of this Section 21.7, shall contravene Applicable Laws, then the liability of the party in question shall be deemed not released but shall be secondary to the other party’s insurer.</p>
          <p id="s1p211">21.8. Landlord may require insurance policy limits required under this Lease to be raised to conform with requirements of Landlord’s Lender or to bring coverage limits to levels then being required of new tenants within the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p212">23</p>
          <p id="s1p213">22. Damage or Destruction.</p>
          <p id="s1p214">22.1. In the event of a partial destruction of the Building or the Project by fire or other perils covered by extended coverage insurance not exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of the full insurable value thereof, and provided that (a) the damage thereto is such that the Building or the Project may be repaired, reconstructed or restored within a period of eight (8) months from the date of the happening of such casualty and (b) Landlord shall receive insurance proceeds sufficient to cover the cost of such repairs (except for any deductible amount provided by Landlord’s policy, which deductible amount, if paid by Landlord, shall constitute an Operating Expense), Landlord shall commence and proceed diligently with the work of repair, reconstruction and restoration of the Building or the Project, as applicable, and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may not terminate this Lease pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 22.1 unless the cost of such repairs in excess of any deductible amount and any available insurance proceeds to restore the Building and other improvements on the Property exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000).</p>
          <p id="s1p215">22.2. In the event of any damage to or destruction of the Building or the Project other than as described in Section 22.1, Landlord may elect to repair, reconstruct and restore the Building or the Project, as applicable, in which case this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If Landlord elects not to repair the Building or the Project, as applicable, then this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such damage or destruction.</p>
          <p id="s1p216">22.3. Within sixty (60) days following the date of damage or destruction, Landlord shall give written notice to Tenant either (a) of its election not to repair, reconstruct or restore the Building or the Project, as applicable, or (b) of the amount of time reasonably anticipated to be required to complete the repair, reconstruction and/or restoration of the Premises and the parking facilities of the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p217">22.4. Upon any termination of this Lease under any of the provisions of this Section 22, the parties shall be released thereby without further obligation to the other from the date possession of the Premises is surrendered to the Landlord, except with regard to (a) items occurring prior to the damage or destruction and (b) provisions of this Lease that, by their express terms, survive the expiration or earlier termination hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p218">22.5. In the event of repair, reconstruction and restoration as provided in this Section 22, all Rent to be paid by Tenant under this Lease shall be abated proportionately based on the extent to which Tenant’s use of the Premises is impaired during the period of such repair, reconstruction or restoration, unless Landlord provides Tenant with other space during the period of repair that, in Tenant’s reasonable opinion, is suitable for the temporary conduct of Tenant’s business.</p>
          <p id="s1p219">22.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 22, if the time required to complete the repair, reconstruction and/or restoration of the Premises and the parking facilities of the Project exceeds eight (8) months from the date of damage or destruction, then Tenant may terminate this Lease by written notice of termination given no later than sixty (60) days after Landlord notifies Tenant as to how much time will be required to complete the repair, reconstruction and/or restoration of the Premises and the parking facilities of the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p220">22.7. If Landlord is obligated to or elects to repair, reconstruct or restore as herein provided, then Landlord shall be obligated to make such repair, reconstruction or restoration only with regard to those portions of the Premises, the Building or the Project that were originally</p>
          <p id="s1p221">24</p>
          <p id="s1p222">provided at Landlord’s expense. The repair, reconstruction or restoration of improvements not originally provided by Landlord or at Landlord’s expense shall be the obligation of Tenant. In the event Tenant has elected to upgrade certain improvements from the Building Standard, Landlord shall, upon the need for replacement due to an insured loss, provide only the Building Standard, unless Tenant again elects to upgrade such improvements and pay any incremental costs related thereto, except to the extent that excess insurance proceeds, if received, are adequate to provide such upgrades, in addition to providing for basic repair, reconstruction and restoration of the Premises, the Building and the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p223">22.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 22, Landlord shall not have any obligation whatsoever to repair, reconstruct or restore the Premises if the damage resulting from any casualty covered under this Section 22 occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the Term or any extension hereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p224">23. Eminent Domain.</p>
          <p id="s1p225">23.1. In the event the whole of the Premises, or such part thereof as shall substantially interfere with the Tenant’s use and occupancy thereof, shall be taken for any public or quasi-public purpose by any lawful power or authority by exercise of the right of appropriation, condemnation or eminent domain, or sold to prevent such taking, Tenant or Landlord may terminate this Lease effective as of the date possession is required to be surrendered to said authority.</p>
          <p id="s1p226">23.2. In the event of a partial taking of the Building or the Project, or of drives, walkways or parking areas serving the Building or the Project for any public or quasi-public purpose by any lawful power or authority by exercise of right of appropriation, condemnation, or eminent domain, or sold to prevent such taking, then, without regard to whether any portion of the Premises occupied by Tenant was so taken, (a) Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease as of such taking if such taking is, in Landlord’s sole opinion, of a material nature such as to make it uneconomical to continue use of the unappropriated portion for purposes of renting office or laboratory space and (b) Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease as of such taking if such taking has a material adverse effect on Tenant’s use and enjoyment of or access to the Premises or on Tenant’s use and enjoyment of the parking spaces allocated to Tenant under Section 15.2 above; provided that Landlord shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Tenant stating Tenant’s election to termination this Lease to remedy any such material adverse effect; provided, further, that Landlord shall not be deemed to have remedied such material adverse effect by providing parking other than on the Property or adjoining property owned by Landlord or its affiliates.</p>
          <p id="s1p227">23.3. Tenant shall be entitled to any award that is specifically awarded as compensation for (a) the taking of Tenant’s personal property that was installed at Tenant’s expense and (b) the costs of Tenant moving to a new location. Except as set forth in the previous sentence, any award for such taking shall be the property of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p228">23.4. If, upon any taking of the nature described in this Section 23, this Lease continues in effect, then Landlord shall promptly proceed to restore the Premises, the Building and the Project, as applicable, to substantially their same condition prior to such partial taking. To the extent such restoration is feasible, as determined by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion, the Rent shall be decreased by a number, the numerator of which is the rental value of the Premises prior to such taking, and the denominator of which is the value of the Premises after such taking.</p>
          <p id="s1p229">25</p>
          <p id="s1p230">24. Defaults and Remedies.</p>
          <p id="s1p231">24.1. Late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rent and other sums due shall cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which shall be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any mortgage or trust deed covering the Premises. Therefore, if any installment of Rent due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within five (5) days after the date such payment is due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum of six percent (6%) of the overdue Rent as a late charge. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord shall incur by reason of late payment by Tenant. In addition to the late charge, Rent not paid when due shall bear interest from the fifth (5th) day after the date due until paid at the lesser of (a) twelve percent (12%) per annum or (b) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first occurrence of any delinquency in Tenant’s payment of Rent in any twelve (12) month period shall give rise to a late charge and interest only if Tenant fails to cure such delinquency within three (3) business days after written notice from Landlord thereof.</p>
          <p id="s1p232">24.2. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the Rent payment herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than on account of the Rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as Rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover the balance of such Rent or pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease or in equity or at law. If a dispute shall arise as to any amount or sum of money to be paid by Tenant to Landlord hereunder, Tenant shall have the right to make payment “under protest,” such payment shall not be regarded as a voluntary payment, and there shall survive the right on the part of Tenant to institute suit for recovery of the payment paid under protest.</p>
          <p id="s1p233">24.3. If Tenant fails to pay any sum of money (other than Basic Annual Rent or Rental Adjustments) required to be paid by it hereunder, or shall fail to perform any other act on its part to be performed hereunder, Landlord may, without waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligations of Tenant, but shall not be obligated to, make such payment or perform such act; provided that such failure by Tenant continues for three (3) business days (with respect to a failure to pay money) or ten (10) business days (with respect to a failure to perform any other obligation) in each case after Landlord delivers notice to Tenant demanding performance by Tenant; or that such failure by Tenant unreasonably interfered with the use of the Building by any other tenant or with the efficient operation of the Building, or resulted or could have resulted in a violation of Applicable Laws or the cancellation of an insurance policy maintained by Landlord. Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent all sums so paid or incurred by Landlord, together with interest thereon, from the date such sums were paid or incurred, at the annual rate equal to twelve percent (12%) per annum or highest rate permitted by Applicable Laws, whichever is less.</p>
          <p id="s1p234">26</p>
          <p id="s1p235">24.4. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute a “Default” hereunder by Tenant:</p>
          <p id="s1p236">(a) The abandonment or vacation of the Premises by Tenant;</p>
          <p id="s1p237">(b) The failure by Tenant to make any payment of Rent, as and when due, where such failure shall continue for a period of three (3) business days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant;</p>
          <p id="s1p238">(c) The failure by Tenant to observe or perform any obligation or covenant contained herein (other than described in Subsections 24.4(a) and 24.4(b)) to be performed by Tenant, where such failure shall continue for a period of ten (10) business days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant; provided that, if the nature of Tenant’s default is such that it reasonably requires more than ten (10) business days to cure, Tenant shall not be deemed to be in default if Tenant shall commence such cure within said ten (10) business day period and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion; and provided, further, that such cure is completed no later than ninety (90) days from the date of Tenant’s receipt of written notice from Landlord;</p>
          <p id="s1p239">(d) Tenant makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;</p>
          <p id="s1p240">(e) A receiver, trustee or custodian is appointed to or does take title, possession or control of all or substantially all of Tenant’s assets;</p>

          <p id="s1p242">(g) Any involuntary petition if filed against Tenant under any chapter of the Code and is not dismissed within one hundred twenty (120) days;</p>
          <p id="s1p243">(h) Failure to deliver an estoppel certificate in accordance with Section 29, which failure is not remedied within five (5) business days after Landlord gives Tenant a second written request to deliver such estoppel certificate; or</p>
          <p id="s1p244">(i) Tenant’s interest in this Lease is attached, executed upon or otherwise judicially seized and such action is not released within one hundred twenty (120) days of the action.</p>
          <p id="s1p245">Notices given under this Section 24.4 shall specify the alleged default and shall demand that Tenant perform the provisions of this Lease or pay the Rent that is in arrears, as the case may be, within the applicable period of time, or quit the Premises. No such notice shall be deemed a forfeiture or a termination of this Lease unless Landlord elects otherwise in such notice.</p>
          <p id="s1p246">27</p>
          <p id="s1p247">24.5. In the event of a Default by Tenant, and at any time thereafter, with or without notice or demand and without limiting Landlord in the exercise of any right or remedy that Landlord may have, Landlord shall be entitled to terminate Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises by any lawful means, in which case this Lease shall terminate and Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord. In such event, Landlord shall have the immediate right to re-enter and remove all persons and property, and such property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost and for the account of Tenant, all without service of notice or resort to legal process and without being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage that may be occasioned thereby. In the event that Landlord shall elect to so terminate this Lease, then Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant all damages incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant’s default, including, without limitation:</p>
          <p id="s1p248">(a) The worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent that had accrued at the time of such termination; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p249">(b) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent that would have accrued during the period commencing with termination of the Lease and ending at the time of award exceeds that portion of the loss of Landlord’s rental income from the Premises that Tenant proves to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction could have been reasonably avoided; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p250">(c) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds that portion of the loss of Landlord’s rental income from the Premises that Tenant proves to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction could have been reasonably avoided; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p251">(d) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or that in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including, without limitation, the cost of restoring the Premises to the condition required under the terms of this Lease; plus</p>
          <p id="s1p252">(e) At Landlord’s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p253">As used in Subsections 24.5(a) and 24.5(b), “worth at the time of award” shall be computed by allowing interest at the rate specified in Section 24.1. As used in Subsection 24.5(c) above, the “worth at the time of the award” shall be computed by taking the present value of such amount, using the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of the award plus six (6) percentage points.</p>
          <p id="s1p254">24.6. If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as provided in Section 24.5, then Landlord may, from time to time, recover all Rent as it becomes due under this Lease. At any time thereafter, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease and to recover damages to which Landlord is entitled.</p>
          <p id="s1p255">28</p>
          <p id="s1p256">24.7. In the event Landlord elects to terminate this Lease and relet the Premises, Landlord may execute any new lease in its own name. Tenant hereunder shall have no right or authority whatsoever to collect any Rent from such tenant. The proceeds of any such reletting shall be applied as follows:</p>
          <p id="s1p257">(a) First, to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord, including, without limitation, storage charges or brokerage commissions owing from Tenant to Landlord as the result of such reletting;</p>
          <p id="s1p258">(b) Second, to the payment of the costs and expenses of reletting the Premises, including (a) alterations and repairs that Landlord deems reasonably necessary and advisable and (b) reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements incurred by Landlord in connection with the retaking of the Premises and such reletting;</p>
          <p id="s1p259">(c) Third, to the payment of Rent and other charges due and unpaid hereunder; and</p>
          <p id="s1p260">(d) Fourth, to the payment of future Rent and other damages payable by Tenant under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p261">24.8. All of Landlord’s rights, options and remedies hereunder shall be construed and held to be nonexclusive and cumulative. Landlord shall have the right to pursue any one or all of such remedies, or any other remedy or relief that may be provided by Applicable Laws, whether or not stated in this Lease. No waiver of any default of Tenant hereunder shall be implied from any acceptance by Landlord of any Rent or other payments due hereunder or any omission by Landlord to take any action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall affect defaults other than as specified in said waiver.</p>
          <p id="s1p262">24.9. Landlord’s termination of (a) this Lease or (b) Tenant’s right to possession of the Premises shall not relieve Tenant of any liability to Landlord that has previously accrued or that shall arise based upon events that occurred prior to the later to occur of (i) the date of Lease termination or (ii) the date Tenant surrenders possession of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p263">24.10. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, Tenant waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future Applicable Laws if Tenant is evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or if Landlord obtains possession of the Premises due to Tenant’s default hereunder or otherwise.</p>
          <p id="s1p264">24.11. Landlord shall not be in default under this Lease unless Landlord fails to perform obligations required of Landlord within a reasonable time, but in no event shall such failure to continue for more than thirty (30) days after written notice from Tenant specifying the nature of Landlord’s failure; provided, however, that if the nature of Landlord’s obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for its performance, then Landlord shall not be in default if Landlord commences performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion.</p>
          <p id="s1p265">24.12. In the event of any default by Landlord, Tenant shall give notice by registered or certified mail or by a reputable overnight courier (e.g., FedEx) to any (a) beneficiary of a deed of trust or (b) mortgagee under a mortgage covering the Premises, the Building or the Project and to any landlord of any lease of land upon or within which the Premises, the Building or the Project</p>
          <p id="s1p266">29</p>
          <p id="s1p267">is located, and shall offer such beneficiary, mortgagee or landlord a reasonable opportunity to cure the default, including time to obtain possession of the Building by power of sale or a judicial action if such should prove necessary to effect a cure; provided that Landlord shall furnish to Tenant in writing, upon written request by Tenant, the names and addresses of all such persons who are to receive such notices.</p>
          <p id="s1p268">25. Assignment or Subletting.</p>
          <p id="s1p269">25.1. Except as hereinafter provided, Tenant shall not, either voluntarily or by operation of Applicable Laws, directly or indirectly sell, hypothecate, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise transfer this Lease, or sublet the Premises or any part hereof (each, a “ Transfer”), without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may not unreasonably withhold; provided, however, that Tenant shall have the right to assign all or any portion of its interest under this Lease or sublet all or any portion of the Premises without Landlord’s consent to any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Tenant; or any party that results from a merger or consolidation of Tenant; or any party that acquires all or substantially all of the assets or stock of Tenant (an “Allowable Transfer”). Any Transfer other than an Allowable Transfer shall be referred to herein as a “Subject Transfer”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Tenant be released from any of its obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p270">25.2. In the event Tenant desires to effect a Transfer, then, at least twenty (20) days with respect to a sublease and at least thirty (30) days with respect to any other Transfer, but not more than ninety (90) days in any event, prior to the date when Tenant desires the Transfer to be effective (the “ Assignment Date”), Tenant shall provide written notice to Landlord (the “Assignment Notice”) containing information (including references) concerning the character of the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee; the Assignment Date; any ownership or commercial relationship between Tenant and the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee; and the consideration and all other material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer, all in such detail as Landlord shall reasonably require. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and other reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Landlord in reviewing Tenant’s request for such Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p271">25.3. Landlord, in determining whether consent should be given to a proposed Subject Transfer, may give consideration to the financial strength of such transferee, assignee or sublessee (notwithstanding Tenant remaining liable for Tenant’s performance), and any change in use that such transferee, assignee or sublessee proposes to make in the use of the Premises. In no event shall Landlord be deemed to be unreasonable for declining to consent to a Transfer to a transferee, assignee or sublessee of poor reputation, lacking financial qualifications, seeking a change in the Permitted Use, or jeopardizing directly or indirectly the status of Landlord or any of Landlord’s affiliates as a Real Estate Investment Trust under the Code; provided that (a) Landlord agrees to reasonably evaluate any proposed transferee’s, assignee’s or sublessee’s financial qualifications and (b) Landlord may only consider such financial qualifications in the event that, were the transfer, assignment or sublease to occur, Tenant would no longer occupy any portion of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p272">30</p>
          <p id="s1p273">25.4. As conditions precedent to Landlord’s consent to a Subject Transfer, Landlord may require any or all of the following:</p>
          <p id="s1p274">(a) Tenant shall remain fully liable under this Lease during the unexpired Term;</p>
          <p id="s1p275">(b) Tenant shall provide Landlord with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord that the value of Landlord’s interest under this Lease shall not be diminished or reduced by the proposed Subject Transfer. Such evidence shall include, without limitation, evidence respecting the relevant business experience and financial responsibility and status of the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee;</p>
          <p id="s1p276">(c) Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord’s actual costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements incurred in connection with the review, processing and documentation of such request;</p>
          <p id="s1p277">(d) If a Transfer of the Premises provides for the receipt by, on behalf of or on account of Tenant of any consideration of any kind whatsoever (including, without limitation, a premium rental for a sublease or lump sum payment for an assignment, but excluding Tenant’s reasonable costs in marketing and subleasing the Premises) in excess of the rental and other charges due to Landlord under this Lease, Tenant shall pay twenty-five percent (25%) of all of such excess to Landlord, prior to deductions for any transaction costs incurred by Tenant, including marketing expenses, tenant improvement allowances, alterations, cash concessions, brokerage commissions, attorneys’ fees and free rent. If said consideration consists of cash paid to Tenant, payment to Landlord shall be made upon receipt by Tenant of such cash payment;</p>
          <p id="s1p278">(e) The proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall agree that, in the event Landlord gives such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee notice that Tenant is in Default under this Lease, such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall thereafter make all payments otherwise due Tenant directly to Landlord, which payments shall be received by Landlord without any liability being incurred by Landlord, except to credit such payment against those due by Tenant under this Lease, and any such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee shall agree to attorn to Landlord or its successors and assigns should this Lease be terminated for any reason; provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord or its Lenders, successors or assigns be obligated to accept such attornment;</p>
          <p id="s1p279">(f) Any consent to such Transfer shall be effected on Landlord’s forms;</p>
          <p id="s1p280">(g) There shall exist no uncured Default or Imminent Default hereunder of which Tenant has been given notice by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p281">(h) Such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee’s use of the Premises shall not require any change to the Permitted Use;</p>
          <p id="s1p282">(i) Landlord shall not be bound by any provision of any agreement pertaining to the Transfer, except for Landlord’s written consent to the same;</p>
          <p id="s1p283">(j) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord one executed copy of any and all written instruments evidencing or relating to the Transfer; and</p>
          <p id="s1p284">31</p>
          <p id="s1p285">(k) A list of Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section 39.7 below), certified by the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee to be true and correct, that the proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee intends to use or store in the Premises. Additionally, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord, on or before the date any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee takes occupancy of the Premises, all of the items relating to Hazardous Materials of such proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee as described in Section 39.2.</p>
          <p id="s1p286">25.5. Any Transfer that is not in compliance with the provisions of this Section 25 shall be void.</p>
          <p id="s1p287">25.6. The consent by Landlord to a Transfer shall not relieve Tenant or proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee from obtaining Landlord’s consent to any further Subject Transfer, nor shall it release Tenant or any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee of Tenant from full and primary liability under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p288">25.7. Notwithstanding any Transfer, Tenant shall remain fully and primarily liable for the payment of all Rent and other sums due or to become due hereunder, and for the full performance of all other terms, conditions and covenants to be kept and performed by Tenant. The acceptance of Rent or any other sum due hereunder, or the acceptance of performance of any other term, covenant or condition thereof, from any person or entity other than Tenant shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the provisions of this Lease or a consent to any Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p289">25.8. [Intentionally omitted]</p>
          <p id="s1p290">25.9. If Tenant sublets the Premises or any potion thereof, Tenant hereby immediately and irrevocably assigns to Landlord, as security for Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, all rent from any such subletting, and appoints Landlord as assignee and attorney-in-fact for Tenant, and Landlord (or a receiver for Tenant appointed on Landlord’s application) may collect such rent and apply it toward Tenant’s obligations under this Lease; provided that, until the occurrence of a Default by Tenant, Tenant shall have the right to collect such rent.</p>
          <p id="s1p291">26. Attorneys’ Fees. If either party commences an action against the other party arising out of or in connection with this Lease, then the prevailing party shall be entitled to have and recover from the non-prevailing party reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements and costs of suit.</p>
          <p id="s1p292">27. Bankruptcy. In the event a debtor, trustee or debtor in possession under the Code, or another person with similar rights, duties and powers under any other Applicable Laws, proposes to cure any default under this Lease or to assume or assign this Lease and is obliged to provide adequate assurance to Landlord that (a) a default shall be cured, (b) Landlord shall be compensated for its damages arising from any breach of this Lease and (c) future performance of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease shall occur, then such adequate assurances shall include any or all of the following, as designated by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion:</p>
          <p id="s1p293">27.1. Those acts specified in the Code or other Applicable Laws as included within the meaning of “adequate assurance,” even if this Lease does not concern a shopping center or other facility described in such Applicable Laws;</p>
          <p id="s1p294">32</p>
          <p id="s1p295">27.2. A prompt cash payment to compensate Landlord for any monetary defaults or actual damages arising directly from a breach of this Lease;</p>
          <p id="s1p296">27.3. A cash deposit in an amount at least equal to the then-current amount of the Security Deposit; or</p>
          <p id="s1p297">27.4. The assumption or assignment of all of Tenant’s interest and obligations under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p298">28. Definition of Landlord. With regard to obligations imposed upon Landlord pursuant to this Lease, the term “Landlord,” as used in this Lease, shall refer only to Landlord or Landlord’s then-current successor-in-interest. In the event of any transfer, assignment or conveyance of Landlord’s interest in this Lease or in Landlord’s fee title to or leasehold interest in the Property, as applicable, Landlord herein named (and in case of any subsequent transfers or conveyances, the subsequent Landlord) shall be automatically freed and relieved, from and after the date of such transfer, assignment or conveyance, from all liability for the performance of any covenants or obligations contained in this Lease thereafter to be performed by Landlord and, without further agreement, the transferee, assignee or conveyee of Landlord’s in this Lease or in Landlord’s fee title to or leasehold interest in the Property, as applicable, shall be deemed to have assumed and agreed to observe and perform any and all covenants and obligations of Landlord hereunder during the tenure of its interest in the Lease or the Property, in each case to the extent that the transferee, assignee or conveyee assumes in writing such covenants and obligations. Landlord or any subsequent Landlord may transfer its interest in the Premises or this Lease without Tenant’s consent.</p>
          <p id="s1p299">29. Estoppel Certificate. Tenant shall, within ten (10) business days of receipt of written notice from Landlord, execute, acknowledge and deliver a statement in writing substantially in the form attached to this Lease as Exhibit E, or on any other form reasonably requested by a proposed Lender or purchaser, (a) certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease as so modified is in full force and effect) and the dates to which rental and other charges are paid in advance, if any, (b) acknowledging that there are not, to Tenant’s knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of Landlord hereunder, or specifying such defaults if any are claimed, and (c) setting forth such further information with respect to this Lease or the Premises as may be requested thereon. Any such statement may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of all or any portion of the real property of which the Premises are a part. Tenant’s failure to deliver such statement within such the prescribed time shall be binding upon Tenant that the Lease is in full force and effect and without modification except as may be represented by Landlord in any certificate prepared by Landlord and delivered to Tenant for execution.</p>
          <p id="s1p300">30. Joint and Several Obligations. If more than one person or entity executes this Lease as Tenant, then:</p>
          <p id="s1p301">30.1. Each of them is jointly and severally liable for the keeping, observing and performing of all of the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions and agreements of this Lease to be kept, observed or performed by Tenant; and</p>
          <p id="s1p302">33</p>
          <p id="s1p303">30.2. The term “ Tenant” as used in this Lease shall mean and include each of them, jointly and severally. The act of, notice from, notice to, refund to, or signature of any one or more of them with respect to the tenancy under this Lease, including, without limitation, any renewal, extension, expiration, termination or modification of this Lease, shall be binding upon each and all of the persons executing this Lease as Tenant with the same force and effect as if each and all of them had so acted, so given or received such notice or refund, or so signed.</p>
          <p id="s1p304">31. Limitation of Landlord’s Liability.</p>
          <p id="s1p305">31.1. If Landlord is in default under this Lease and, as a consequence, Tenant recovers a monetary judgment against Landlord, the judgment shall be satisfied only out of (a) the proceeds of sale received on execution of the judgment and levy against the right, title and interest of Landlord in the Building and the Project of which the Premises are a part, (b) rent or other income from such real property receivable by Landlord or (c) the consideration received by Landlord from the sale, financing, refinancing or other disposition of all or any part of Landlord’s right, title or interest in the Building or the Project of which the Premises are a part.</p>
          <p id="s1p306">31.2. Landlord shall not be personally liable for any deficiency under this Lease. If Landlord is a partnership or joint venture, then the partners of such partnership shall not be personally liable for Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, and no partner of Landlord shall be sued or named as a party in any suit or action, and service of process shall not be made against any partner of Landlord except as may be necessary to secure jurisdiction of the partnership or joint venture. If Landlord is a corporation, then the shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents of such corporation shall not be personally liable for Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, and no shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of Landlord shall be sued or named as a party in any suit or action, and service of process shall not be made against any shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of Landlord. If Landlord is a limited liability company, then the members of such limited liability company shall not be personally liable for Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, and no member of Landlord shall be sued or named as a party in any suit or action, and service of process shall not be made against any member of Landlord except as may be necessary to secure jurisdiction of the limited liability company. No partner, shareholder, director, employee, member or agent of Landlord shall be required to answer or otherwise plead to any service of process, and no judgment shall be taken or writ of execution levied against any partner, shareholder, director, employee or agent of Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p307">31.3. Each of the covenants and agreements of this Section 31 shall be applicable to any covenant or agreement either expressly contained in this Lease or imposed by Applicable Laws and shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p308">32. Project Control by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p309">32.1. Landlord reserves full control over the Building and the Project to the extent not inconsistent with Tenant’s enjoyment of the Premises as provided by this Lease. This reservation includes, without limitation, Landlord’s right to subdivide the Project, convert the Building and other buildings within the Project to condominium units, grant easements and licenses to third parties, and maintain or establish ownership of the Building separate from fee title to the Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p310">34</p>
          <p id="s1p311">32.2. Tenant shall, at Landlord’s request, promptly execute such further documents as may be reasonably appropriate to assist Landlord in the performance of its obligations hereunder; provided that Tenant need not execute any document that creates additional liability for Tenant or that deprives Tenant of the quiet enjoyment and use of the Premises as provided by this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p312">32.3. Landlord may, at any and all reasonable times during non-business hours (or during business hours if Tenant so requests), and upon twenty-four (24) hours’ prior notice (provided that no time restrictions shall apply or advance notice be required if an emergency necessitates immediate entry), enter the Premises to (a) inspect the same and to determine whether Tenant is in compliance with its obligations hereunder, (b) supply any service Landlord is required to provide hereunder, (c) show the Premises to prospective purchasers or tenants during the last nine (9) months of the Term, (d) post notices of nonresponsibility, (e) access the telephone equipment, electrical substation and fire risers and (f) alter, improve or repair any portion of the Building other than the Premises for which access to the Premises is reasonably necessary. In connection with any such alteration, improvement or repair as described in Subsection 32.3(f) above, Landlord may erect in the Premises or elsewhere in the Project scaffolding and other structures reasonably required for the alteration, improvement or repair work to be performed. In no event shall Tenant’s Rent abate as a result of Landlord’s activities pursuant to this Section 32.3; provided, however, that all such activities shall be conducted in such a manner so as to cause as little interference to Tenant as is reasonably possible. Landlord shall at all times retain a key with which to unlock all of the doors in the Premises. If an emergency involving risk of serious injury or damage to persons or property necessitates immediate access to the Premises, Landlord may use whatever force is necessary to enter the Premises, and any such entry to the Premises shall not constitute a forcible or unlawful entry to the Premises, a detainer of the Premises, or an eviction of Tenant from the Premises or any portion thereof. Except in the event of an emergency involving the risk of serious injury or damage to persons or property, any entry of the Premises pursuant to this Section 32.3 (other than for routine janitorial service) shall be arranged in advance with Tenant, and all such entries shall be guided by a Tenant representative; provided that Tenant shall make such a representative reasonably available. Under no circumstances shall any party be allowed to enter the reference lab located in the Premises, but parties shall be permitted to view the reference lab through an open door while standing outside the reference lab.</p>
          <p id="s1p313">33. Quiet Enjoyment. So long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease, Landlord or anyone acting through or under Landlord shall not disturb Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises, except as permitted by this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p314">34. Subordination and Attornment.</p>
          <p id="s1p315">34.1. This Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any mortgage, deed of trust, or lease in which Landlord is tenant now or hereafter in force against the Building or the Project and to all advances made or hereafter to be made upon the security thereof without the necessity of the execution and delivery of any further instruments on the part of Tenant to effectuate such subordination.</p>
          <p id="s1p316">35</p>
          <p id="s1p317">34.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall execute and deliver upon demand such further instrument or instruments evidencing such subordination of this Lease to the lien of any such mortgage or mortgages or deeds of trust or lease in which Landlord is tenant as may be required by Landlord, subject to the delivery to Tenant, at no cost to Landlord, of a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement from the holder of each such mortgage deed of trust or from such lessor substantially in the form attached as Exhibit F hereto, which requires such holder or lessor to accept this Lease, and not to disturb Tenant’s possession, so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease (a “Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement”). However, if any such mortgagee, beneficiary or landlord under lease wherein Landlord is tenant so elects, this Lease shall be deemed prior in lien to any such lease, mortgage, or deed of trust upon or including the Premises regardless of date and Tenant shall execute a statement in writing to such effect at Landlord’s request. If Tenant fails to execute any document required from Tenant under this Section within ten (10) business days after written request therefor, Tenant hereby constitutes and appoints Landlord as its special attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver any such document or documents in the name of Tenant. Such power is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.</p>
          <p id="s1p318">34.3. In the event any proceedings are brought for foreclosure, or in the event of the exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage or deed of trust made by the Landlord covering the Premises, the Tenant shall at the election of the purchaser at such foreclosure or sale attorn to the purchaser upon any such foreclosure or sale and recognize such purchaser as the Landlord under this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p319">34.4. Within thirty (30) days after the execution of this Lease by both parties, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Tenant executed by each holder of a mortgage or deed of trust covering the Premises. The execution and/or delivery by any such holder of such a Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement is a condition precedent to Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, and Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by written notice provided to Landlord within ten (10) days after the expiration of such initial thirty (30) day period, if such condition precedent is not satisfied in a timely manner; provided that Landlord shall have ten (10) business days after receipt of such written notice from Tenant to provide such Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement to Tenant. If Tenant fails to timely terminate this Lease as set forth in the preceding sentence, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this Lease pursuant to this Section 34.4. Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant that there is currently no ground lease to which Landlord is a party affecting the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p320">35. Surrender.</p>
          <p id="s1p321">35.1. No surrender of possession of any part of the Premises shall release Tenant from any of its obligations hereunder, unless such surrender is accepted in writing by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p322">35.2. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant shall not effect a merger with Landlord’s fee title or leasehold interest in the Premises, the Building or the Property, unless Landlord consents in writing, and shall, at Landlord’s option, operate as an assignment to Landlord of any or all subleases.</p>
          <p id="s1p323">36</p>
          <p id="s1p324">35.3. The voluntary or other surrender of any ground or other underlying lease that now exists or may hereafter be executed affecting the Building or the Project, or a mutual cancellation thereof or of Landlord’s interest therein by Landlord and its lessor shall not effect a merger with Landlord’s fee title or leasehold interest in the Premises, the Building or the Property and shall, at the option of the successor to Landlord’s interest in the Building or the Project, as applicable, operate as an assignment of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p325">36. Waiver and Modification. No provision of this Lease may be modified, amended or supplemented except by an agreement in writing signed by Landlord and Tenant. The waiver by Landlord of any breach by Tenant of any term, covenant or condition herein contained shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition herein contained.</p>
          <p id="s1p326">37. Waiver of Jury Trial and Counterclaims. The parties waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by the other party hereto related to matters arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease; the relationship between Landlord and Tenant; Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, the Building or the Project; or any claim of injury or damage related to this Lease or the Premises, the Building or the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p327">38. [Intentionally omitted]</p>
          <p id="s1p328">39. Hazardous Materials.</p>
          <p id="s1p329">39.1. Tenant shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Materials (as hereinafter defined) to be brought upon, kept or used in or about the Premises, the Building or the Project in violation of Applicable Laws by Tenant, its agents, employees, contractors or invitees. If (a) Tenant breaches such obligation, or if the presence of Hazardous Materials as a result of such a breach results in contamination of the Premises, the Building, the Project or any adjacent property, or (b) contamination of the Premises, the Building, the Project or any adjacent property by Hazardous Materials caused by Tenant or its agents, consultants, employees or invitees otherwise occurs during the term of this Lease or any extension or renewal hereof or holding over hereunder, then Tenant shall indemnify, save, defend and hold Landlord, its agents and contractors harmless from and against any and all claims, judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs, liabilities and losses (including, without limitation, diminution in value of the Premises, the Building, the Project or any portion thereof; damages for the loss or restriction on use of rentable or usable space or of any amenity of the Premises or Project; damages arising from any adverse impact on marketing of space in the Premises, the Building or the Project; and sums paid in settlement of claims, attorneys’ fees, consultants’ fees and experts’ fees) that arise during or after the Term as a result of such breach or contamination. This indemnification of Landlord by Tenant includes, without limitation, costs incurred in connection with any investigation of site conditions or any cleanup, remedial, removal or restoration work required by any Governmental Authority because of Hazardous Materials present in the air, soil or groundwater above, on or under the Premises. Without limiting the foregoing, if the presence of any Hazardous Materials in, on, under or about the Premises, the Building, the Project or any adjacent property caused or permitted by Tenant results in any contamination of the Premises, the Building, the Project or any adjacent property, then Tenant shall promptly take all actions at its sole cost and expense as are necessary to return the Premises, the Building, the Project and any adjacent property to their</p>
          <p id="s1p330">37</p>
          <p id="s1p331">respective condition existing prior to the time of such contamination; provided that Landlord’s written approval of such action shall first be obtained, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold; and provided, further, that it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent if such actions could have a material adverse long-term or short-term effect on the Premises, the Building or the Project.</p>
          <p id="s1p332">39.2. Landlord acknowledges that it is not the intent of this Section 39 to prohibit Tenant from operating its business as described in Section 2.12 above. Tenant may operate its business according to the custom of Tenant’s industry so long as the use or presence of Hazardous Materials is strictly and properly monitored according to Applicable Laws. As a material inducement to Landlord to allow Tenant to use Hazardous Materials in connection with its business, Tenant agrees to deliver to Landlord prior to the Term Commencement Date a list identifying each type of Hazardous Material to be present on the Premises and setting forth any and all governmental approvals or permits required in connection with the presence of such Hazardous Material on the Premises (the “Hazardous Materials List”). Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an updated Hazardous Materials List on or prior to each annual anniversary of the Term Commencement Date and shall also deliver an updated Hazardous Materials List before any new Hazardous Materials are brought onto the Premises. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord true and correct copies of the following documents (hereinafter referred to as the “Documents”) relating to the handling, storage, disposal and emission of Hazardous Materials prior to the Term Commencement Date or, if unavailable at that time, concurrent with the receipt from or submission to any Governmental Authority: permits; approvals; reports and correspondence; storage and management plans; notices of violations of Applicable Laws; plans relating to the installation of any storage tanks to be installed in or under the Premises, the Building or the Project (provided that installation of storage tanks shall only be permitted after Landlord has given Tenant its written consent to do so, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion); and all closure plans or any other documents required by any and all Governmental Authority for any storage tanks installed in, on or under the Premises, the Building or the Project for the closure of any such storage tanks. Tenant shall not be required, however, to provide Landlord with any portion of the Documents containing information of a proprietary nature that, in and of themselves, do not contain a reference to any Hazardous Materials or activities related to Hazardous Materials. Upon Landlord’s written request, Tenant agrees that it shall enter into a written agreement with other tenants of the Building and the Project concerning the equitable allocation of fire control areas (as defined in the Uniform Building Code as adopted by the City of Brisbane (the “UBC”)) within the Building and the Project for the storage of Hazardous Materials. In the event that Tenant’s use of Hazardous Materials is such that it utilizes fire control areas in the Building or the Project in excess of Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building or the Project, as applicable, as set forth in Section 2.8, Tenant agrees that it shall, at its sole cost and expense and upon Landlord’s written request, establish and maintain a separate area of the Premises classified by the UBC as an “H” occupancy area for the use and storage of Hazardous Materials or take such other action as is necessary to ensure that its share of the fire control areas of the Building and the Project is not greater than Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the Building or the Project, as applicable.</p>
          <p id="s1p333">38</p>
          <p id="s1p334">39.3. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 39.1 above, if (a) Tenant or any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee of Tenant has been required by any prior landlord, Lender or Governmental Authority to take remedial action in connection with Hazardous Materials contaminating a property if the contamination resulted from such party’s action or omission or use of the property in question or (ii) Tenant or any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee is subject to an enforcement order issued by any Governmental Authority in connection with the use, disposal or storage of Hazardous Materials, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion (with respect to any such matter involving Tenant), and it shall not be unreasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any proposed transfer, assignment or subletting (with respect to any such matter involving a proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee).</p>
          <p id="s1p335">39.4. At any time, and from time to time, prior to the expiration of the Term, Landlord shall have the right to conduct appropriate tests of the Premises, the Building and the Project to demonstrate that Hazardous Materials are present or that contamination has occurred due to Tenant or Tenant’s agents, employees or invitees. Tenant shall pay all reasonable costs of such tests of the Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p336">39.5. If underground or other storage tanks storing Hazardous Materials are hereafter placed on the Premises by Tenant, Tenant shall monitor the storage tanks, maintain appropriate records, implement reporting procedures, properly close any underground storage tanks, and take or cause to be taken all other steps necessary or required under the Applicable Laws.</p>
          <p id="s1p337">39.6. Tenant’s obligations under this Section 39 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease. During any period of time needed by Tenant or Landlord after the termination of this Lease to complete the removal from the Premises of any such Hazardous Materials, Tenant shall continue to pay Rent in accordance with this Lease, which Rent shall be prorated daily.</p>
          <p id="s1p338">39.7. As used herein, the term “Hazardous Material” means any hazardous or toxic substance, material or waste that is or becomes regulated by any Governmental Authority.</p>
          <p id="s1p339">39.8. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 39 to the contrary, Landlord shall indemnify Tenant for any pre-existing environmental conditions present at the Building upon the date Tenant takes possession of any portion of the Premises, whether to conduct Tenant’s normal business or to begin construction of tenant improvements. Tenant may engage, at its sole cost, an environmental consultant to conduct an environmental study in order to obtain a baseline of any pre-existing environmental conditions of the Premises; provided that Landlord shall not be deemed to have affirmed any data or conclusions reported in such study.</p>
          <p id="s1p340">40. [Intentionally omitted]</p>

          <p id="s1p354">40</p>
          <p id="s1p355">41.12. This Lease shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State in which the Premises are located, without regard to such State’s conflict of law principles.</p>
          <p id="s1p356">41.13.

          <p id="s1p358">41.15. This Lease may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the same document.</p>
          <p id="s1p359">42. Options to Extend Term. Tenant shall have options (each, an “Option”) to extend the Term of this Lease upon the following terms and conditions:</p>
          <p id="s1p360">42.1. Tenant shall have two (2) consecutive Options to extend the Term of this Lease by three (3) years each on the same terms and conditions as this Lease. Basic Annual Rent shall equal ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair market value (“FMV”) for comparable office/research and development projects in the Brisbane/Peninsula market as of the date Tenant exercises the respective Option, increased on each annual anniversary of the commencement of each extended term by such percentage, if any, that constitutes a market rate annual increase for such market. In the event that Landlord and Tenant disagree as to the FMV, they shall hire an appraiser reasonably acceptable to both parties, the cost of which shall be split equally by Landlord and Tenant, which appraiser’s decision as to the FMV shall be binding on both parties.</p>
          <p id="s1p361">42.2. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not assign or transfer an Option, either separately or in conjunction with an assignment or transfer of Tenant’s interest in this Lease, without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
          <p id="s1p362">42.3. The Options are conditional upon Tenant giving Landlord written notice of its election to exercise the applicable Option at least nine (9) months prior to the end of the expiration of the then-current Term of this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p363">41</p>
          <p id="s1p364">42.4. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 42, Tenant shall not have the right to exercise an Option:</p>
          <p id="s1p365">(a) During the time commencing from the date Landlord delivers to Tenant a written notice that Tenant is in default under any provisions of this Lease and continuing until Tenant has cured the specified default to Landlord’s reasonable satisfaction; or</p>
          <p id="s1p366">(b) At any time after an event of Default as described in Section 24 of the Lease (provided, however, that, for purposes of this Subsection 42.4(b), Landlord shall not be required to provide Tenant with notice of such Default) and continuing until Tenant cures any such Default, if such Default is susceptible to being cured; or</p>
          <p id="s1p367">(c) In the event that Tenant has committed a Default two (2) or more times and a service or late charge has become payable under Section 24.1 for each of such Defaults during the twelve (12)-month period immediately prior to the date that Tenant intends to exercise the Option, whether or not Tenant cures such Defaults within any applicable cure period.</p>
          <p id="s1p368">42.5. The period of time within which Tenant may exercise an Option shall not be extended or enlarged by reason of Tenant’s inability to exercise such Option because of the provisions of Section 42.4.</p>
          <p id="s1p369">42.6. All of Tenant’s rights under the provisions of the Option shall terminate and be of no further force or effect even after Tenant’s due and timely exercise of an Option if, after such exercise, but prior to the commencement date of the new term, (a) Tenant fails to pay to Landlord a monetary obligation of Tenant for a period of twenty (20) days after written notice from Landlord to Tenant, (b) Tenant fails to commence to cure a default (other than a monetary default) within thirty (30) days after the date Landlord gives notice to Tenant of such default or (c) Tenant has defaulted under this Lease three (3) or more times and a service or late charge under Section 24.1 has become payable for any such default, whether or not Tenant has cured such defaults.</p>
          <p id="s1p370">43. Right of First Refusal. During the first (1st) three (3) years after the Term Commencement Date, Tenant shall have a right of first refusal (“ROFR”) as to any rentable premises in the Building for which Landlord is seeking a tenant (“Available Premises”). In the event Landlord receives a bonafide offer to lease from a third party tenant the Available Premises, which offer is acceptable to Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion, Landlord shall provide written notice thereof to Tenant (the “Notice of Offer”), specifying the material terms and conditions of a proposed lease to Tenant of the Available Premises, which shall be the same as the terms of the bonafide offer, except that the term of any lease entered into by Tenant with respect to the Available Premises shall be coterminous with the Term.</p>
          <p id="s1p371">43.1. Within five (5) business days following its receipt of a Notice of Offer, Tenant shall advise Landlord in writing whether Tenant elects to lease the Available Premises on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Offer. If Tenant fails to notify Landlord of Tenant’s election within said five (5) business day period, then Tenant shall be deemed to have elected not to lease the Available Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p372">42</p>
          <p id="s1p373">43.2. If Tenant timely notifies Landlord that Tenant elects to lease the Available Premises on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Offer, then Landlord shall lease the Available Premises to Tenant upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Offer.</p>
          <p id="s1p374">43.3. If Tenant notifies Landlord that Tenant elects not to lease the Available Premises on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Offer, or if Tenant fails to notify Landlord of Tenant’s election within the five (5) business day period described above, then Landlord shall have the right to consummate the lease of the Available Premises on the same terms as set forth in the Notice of Offer to a third party tenant.</p>
          <p id="s1p375">43.4. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 43 to the contrary, Tenant shall not exercise the ROFR during such period of time that Tenant is in default under any provision of this Lease. Any attempted exercise of the ROFR during a period of time in which Tenant is so in Default shall be void and of no effect. In addition, Tenant shall not be entitled to exercise the ROFR if Tenant has committed a Default two (2) or more times during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date on which Tenant seeks to exercise the ROFR, whether or not Tenant cures such Defaults within any applicable cure period.</p>
          <p id="s1p376">43.5. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not assign or transfer the ROFR, either separately or in conjunction with an assignment or transfer of Tenant’s interest in the Lease, without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that Landlord’s consent shall not be required for Tenant’s assignment of the ROFR in connection with an Allowed Transfer.</p>

          <p id="s1p525">(v) Bound to Tenant subsequent to the date upon which Successor Landlord transfers its interest in the Demised Premises to any third party;</p>
          <p id="s1p526">(vi) Liable to Tenant under any indemnification provisions set forth in the Lease; or</p>
          <p id="s1p527">(vii) Liable for any damages in excess of Successor Landlord’s equity in the Property.</p>
          <p id="s1p528">The provisions of this paragraph shall be effective and self-operative immediately upon Successor Landlord succeeding to the interests of Borrower without the execution of any other instrument.</p>

          <p id="s1p584">This Work Letter (the “Work Letter”) is made and entered into as of April 27, 2006, by and between BMR-BAYSHORE BOULEVARD LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Landlord”), and EXPRESSION DIAGNOSTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (“Tenant”), and is attached to and made a part of that certain Lease dated as of April 27, 2006 (the “Lease”), by and between Landlord and Tenant for the Premises located at 3260 Bayshore Boulevard Brisbane, California. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given them in the Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p585">1. General Requirements.</p>
          <p id="s1p586">1.1. Tenant’s Authorized Representative. Tenant designates Vikram Jog, Steve Langford and Avi Kulkarni (each, “Tenant’s Authorized Representative”) as the persons authorized to initial all plans, drawings, changes orders and approvals pursuant to this Work Letter. Landlord shall not be obligated to respond to or act upon any such item until such item has been initialed by any Tenant’s Authorized Representative.</p>
          <p id="s1p587">1.2. Schedule. The schedule for design and development of Tenant’s Work (as hereinafter defined), including, without limitation, the time periods for preparation and review of construction documents, approvals and performance, shall be in accordance with a schedule prepared by Tenant (the “Schedule”), which Schedule shall be subject to Landlord’s reasonable approval.

Tenant shall submit such design drawings, plans and specifications as Landlord may reasonably request (the “Tenant Work Plans”). Tenant shall prepare and submit to Landlord for approval schematics covering Tenant’s Work prepared in conformity with the applicable provisions of this Work Letter (the “Draft Plans”). The Draft Plans shall contain sufficient information and detail to accurately describe Tenant’s proposed design to Landlord and such other information as Landlord may reasonably request. Tenant shall</p>
          <p id="s1p591">be solely responsible for ensuring that the Tenant Work Plans and the Draft Plans satisfy Tenant’s obligations for Tenant’s Work.</p>
          <p id="s1p592">1</p>
          <p id="s1p593">2.2. Landlord Approval of Plans. Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Draft Plans whether Landlord approves or objects to the Draft Plans and of the manner, if any, in which the Draft Plans are unacceptable. Landlord shall not object to any Draft Plans that satisfy the requirements set forth in Section 2.1. If Landlord objects to the Draft Plans, then Tenant shall revise the Draft Plans and cause Landlord’s objections to be remedied in the revised Draft Plans. Tenant shall then resubmit the revised Draft Plans to Landlord for approval. Landlord’s approval of or objection to revised Draft Plans and Tenant’s correction of the same shall be in accordance with this Section 2.2. until Landlord has approved the Draft Plans in writing.

Landlord shall give Tenant notice in writing of its approval or disapproval of the Contractor List with five (5) business days after Landlord’s receipt of the same. If Landlord disapproves of one or more parties on the Contractor List, Tenant shall revise the Contractor List and resubmit the same to Landlord for Landlord’s approval in accordance with the preceding two sentences. For all subcontracts in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), Tenant shall require its general contractor to provide Tenant with at least three (3) competitive bids.</p>
          <p id="s1p596">2.5. Requests for Consent. Landlord shall respond to all requests for consents, approvals or directions made by Tenant pursuant to this Work Letter within five (5) business days following Landlord’s receipt of such request. Landlord’s failure to respond within such five (5) business day period shall be deemed approval by Landlord.</p>
          <p id="s1p597">3. Tenant’s Construction Obligations Shall Not Delay Commencement of the Term. Notwithstanding any Tenant Work to be performed by Tenant, the commencement of the Term and Tenant’s obligation to pay Rent shall not, under any circumstance, be extended or delayed, except to the extent that completion of the Tenant Work is delayed caused by Force Majeure or by Landlord’s failure to comply in a timely manner with its obligations under the Lease or this Work Letter.

Such policy shall, on a completed values basis for the full insurable value at all times, insure against loss or damage by fire, vandalism and malicious mischief and other such risks as are customarily covered by the so-called “broad form extended coverage endorsement” upon all Tenant’s Work and the general contractor’s and any subcontractors’ machinery, tools and equipment, all while each forms a part of, or is contained in, Tenant’s Work or any temporary structures on the Premises, or is adjacent thereto. Said Builder’s All-Risk Insurance shall contain an express waiver of any right of subrogation by the insurer against Landlord and its affiliates, agents and employees.</p>
          <p id="s1p603">5.2. Workers’ Compensation. At all times during the period of construction of Tenant’s Work, Tenant shall, or shall cause its contractors or subcontractors to, maintain statutory Workers’ Compensation insurance as required by Applicable Laws.</p>

Any deficiency in design or construction of Tenant’s Work shall be solely the responsibility of Tenant, notwithstanding the fact that Landlord may have approved of the same in writing. All material and equipment furnished by Tenant as Tenant’s Work shall be new or “like new” and Tenant’s Work shall be performed in a first-class, workmanlike manner.</p>

Landlord shall not be obligated to reimburse Tenant for costs or expenses relating to Tenant’s Work that exceed either (a) the amount of the Tenant Improvement Allowance (and, if requested by Tenant, the Additional TI Allowance), other than pursuant to Section 8.2, or (b) the Approved Budget, either on a line item or overall basis, provided, however, that Tenant shall have the right to apply cost savings in any one or more line items (not to exceed ten percent (10%) of any such line item) to any other line item(s).</p>

          <p id="s1p661">that the commencement date of the Additional Premises shall be the Additional Premises Delivery Date (the “ Additional Premises Commencement Date”), (b) that, as of the Additional Premises Commencement Date, the Premises under the Lease shall be increased to include the Additional Premises for a total of sixty-one thousand four hundred forty-four (61,444) square feet of Rentable Area (together, the Premises and the Additional Premises shall be referred to hereinafter as the “Total Premises”), (c) the new Basic Annual Rent applicable to the Total Premises, which shall commence on the Additional Premises Commencement Date and shall be as further described in Section 4.2 of this Amendment, (d) Tenant’s new Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses as of the Additional Premises Commencement Date, which Pro Rata Share shall equal one hundred percent (100%) of the Building and thirty-three and 51/100 percent (33.51%) of the Project and (e) that, in addition to the parking which Tenant is entitled to under the terms of the Lease with respect to the original Premises, Tenant, for so long as Tenant leases the Additional Premises, shall have a non-exclusive license to use the parking facilities serving the Building in common on an unreserved basis with other tenants of the Building and the Project at a ratio of 3.3 parking spaces per 1,000 rentable square feet of Additional Premises, which amounts to fifty-one (51) additional parking spaces, which number shall include three (3) additional Reserved Spaces. In the event the Additional Premises is not ready for delivery to Tenant in the Required Condition on the Additional Premises Delivery Date, then (x) this Amendment and the Lease shall not be void or voidable, (y) Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom and (z) the new Basic Annual Rent applicable to the Premises shall be as further described in Section 4.3 of this Amendment.</p>

          <p id="s1p688">6. Condition of Premises. Tenant acknowledges that (a) it is in possession of and is fully familiar with the condition of the Premises and, notwithstanding anything contained in the Lease to the contrary, agrees to take the same in its condition “as is” as of the first day of the Extension Term, and (b) Landlord shall have no obligation to alter, repair or otherwise prepare the Premises for Tenant’s continued occupancy for the Extension Term or to pay for any improvements to the Premises, except as may be expressly provided in the Lease. In the event Landlord delivers the Additional Premises, Landlord agrees that the existing laboratory casework (as shown on Exhibit A attached hereto), flooring, ceiling, HVAC and other Building systems serving the Additional Premises shall be in good working order and the Additional Premises shall be vacant, in broom clean condition, and, to Landlord’s knowledge, the Additional Premises shall be decommissioned pursuant to and otherwise in compliance with Applicable Laws (the “Required Condition”). Tenant’s acceptance of the Additional Premises shall be conclusive proof that the Additional Premises was delivered in the Required Condition.</p>
          <p id="s1p689">7. Right of First Refusal. In the event the Additional Premises is not delivered to Tenant by the Additional Premises Delivery Date, for so long as Tenant still leases and occupies the entire Premises, Tenant shall have a right of first refusal (“ROFR”) as to any rentable premises in the Building for which Landlord is seeking a tenant (“Available ROFR Premises”); provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord be required to lease any Available ROFR Premises to Tenant for any period past the date on which this Lease expires or is terminated pursuant to its terms. In the event Landlord intends to lease Available ROFR Premises, Landlord shall provide written notice thereof to Tenant (the “Notice of Offer”), specifying the terms and conditions of a proposed lease to Tenant of the Available ROFR Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p690">7.1 Within ten (10) days following its receipt of a Notice of Offer, Tenant shall advise Landlord in writing whether Tenant elects to lease all (not just a portion) of the Available ROFR Premises on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Offer. If Tenant fails to notify Landlord of Tenant’s election within said ten (10) day period, then Tenant shall be deemed to have elected not to lease the Available ROFR Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p691">3</p>
          <p id="s1p692">7.2 If Tenant timely notifies Landlord that Tenant elects to lease the Available ROFR Premises on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Offer, then Landlord shall lease the Available ROFR Premises to Tenant upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Offer.</p>
          <p id="s1p693">7.3 If Tenant notifies Landlord that Tenant elects not to lease the Available ROFR Premises on the terms and conditions set forth in the Notice of Offer, or if Tenant fails to notify Landlord of Tenant’s election within the ten (10)-day period described above, then Landlord shall have the right to consummate the lease of the Available ROFR Premises on the same terms as set forth in the Notice of Offer following Tenant’s election (or deemed election) not to lease the Available ROFR Premises.</p>
          <p id="s1p694">7.4 Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, Tenant shall not exercise the ROFR during such period of time that Tenant is in default under any provision of this Lease. Any attempted exercise of the ROFR during a period of time in which Tenant is so in default shall be void and of no effect. In addition, Tenant shall not be entitled to exercise the ROFR if Landlord has given Tenant two (2) or more notices of default under this Lease, whether or not the defaults are cured, during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date on which Tenant seeks to exercise the ROFR.</p>
          <p id="s1p695">7.5 Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not assign or transfer the ROFR, either separately or in conjunction with an assignment or transfer of Tenant’s interest in the Lease, without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that Landlord’s consent shall not be required for Tenant’s assignment of the ROFR in connection with an Allowable Transfer.</p>
          <p id="s1p696">7.6 If Tenant exercises the ROFR, Landlord does not guarantee that the Available ROFR Premises will be available on the anticipated commencement date for the Lease as to such Premises due to a holdover by the then-existing occupants of the Available ROFR Premises or for any other reason beyond Landlord’s reasonable control.</p>
          <p id="s1p697">8. Termination Right. The termination right set forth in Section 3.3 of the Lease shall be deleted in its entirety and shall have no further force or effect.</p>
          <p id="s1p698">9. No encumbrances. As of the Execution Date, the Property is not encumbered by any deed of trust or mortgage or subject to any ground lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 9 shall not prevent Landlord from encumbering or ground leasing the Property at any time in the future.</p>
          <p id="s1p699">10. Broker. Tenant represents and warrants that it has not dealt with any broker or agent in the negotiation for or the obtaining of this Amendment, other than CresaPartners (“Broker”), and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from any and all cost or liability for compensation claimed by any such broker or agent, other than Broker, employed or engaged by it or claiming to have been employed or engaged by it. Broker is entitled to a leasing commission in connection with the making of this Amendment, and Landlord shall pay such commission to Broker pursuant to a separate agreement between Landlord and Broker.</p>
          <p id="s1p700">4</p>
          <p id="s1p701">11. No Default. Tenant represents, warrants and covenants that, to the best of Tenant’s knowledge, Tenant is not in default of any of its respective obligations under the Lease and no event has occurred that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice (or both) would constitute a default by Tenant thereunder. Landlord represents, warrants and covenants that, to the best of Landlord’s knowledge, Landlord is not in default of any of its respective obligations under the Lease and no event has occurred that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice (or both) would constitute a default by or Landlord thereunder.</p>
          <p id="s1p702">12. Effect of Amendment. Except as modified by this Amendment, the Lease and all the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions thereof shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and affirmed. The covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions contained in this Amendment shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and, except as otherwise provided in the Lease, their respective assigns. In the event of any conflict between the terms contained in this Amendment and the Lease, the terms herein contained shall supersede and control the obligations and liabilities of the parties. From and after the date hereof, the term “Lease” as used in the Lease shall mean the Lease, as modified by this Amendment.</p>
          <p id="s1p703">13. Miscellaneous. This Amendment becomes effective only upon execution and delivery hereof by Landlord and Tenant. The captions of the paragraphs and subparagraphs in this Amendment are inserted and included solely for convenience and shall not be considered or given any effect in construing the provisions hereof. All exhibits hereto are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
          <p id="s1p704">14. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the same document.</p>
