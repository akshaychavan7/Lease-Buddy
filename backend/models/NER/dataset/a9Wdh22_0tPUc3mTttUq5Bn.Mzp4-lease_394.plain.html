          <p id="s1p497">(A) In this paragraph, the “President” is the President for the time being of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or a person acting on his behalf, and the Surveyor is the independent valuer appointed pursuant to paragraph 4.21(J).</p>
          <p id="s1p498">(B) The Car Parking Rent shall be reviewed on each Review Date with effect from and including the relevant Review Date, the reviewed rent to become payable as the Car Parking Rent reserved by this Lease.</p>
          <p id="s1p499">(C) The reviewed rent for a Review Date shall be determined by multiplying the relevant Base Rent by the Index for the month of October immediately before the relevant Review Date, then dividing the product by the Index value for the Base RPI Month in the previous calendar year, provided that:</p>
          <p id="s1p500">(i) if this calculation would result in an annual increase of more than three per cent, the increase will be deemed to be three per cent; and</p>

          <p id="s1p502">(ii) if this calculation would result in an increase of less than one per cent or a decrease, the increase will be deemed to be an increase of one per cent.</p>
          <p id="s1p503">(D) The Landlord shall calculate the indexed rent as soon as reasonably practicable and shall give the Tenant written notice of the indexed rent as soon as it has been calculated,</p>
          <p id="s1p504">(E) If the revised Car Parking Rent has not been calculated by the Landlord and notified to the Tenant at least five Business Days before a Review Date, the Car Parking Rent payable from that Review Date shall continue at the rate payable immediately before that Review Date. No later than five Business Days after the revised Car Parking Rent is notified by the Landlord to the Tenant, the Tenant shall pay:</p>
          <p id="s1p505">(i) the shortfall (if any) between the amount that it has paid for the period from the Review Date until the Rent Payment Date following the date of notification of the revised Car Parking Rent and the amount that would have been payable had the revised Car Parking Rent been notified on or before that Review Date; and</p>
          <p id="s1p506">(ii) interest at the Interest Rate on that shortfall calculated on a daily basis by reference to the Rent Payment Dates on which parts of the shortfall would have been payable if the revised Car Parking Rent had been notified on or before that Review Date and the date payment is received by the Landlord.</p>

          <p id="s1p508">(G) Subject to paragraph 4.21(H), if there is any change to the methods used to compile the RPI, including any change to the items from which the Index is compiled, or if the reference case used to compile the RPI changes, the calculation of the indexed rent shall be made taking into account the effect of this change.</p>
          <p id="s1p509">(H) The Landlord and the Tenant shall endeavour, within a reasonable time, to agree an alternative mechanism for setting the Car Parking Rent if either:</p>
          <p id="s1p510">(i) the Landlord and the Tenant reasonably believes that any change referred to in paragraph 4.21(G) would fundamentally alter the calculation of the indexed rent in accordance with this paragraph 4.21, and has given notice to the other party of this belief; or</p>
          <p id="s1p511">(ii) it becomes impossible or impracticable to calculate the indexed rent in accordance with this paragraph 4.21,</p>
          <p id="s1p512">This alternative mechanism may (where reasonable) include, or consist of, substituting an alternative index for the RPL. In default of agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant on an alternative mechanism for setting the Car Parking Rent, the Surveyor shall determine an alternative mechanism.</p>

          <p id="s1p517">The Surveyor shall have full power to determine the question, dispute or disagreement. When determining such a question, dispute or disagreement, the Surveyor may, if he considers it appropriate, specify that an alternative mechanism for setting the Car Parking Rent should apply to this lease, and this includes (but is not limited to) substituting an alternative index for the RPI.</p>
          <p id="s1p518">(J) The Surveyor shall be an independent valuer who is a Member or Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The Landlord and the Tenant may, by agreement, appoint the Surveyor at any time before either of them applies to the President for the Surveyor to be appointed.</p>
          <p id="s1p519">(K) The Surveyor shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Surveyor’s decision shall be given in writing, and the Surveyor shall provide reasons for any determination. The Surveyor’s written decision on the matters referred to him shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error or fraud.</p>
          <p id="s1p520">(L) The Surveyor shall give the Landlord and the Tenant an opportunity to make written representations to the Surveyor and to make written counter-representations commenting on the representations of the other party to the Surveyor.
